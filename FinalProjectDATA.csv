We conceptualize the resources as probabilistic processes from the setting variables to the outcome variables having a particular causal structure, namely, one wherein the wings are only connected by a common cause. We term them ``common-cause boxes''. We define the distinction between classical and nonclassical resources in terms of whether or not a classical causal model can explain the correlations. We then quantify the relative nonclassicality of resources by considering their interconvertibility relative to the set of operations that can be implemented using a classical common cause (which correspond to local operations and shared randomness). We prove that the set of free operations forms a polytope, which in turn allows us to derive an efficient algorithm for deciding whether one resource can be converted to another. We moreover define two distinct monotones with simple closed-form expressions in the two-party binary-setting binary-outcome scenario, and use these to reveal various properties of the pre-order of resources, including a lower bound on the cardinality of any complete set of monotones. In particular, we show that the information contained in the degrees of violation of facet-defining Bell inequalities is not sufficient for quantifying nonclassicality, even though it is sufficient for witnessing nonclassicality. Finally, we show that the continuous set of convexly extremal quantumly realizable correlations are all at the top of the preorder of quantumly realizable correlations. In addition to providing new insights on Bell nonclassicality, our work also sets the stage for quantifying nonclassicality in more general causal networks."
15,53,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,4.0,3.0,1903.06346v1,Optimal FX Hedge Tenor with Liquidity Risk,"We develop an optimal currency hedging strategy for fund managers who own foreign assets to choose the hedge tenors that maximize their FX carry returns within a liquidity risk constraint. The strategy assumes that the offshore assets are fully hedged with FX forwards. The chosen liquidity risk metric is Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR). The strategy involves time-dispersing the total nominal hedge value into future time buckets to maximize (minimize) the expected FX carry benefit (cost), given the constraint that the CFaRs in all the future time buckets do not breach a predetermined liquidity budget. We demonstrate the methodology via an illustrative example where shorter-dated forwards are assumed to deliver higher carry trade returns (motivated by the historical experience where AUD is the domestic currency and USD is the foreign currency). We also introduce a tenor-ranking method which is useful when this assumption fails. We show by Monte Carlo simulation and by backtesting that our hedging strategy successfully operates within the liquidity budget. We provide practical insights on when and why fund managers should choose short-dated or long-dated tenors."

With the advance of machine learning, some recent works have attempted to address the problem using convolutional neural network (CNN) and have showed promising results. FlowNet2, the state-of-the-art CNN, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow estimation. Our LiteFlowNet2 outperforms FlowNet2 on Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, while being 25.3 times smaller in the model size and 3.1 times faster in the running speed. LiteFlowNet2 is built on the foundation laid by conventional methods and resembles the corresponding roles as data fidelity and regularization in variational methods. We compute optical flow in a spatial-pyramid formulation as SPyNet but through a novel lightweight cascaded flow inference. It provides high flow estimation accuracy through early correction with seamless incorporation of descriptor matching. Flow regularization is used to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow boundaries through feature-driven local convolutions. Our network also owns an effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2 and SPyNet. Comparing to LiteFlowNet, LiteFlowNet2 improves the optical flow accuracy on Sintel Clean by 23.3%, Sintel Final by 12.8%, KITTI 2012 by 19.6%, and KITTI 2015 by 18.8%, while being 2.2 times faster. Our network protocol and trained models are made publicly available on https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet2."

By calculating the two-point correlation function of a vector $\bar q\gamma_\mu q$ (scalar $\bar q q$) current and a hybrid (glueball) current we are able to estimate the mass and the decay constants of the corresponding mixed ""physical state"" that couples to both currents. Our results do not support strong quark/gluonic mixing for either the $1^{--}$ or the $0^{++}$ states."

In the limiting case, it becomes the Lie algebra of operators of the canonical quantum theory. Structure constants of the general Lie algebra depend on the known constants c and h, as well as additional constants with dimensions of action (H), length (L), and mass (M). It is presented some realizations of general Lie algebra operators and equations for HLM generalized fields forming particular representation spaces of the HLM algebra."

We show the asymptotic normality of the two-step nonparametric estimator of Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong (2000) (GPV), and propose an easily implementable and consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance. We prove the validity of the pointwise percentile bootstrap confidence intervals based on the GPV estimator. Lastly, we use the intermediate Gaussian approximation approach to construct bootstrap-based asymptotically valid uniform confidence bands for the density of the valuations."

Here we examine how coherent splitting at such intersections is affected by inter-particle interactions, in the special case of an intersection of topological edge states. We derive an effective impurity model which represents the edge-state intersection within Luttinger liquid theory at low energy. For Luttinger K = 1 / 2 , we compute the exact time-dependent expectation values of the charge density as well as the density-density correlation functions. In general a single incoming charge density wave packet will split into four outgoing wave packets with transmission and reflection coefficients depending on the strengths of the tunnelling processes between the wires at the junction. We find that when multiple charge density wave packets from different directions pass through the intersection at the same time, reflection and splitting of the packets depend on the relative phases of the waves. Active use of this phase-dependent splitting of wave packets may make Luttinger interferometry possible. We also find that coherent incident packets generally suffer partial decoherence from the intersection, with some of their initially coherent signal being transferred into correlated quantum noise. In an extreme case four incident coherent wave packets can be transformed entirely into density-density correlations, with the charge density itself having zero expectation value everywhere in the final state."
42,163,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,3.0,3.0,1903.06450v1,A domain mapping approach for elliptic equations posed on random bulk   and surface domains,"In this article, we analyse the domain mapping method approach to approximate statistical moments of solutions to linear elliptic partial differential equations posed over random geometries including smooth surfaces and bulk-surface systems. In particular, we present the necessary geometric analysis required by the domain mapping method to reformulate elliptic equations on random surfaces onto a fix deterministic surface using a prescribed stochastic parametrisation of the random domain. An abstract analysis of a finite element discretisation coupled with a Monte-Carlo sampling is presented for the resulting elliptic equations with random coefficients posed over the fixed curved reference domain and optimal error estimates are derived. The results from the abstract framework are applied to a model elliptic problem on a random surface and a coupled elliptic bulk-surface system and the theoretical convergence rates are confirmed by numerical experiments."

In the normal state a good description of the low-frequency response is obtained with a superposition of two Drude components of which one has a very low scattering rate (narrow Drude-peak) and the other a rather large one (broad Drude-peak). Well below $T_c \sim 29$~K, a pronounced gap feature is observed which involves a complete suppression of the optical conductivity below $\sim$ 110~cm$^{-1}$ and thus is characteristic of a nodeless superconducting state. The optical response of the broad Drude-component can be described with a dirty-limit Mattis-Bardeen-type response with a single isotropic gap of $2\Delta \simeq 14$~meV. To the contrary, the response of the narrow Drude-component is in the ultra-clean-limit and its entire spectral weight is transferred to the zero-frequency $\delta(\omega)$ function that accounts for the loss-free response of the condensate. These observations provide clear evidence for a band-selective coexistence of clean- and dirty-limit superconductivity with nodeless gaps in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$."
59,205,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,7.0,1.0,1903.06487v3,"Nucleon axial, scalar, and tensor charges using lattice QCD at the   physical pion mass","We report on lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon isovector axial, scalar, and tensor charges. Our calculations are performed on two 2+1-flavor ensembles generated using a 2-HEX-smeared Wilson-clover action at the physical pion mass and lattice spacings $a\approx$ 0.116 and 0.093 fm. We use a wide range of source-sink separations - eight values ranging from roughly 0.4 to 1.4 fm on the coarse ensemble and three values from 0.9 to 1.5 fm on the fine ensemble - which allows us to perform an extensive study of excited-state effects using different analysis and fit strategies. To determine the renormalization factors, we use the nonperturbative Rome-Southampton approach and compare RI'-MOM and RI-SMOM intermediate schemes to estimate the systematic uncertainties. Our final results are computed in the MS-bar scheme at scale 2 GeV. The tensor and axial charges have uncertainties of roughly 4%, $g_T=0.972(41)$ and $g_A=1.265(49)$. The resulting scalar charge, $g_S=0.927(303)$, has a much larger uncertainty due to a stronger dependence on the choice of intermediate renormalization scheme and on the lattice spacing."
63,216,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,1.0,1.0,1903.06502v1,Prescribing The Gauss Curvature Of Convex Bodies In Hyperbolic Space,"The Gauss curvature measure of a pointed Euclidean convex body is a measure on the unit sphere which extends the notion of Gauss curvature to non-smooth bodies. Alexandrov's problem consists in finding a convex body with given curvature measure. In Euclidean space, A.D. Alexandrov gave a necessary and sufficient condition on the measure for this problem to have a solution. In this paper, we address Alexandrov's problem for convex bodies in the hyperbolic space H m+1. After defining the Gauss curvature measure of an arbitrary hyperbolic convex body, we completely solve Alexandrov's problem in this setting. Contrary to the Euclidean case, we also prove the uniqueness of such a convex body. The methods for proving existence and uniqueness of the solution to this problem are both new."
72,247,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,1.0,2.0,1903.06544v3,The Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background from Core Dominated Radio   Galaxies,"Recent radio surveys have discovered a large number of low luminosity core dominated radio galaxies that are much more abundant than those at higher luminosities. These objects will be too faint in gamma-rays to be detected individually by Fermi. Nevertheless, they may contribute significantly to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background. We consider here the possible contribution of these core dominated radio galaxies to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background. Using published data available for all 45 of the radiogalaxies listed as detected counterparts in the Fermi FL8Y source list update to the 3FGL catalog, we have searched for radio maps which can resolve the core flux from the total source flux. Using high resolution radio maps we were able to obtain core fluxes for virtually every source. We then derived a relation between core radio flux and gamma-ray flux that we extrapolated to sources with low radio luminosities that are known to be highly core dominated. We then employed a very recent determination of the luminosity function for core dominated radio galaxies in order to obtain the contribution of all possible gamma-ray emitting radio galaxies to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find this contribution to be a possibly non-negligible, 4% - 18% of the background."

A four-modes pattern reconfigurable element based on microstrip Yagi antenna is proposed, and then developed into the 4X4 phased array, in which two feed points are introduced to reduce sidelobe level (SLL). The simulated results show that our proposed phased array is able to cover the scanning range from -60{\deg} to +60{\deg}in H-plane(yoz-plane) and -47.2{\deg}to +47.2{\deg}in E-plane(xoz-plane) with the gain reduction less than 3dB, both the SLLs of which are 10dB less than main beam. The two-dimensional scanning phased array based on pattern reconfigurable antenna (PRA) presented here is suitable for the satellite communication."
78,262,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,3.0,5.0,1903.06565v1,Role of Bloom Filter in Big Data Research: A Survey,"Big Data is the most popular emerging trends that becomes a blessing for human kinds and it is the necessity of day-to-day life. For example, Facebook. Every person involves with producing data either directly or indirectly. Thus, Big Data is a high volume of data with exponential growth rate that consists of a variety of data. Big Data touches all fields, including Government sector, IT industry, Business, Economy, Engineering, Bioinformatics, and other basic sciences. Thus, Big Data forms a data silo. Most of the data are duplicates and unstructured. To deal with such kind of data silo, Bloom Filter is a precious resource to filter out the duplicate data. Also, Bloom Filter is inevitable in a Big Data storage system to optimize the memory consumption. Undoubtedly, Bloom Filter uses a tiny amount of memory space to filter a very large data size and it stores information of a large set of data. However, functionality of the Bloom Filter is limited to membership filter, but it can be adapted in various applications. Besides, the Bloom Filter is deployed in diverse field, and also used in the interdisciplinary research area. Bioinformatics, for instance. In this article, we expose the usefulness of Bloom Filter in Big Data research."
80,287,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,5.0,1.0,1903.06591v1,Probabilistic inequalities and measurements in bipartite systems,"Various inequalities (Boole inequality, Chung-Erd\""os inequality, Frechet inequality) for Kolmogorov (classical) probabilities are considered. Quantum counterparts of these inequalities are introduced, which have an extra `quantum correction' term, and which hold for all quantum states. When certain sufficient conditions are satisfied, the quantum correction term is zero, and the classical version of these inequalities holds for all states. But in general, the classical version of these inequalities is violated by some of the quantum states. For example in bipartite systems, classical Boole inequalities hold for all rank one (factorizable) states, and are violated by some rank two (entangled) states. A logical approach to CHSH inequalities (which are related to the Frechet inequalities), is studied in this context.It is shown that CHSH inequalities hold for all rank one (factorizable) states, and are violated by some rank two (entangled) states. The reduction of the rank of a pure state by a quantum measurement with both orthogonal and coherent projectors, is studied. Bounds for the average rank reduction are given."
99,344,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,1.0,1.0,1903.07427v3,Crowd Counting with Decomposed Uncertainty,"Research in neural networks in the field of computer vision has achieved remarkable accuracy for point estimation. However, the uncertainty in the estimation is rarely addressed. Uncertainty quantification accompanied by point estimation can lead to a more informed decision, and even improve the prediction quality. In this work, we focus on uncertainty estimation in the domain of crowd counting. With increasing occurrences of heavily crowded events such as political rallies, protests, concerts, etc., automated crowd analysis is becoming an increasingly crucial task. The stakes can be very high in many of these real-world applications. We propose a scalable neural network framework with quantification of decomposed uncertainty using a bootstrap ensemble. We demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty quantification method provides additional insight to the crowd counting problem and is simple to implement. We also show that our proposed method exhibits the state of the art performances in many benchmark crowd counting datasets."
103,365,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,1.0,1.0,1903.06686v1,Nonvanishing of self-dual $L$-values via spectral decomposition of   shifted convolution sums,"We obtain nonvanishing estimates for central values of self-dual Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions on $\operatorname{GL}_2$, and more generally central values of (automorphic) $N$-fold tensor products of $\operatorname{GL}_2$ forms, over a totally real number field. This is achieved by developing a spectral approach to the shifted convolution problem for coefficients of $\operatorname{GL}_2$-automorphic forms over totally real fields, and the bounds we obtain depend on the best known approximations to the generalized Ramanujan conjecture and the generalized Lindel\""of hypothesis. In the course of deriving such results, we supply the required nonvanishing hypothesis for recent work of Darmon-Rotger to bound Mordell-Weil ranks of elliptic curves in number fields cut out by tensor products of two odd, two-dimensional Artin representations whose product of determinants is trivial. This in particular allows us to deduce bounds (on average) for Mordell-Weil ranks of elliptic curves in ring class extensions of real quadratic fields which had not been accessible previously."
111,383,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,6.0,2.0,1903.06711v2,"The detached, evolved post-mass-exchange binary V643 Orionis","Context: One of the greatest uncertainties in modelling the mass-exchange phases during the evolution of a binary system is the amount of mass and angular momentum that has been lost from the system. To constrain this problem, a favourable, evolved and detached real binary system is valuable as an example of the end result of this process. Aims: We study the 52-day post-mass-exchange eclipsing binary V643 Ori from complete uvby light curves and high-resolution spectra. V643 Ori is a double-lined, circular orbit, synchronized binary showing total primary eclipses. Results: We determine accurate masses of 3.3 and 1.9 M(Sun) and radii of 16 and 21 R(Sun). The masses and radii are incompatible with undisturbed post-main-sequence evolution. Conclusions: We have attempted to simulate the past evolutionary history of V643 Ori under both conservative and non-conservative Case B mass transfer scenarios. In the non-conservative case we varied the amounts of mass and angular momentum loss needed to arrive at the present masses in a circular 52-day orbit, keeping the two stars detached and synchronized as now observed, but without following the evolution of other stellar properties in any detail. Multiple possible solutions were found. Further attempts were made using both the BSE formalism and the binary MESA code in order to track stellar evolution more closely, and make use of the measured radii and temperatures as important additional constraints. Those efforts did not yield satisfactory solutions, possibly due to limitations in handling mass transfer in evolved stars such as these. We remain hopeful that future theoreticians can more fully model the system under realistic conditions."
117,406,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,2.0,2.0,1903.06734v1,Conformal Killing forms on nearly KÃ¤hler manifolds,"We study conformal Killing forms on compact 6-dimensional nearly K\""ahler manifolds. Our main result concerns forms of degree 3. Here we give a classification showing that all conformal Killing 3-forms are linear combinations of $d \omega$ and its Hodge dual $* d\omega$ where $\omega$ is the fundamental 2-form of the nearly K\""ahler structure. The proof is based on a fundamental integrability condition for conformal Killing forms. We have partial results in the case of conformal Killing 2-forms. In particular we show the non-existence of J-anti-invariant Killing 2-forms."
119,414,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,2.0,2.0,1903.06742v3,On the properties of the massive binary black hole merger GW170729,"We present a detailed investigation into the properties of GW170729, the gravitational wave with the most massive and distant source confirmed to date. We employ an extensive set of waveform models, including new improved models that incorporate the effect of higher-order waveform modes which are particularly important for massive systems. We find no indication of spin-precession, but the inclusion of higher-order modes in the models results in an improved estimate for the mass ratio of $(0.3-0.8)$ at the 90\% credible level. Our updated measurement excludes equal masses at that level. We also find that models with higher-order modes lead to the data being more consistent with a smaller effective spin, with the probability that the effective spin is greater than zero being reduced from $99\%$ to $94\%$. The 90\% credible interval for the effective spin parameter is now $(-0.01-0.50)$. Additionally, the recovered signal-to-noise ratio increases by $\sim0.3$ units compared to analyses without higher-order modes. We study the effect of common spin priors on the derived spin and mass measurements, and observe small shifts in the spins, while the masses remain unaffected. We argue that our conclusions are robust against systematic errors in the waveform models. We also compare the above waveform-based analysis which employs compact-binary waveform models to a more flexible wavelet- and chirplet-based analysis. We find consistency between the two, with overlaps of $\sim 0.9$, typical of what is expected from simulations of signals similar to GW170729, confirming that the data are well-described by the existing waveform models. Finally, we study the possibility that the primary component of GW170729 was the remnant of a past merger of two black holes and find this scenario to be indistinguishable from the standard formation scenario."
128,448,2019-03-15,2019-03-15,physics,4.0,1.0,1903.06782v3,Bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered free-fermion topological   phases,"Guided by the many-particle quantum theory of interacting systems, we develop a uniform classification scheme for topological phases of disordered gapped free fermions, encompassing all symmetry classes of the Tenfold Way. We apply this scheme to give a mathematically rigorous proof of bulk-boundary correspondence. To that end, we construct real C$^\ast$-algebras harbouring the bulk and boundary data of disordered free-fermion ground states. These we connect by a natural bulk-to-boundary short exact sequence, realising the bulk system as a quotient of the half-space theory modulo boundary contributions. To every ground state, we attach two classes in different pictures of real operator $K$-theory (or $KR$-theory): a bulk class, using Van Daele's picture, along with a boundary class, using Kasparov's Fredholm picture. We then show that the connecting map for the bulk-to-boundary sequence maps these $KR$-theory classes to each other. This implies bulk-boundary correspondence, in the presence of disorder, for both the ""strong"" and the ""weak"" invariants."

We conduct a thorough intercomparison survey with several established forward models, including COOLTLUSTY, PHOENIX, and find satisfactory consistency with their results. Then, we explore the impact of (i) different groups of opacity sources, (ii) a stellar path length adjustment, and (iii) a scattering correction on self-consistently calculated atmospheric temperatures and planetary emission spectra. First, we observe that temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles are very sensitive to the opacities included, with metal oxides, hydrides, the alkali atoms (and ionized hydrogen) playing an important role for the absorption of shortwave radiation (in very hot surroundings). Moreover, if these species are sufficiently abundant, they are likely to induce non-monotonic T-P profiles. Second, without the stellar path length adjustment, the incoming stellar flux is significantly underestimated for zenith angles above 80{\deg}, which somewhat affects the upper atmospheric temperatures and the planetary emission. Third, the scattering correction improves the accuracy of the computation of the reflected stellar light by ~10%. We use HELIOS to calculate a grid of cloud-free atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium for self-luminous planets for a range of effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and C/O ratios, to be used by planetary evolution studies. Furthermore, we calculate dayside temperatures and secondary eclipse spectra for a sample of exoplanets for varying chemistry and heat redistribution. These results may be used to make predictions on the feasibility of atmospheric characterizations with future observations."

In this paper, a probable prime test is developed using quadratic polynomials and the Frobenius automorphism. The test, along with a fixed number of trial divisions, ensures that a composite $n$ will pass for less than $\frac 1{7710}$ of the polynomials $x^2-bx-c$ with $\left(b^2+4c\over n\right)=-1$ and $\left(-c\over n\right)=1$.

The dominant approach to object recognition in images and range images is classification by supervised machine learning, nowadays mostly with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This works well for target classes whose variability can be completely covered with training examples. However, a robot moving in the wild, i.e., in an environment that is not known at the time the recognition system is trained, will often face \emph{domain shift}: the training data cannot be assumed to exhaustively cover all the within-class variability that will be encountered in the test data. In that situation, learning is in principle possible, since the training set does capture the defining properties, respectively dissimilarities, of the target classes. But directly training a CNN to predict class probabilities is prone to overfitting to irrelevant correlations between the class labels and the specific subset of the target class that is represented in the training set. We explore the idea to instead learn a Siamese CNN that acts as similarity function between pairs of training examples. Class predictions are then obtained by measuring the similarities between a new test instance and the training samples. We show that the CNN embedding correctly recovers the relative similarities to arbitrary class exemplars in the training set. And that therefore few, randomly picked training exemplars are sufficient to achieve good predictions, making the procedure efficient."

While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to obtain 3D images of plant roots, extracting the root structural model is challenging due to highly noisy soil environments and low-resolution of MRI images. To improve both contrast and resolution, we adapt the state-of-the-art method RefineNet for 3D segmentation of the plant root MRI images in super-resolution. The networks are trained from few manual segmentations that are augmented by geometric transformations, realistic noise, and other variabilities. The resulting segmentations contain most root structures, including branches not extracted by the human annotator."

In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn-Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange correlation functional ``starting point'', are used to construct $G$ and $W$, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant $GW$ self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the $GW$ self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO$_2$, reported $GW$ fundamental gaps can vary by more than 1 eV. In this work, we address the convergence and key approximations in contemporary $G_0W_0$ calculations, including frequency-integration schemes and the treatment of the Coulomb divergence in the exact-exchange term. We study several systems,and compare three different $GW$ codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the same quasiparticle energies for systems in the condensed phase can be obtained with different codes, and we provide a comprehensive assessment of implementations of the $GW$ approximation."

It is shown that the phonon statistics differ between bosons and fermions. The average energy and density profiles are obtained numerically as a function of temperature. A surprisingly large number of energy levels (eg.\ 5,000 for 4 particles) are required for reliable results at even moderate temperatures. Differences between fully symmetric and anti-symmetric spinless wave functions are quantified in the high density and low coupling regimes. The localized nature of wave function symmetrization is demonstrated. Appended are generic discussions of non-symmetric Hamiltonian operator and fermionic phonons, the symmetrization for multi-particle states, and the symmetrization factorization of spin and position wave functions."

The IoT devices of both the PIoT and the SIoT respectively monitor one physical process and send randomly generated status updates to their associated access points (APs). The timeliness of the status updates is important as the systems are interested in the latest condition (e.g., temperature, speed and position) of the IoT device. In this context, two natural questions arise: (1) How to characterize the timeliness of the status updates in CR-IoT systems? (2) Which scheme, overlay or underlay, is better in terms of the timeliness of the status updates. To answer these two questions, we adopt a new performance metric, named the age of information (AoI). We analyze the average peak AoI of the PIoT and the SIoT for overlay and underlay schemes, respectively. Simple asymptotic expressions of the average peak AoI are also derived when the PIoT operates at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on the asymptotic expressions, we characterize a critical generation rate of the PIoT system, which can determine the superiority of overlay and underlay schemes in terms of the average peak AoI of the SIoT. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and uncover that the overlay and underlay schemes can outperform each other in terms of the average peak AoI of the SIoT for different system setups."

By assuming that the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is equal to that of users, we characterize achievable rates of both pure analog detection and hybrid detection under the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel model. From the derived expressions, we discover that the analog processing can outperform the hybrid processing using the maximal ratio combining (MRC) or zero-forcing (ZF) criterion in cases under some engineering assumptions. Performance comparison of the schemes are presented under tests with various numbers of users and numbers of antennas at the base station."

We show that it is possible to treat neighborhood models, introduced earlier, as multi-topological. From the neighborhood point of view, our method is based on differences between properties of minimal and maximal neighborhoods. Also we propose transformation of multi-topological spaces into the neighborhood structures. Although our neighborhoods can be considered as bi-relational models, we believe that reasoning in terms of neighborhoods gives better topological intuitions."

Here, we demonstrate quantum key distribution using time-bin photonic states distorted by turbulence and depolarization during free-space transmission. Utilizing a novel analyzer apparatus, we observe stable quantum bit error ratios of 5.32 %, suitable for generating secure keys, despite significant wavefront distortions and polarization fluctuations across a 1.2 km channel. This shows the viability of time-bin quantum communication over long-distance free-space channels, which will simplify direct fiber/free-space interfaces and enable new approaches for practical free-space quantum communication over multi-mode, turbulent, or depolarizing channels."

Here, we develop a novel compressive spectral imaging technique using diffractive lenses. Our technique uses a coded aperture to spatially modulate the optical field from the scene and a diffractive lens such as a photon-sieve for dispersion. The coded field is passed through the diffractive lens and then measured at a few planes using a monochrome detector. The 3D spectral cube is then reconstructed from these highly compressed measurements through sparse recovery. A fast sparse recovery method is developed to solve this large-scale inverse problem. The imaging performance is illustrated at visible regime for various scenarios with different compression ratios through numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that promising reconstruction performance can be achieved with as little as two measurements. This opens up new possibilities for high resolution spectral imaging with low-cost and simple designs."

The agents' criteria for this game are describing a trade off between self-consistent and manipulative behaviors. Their best response strategies are resulting in two dynamics rules, one for the agents' opinions and one for their actions. The stability properties of these dynamics are studied. In the case of instability, the stabilization of these dynamics through the design of the network topology is formulated as a constrained integer programming problem. The constraints have the form of a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI), which is known to result in a nonconvex feasible set in the general case. To deal with this problem a Genetic Algorithm is designed. Finally, simulations are presented for several different initial topologies and conclusions are derived concerning both the functionality of the algorithm and the advisability of the problem formulation."

In the present paper, we propose utilizing some recent algorithms, that were originally proposed for continuous multi-objective problems with three and four objectives and with disconnected feasible domains, for these integer and mixed-integer programming problems. We also present a new extension of these algorithms for four objectives. We test the proposed algorithms by means of two-, three- and four-objective problems, and make comparisons with other existing algorithms to illustrate efficiency. In particular, we apply the new four-objective algorithm to a rocket injector design problem with a discrete variable, which is a challenging four-objective mixed-integer programming problem."

With the recent success of deep neural networks in various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, researchers started adopting these techniques for solving time series data mining problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has considered the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial time series examples, which could potentially make them unreliable in situations where the decision taken by the classifier is crucial such as in medicine and security. For computer vision problems, such attacks have been shown to be very easy to perform by altering the image and adding an imperceptible amount of noise to trick the network into wrongly classifying the input image. Following this line of work, we propose to leverage existing adversarial attack mechanisms to add a special noise to the input time series in order to decrease the network's confidence when classifying instances at test time. Our results reveal that current state-of-the-art deep learning time series classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can have major consequences in multiple domains such as food safety and quality assurance."

We advocate the use of the Thompson Sampling principle, a flexible algorithm that can accommodate different types of monotonicity assumptions on the toxicity and efficacy of the doses. For the simplest version of Thompson Sampling, based on a uniform prior distribution for each dose, we provide finite-time upper bounds on the number of sub-optimal dose selections, which is unprecedented for dose-finding algorithms. Through a large simulation study, we then show that variants of Thompson Sampling based on more sophisticated prior distributions outperform state-of-the-art dose identification algorithms in different types of dose-finding studies that occur in phase I or phase I/II trials."

Despite various approaches to train such models, they have difficulty with zero-shot translation: translating between language pairs that were not together seen during training. In this paper we first diagnose why state-of-the-art multilingual NMT models that rely purely on parameter sharing, fail to generalize to unseen language pairs. We then propose auxiliary losses on the NMT encoder that impose representational invariance across languages. Our simple approach vastly improves zero-shot translation quality without regressing on supervised directions. For the first time, on WMT14 English-FrenchGerman, we achieve zero-shot performance that is on par with pivoting.

Since small scales are difficult to model, this non-locality has generally required stringent scale cuts or new statistics for cosmological analyses. Using the fact that uncertainty in these contributions corresponds to an uncertainty in the enclosed projected mass around the lens, we provide an analytic marginalization scheme to account for this. Our approach enables the inclusion of measurements on smaller scales without requiring numerical sampling over extra free parameters. We extend the analytic marginalization formalism to retain cosmographic (""shear-ratio"") information from small-scale measurements that would otherwise be removed due to modeling uncertainties, again without requiring the addition of extra sampling parameters. We test the methodology using simulated likelihood analysis of a DES Year 5-like galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering datavector. We demonstrate that we can remove parameter biases due to the presence of an un-modeled 1-halo contamination of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, and use the shear-ratio information on small scales to improve cosmological parameter constraints."

NetKernel represents a new paradigm where network stack can be managed as part of the virtualized infrastructure. It provides important efficiency benefits: By gaining control and visibility of the network stack, operator can perform network management more directly and flexibly, such as multiplexing VMs running different applications to the same network stack module to save CPU cores, and enforcing fair bandwidth sharing with distributed congestion control. Users also benefit from the simplified stack deployment and better performance. For example mTCP can be deployed without API change to support nginx natively, and shared memory networking can be readily enabled to improve performance of colocated VMs. Testbed evaluation using 100G NICs shows that NetKernel preserves the performance and scalability of both kernel and userspace network stacks, and provides the same isolation as the current architecture."

Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories, do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric, regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly larger AUC of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount of missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best performance up until more than 74% missing values. Finally, it is illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals."

The urban agglomerations are used to understand the structure and growth of cities. However, the major challenge is to extract urban agglomerations from big data, which can reflect human activities. Community urban cluster refers to spatially clustered geographic events, such as human settlements or activities. It provides a powerful and innovative insight to analyze the structure and growth of the real city. In order to understand the shape and growth of urban agglomerations in Switzerland from spatial and temporal aspects, this work identifies urban clusters from nighttime light data and street network data. Nighttime light data record lights emitted from human settlements at night on the earth's surface. This work uses DMSP-OLS Nighttime light data to extract urban clusters from 1992 to 2013. The street is one of the most important factors to reflect human activities. Hence, urban clusters are also extracted from street network data to understand the structure of cities. Both of these data have a heavy-tailed distribution, which includes power laws as well as lognormal and exponential distributions. The head/tail breaks is a classification method to find the hierarchy of data with a heavy-tailed distribution. This work uses head/tail breaks classification to extract urban clusters of Switzerland. At last, the power law distribution of all the urban clusters was detected at the country level."

The pilot signal of each user is expressed as a weighted superposition of orthonormal pilot sequence basis, where the power assigned to each pilot sequence is the corresponding weight. A multi-layer fully connected deep neural network (DNN) is designed to optimize the power allocated to each pilot sequence to minimize the sum MSE, which takes the channel large-scale fading coefficients as input and outputs the pilot power allocation vector. The loss function of the DNN is defined as the sum MSE, and we leverage the unsupervised learning strategy to train the DNN. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better sum MSE performance than other methods with low complexity."

We use the ten-year Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) archival data to place a flux upper limit in the energy range of 100 MeV$-$10 GeV at the position of the source, which is $\sim 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for a six-month time bin on average, and $2.35\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the entire ten-year time span. For the maximum redshift of $z=0.11$, the ten-year upper limit of luminosity is $7.32\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We utilize these upper limits to constrain the FRB progenitor and central engine. For the rotation-powered young magnetar model, the upper limits can pose constraints on the allowed parameter space for the initial rotational period and surface magnetic field of the magnetar. We also place significant constraints on the kinetic energy of a relativistic external shock wave, ruling out the possibility that there existed a gamma-ray burst (GRB) beaming towards earth during the past ten years as the progenitor of the repeater. The case of an off-beam GRB is also constrained if the viewing angle is not much greater than the jet opening angle.

A novel concept of Time-Warped Grid is introduced to predict the pose of obstacles in the environment and avoid collisions. The algorithm is implemented using C/C++ and the CUDA programming environment, and combines stochastic estimation (Kalman filter), harmonic potential fields and a rubber band model, and it translates naturally into the parallel paradigm of GPU programming. In simple terms, time-warped grids are progressively wider orbits around the mobile robot. Those orbits represent the variable time intervals estimated by the robot to reach detected obstacles. The proposed method was tested using several simulation scenarios for the Pioneer P3-DX robot, which demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm by finding the optimum path in terms of smoothness, distance, and collision-free, in both static or dynamic environments, and with large number of obstacles."

Since the expected pile-up is around 200, with an r.m.s. time spread of 180 ps, a time resolution of about 30 ps is needed. The timing detectors will experience a 1-MeV neutron equivalent fluence of about $\Phi_{eq}=10^{14}$ and $10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the barrel and end-cap regions, respectively. In this contribution, deep diffused Avalanche Photo Diodes (APDs) produced by Radiation Monitoring Devices are examined as candidate timing detectors for HL-LHC applications.

In this letter, we demonstrate a quantum technique to extract the second-, and third-order chromatic dispersion of a short single-mode fiber using a fiber-based quantum nonlinear interferometer. The interferometer consists of two cascaded fiber-based biphoton sources, with each source acting as a nonlinear beamsplitter. A fiber under test is placed in between these two sources, and introduces a frequency-dependent phase that is imprinted upon the biphoton spectrum (interferogram) at the output of the interferometer. This interferogram contains within it the dispersion properties of the test fiber. Our technique has three novel features: (1) The broadband nature of the biphoton sources used in our setup allows accurate dispersion measurements on test devices with small dispersion-length products; (2) our all-fiber common-path interferometer requires no beam alignment or phase stabilization; (3) multiple phase-matching processes supported in our biphoton sources enables dispersion measurements at different wavelengths, which yields the third-order dispersion, achieved for the first time using a quantum optical technique."

However, its measurement is limited to clusters with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope data. Thanks to a set of state-of-the-art direct N-body simulations with up to 200k particles inclusive of stellar evolution, primordial binaries, and varying BH/neutron stars, we highlight for the first time the existence of a clear and tight linear relation between the degree of mass segregation and the cluster structural concentration index. The latter is defined as the ratio of the radii containing 5% and 50% of the integrated light ($R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$), making it robustly measurable without the need to individually resolve low-mass stars. Our simulations indicate that given $R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$, the mass segregation $\Delta m$ (defined as the difference in main sequence median mass between center and half-light radius) is expressed as $\Delta m/M_\odot = -1.166 R_5/R_\mathrm{h} + 0.3246$, with a root-mean-square error of $0.0148$. In addition, we can explain its physical origin and the values of the fitted parameters through basic analytical modeling. Such correlation is remarkably robust against a variety of initial conditions (including presence of primordial binaries and IMBHs) and cluster ages, with a slight dependence in best-fit parameters on the prescriptions used to measure the quantities involved. Therefore, this study highlights the potential to develop a new observational tool to gain insight on the dynamical status of globular clusters and on its dark remnants."

For the Big Data calculations, we use a custom build of stand-alone Spark/Hadoop cluster at Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) and Dataproc Compute Engine in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the sample size ranging from 7 millions to 200 millions. We find that among the many possible graph-topological measures, three simple ones: (1) the average of number of neighbors (the so-called average vertex degree) $\alpha$, (2) closed-to-connected triple fraction (the so-called transitivity) $\tau_\Delta$, and (3) the cumulative number density $n_{s\ge5}$ of subcomponents with connected component size $s \ge 5$, can effectively discriminate among the five model universes. Since these graph-topological measures are in direct relation with the usual $n$-points correlation functions of the cosmic density field, graph-topological statistics powered by Big Data computational infrastructure opens a new, intuitive, and computationally efficient window into the dark Universe."

The geometry of the networks was based on Voronoi tessellations, and had varying characteristic length scale and porosity. For a fixed network, FRAP experiments were performed in regions of increasing size. Our results indicate that the boundary of the bleached region, and in particular the cumulative area of the channels that connect the bleached region to the rest of the network, are important in the measured value of the effective diffusion coefficient. We found that the statistical geometrical variations between different regions of the network decrease with the size of the bleached region as a power law, meaning that the statistical error of effective medium approximations decrease with the size of the studied medium, although no characteristic length scale could be defined over which the porous medium is equivalent to an effective medium."

In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of supernovae (Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed supernovae. Supernova samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed supernovae detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged supernova still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed supernovae found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification.   We find that the ZTF will find about 2 type Ia and 4 core-collapse lensed supernovae per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed supernovae per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed supernovae will be dominated by type IIn supernovae contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of supernovae. Revisiting the case of the lensed supernova iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2\sigma contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the iPTF survey."

These entropic measures are nonadditive, and are mathematically deduced from a series of natural requirements.

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate that domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a practical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks."

Understanding the dynamics of this spacetime is important for testing theories of gravity and probing a regime which has not yet been studied with observations. In this paper, we construct an analytical solution for the exterior spacetime of a neutron star in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity that is independent of the equation of state chosen. The aim is to provide a metric that can be used to probe the strong-field regime near a neutron star and create predictions that can be compared with future observations to place possible constraints on the theory. In addition to constructing the metric, we examine a number of physical systems in order to see what deviations exist between our spacetime and that of general relativity. We find these deviations to be small and of higher post-Newtonian order than previous results using black hole solutions. The metric derived here can be used to further the study of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the strong field, and allow for constraints on corrections to general relativity with future observations."

It is easy to collect a dataset with noisy labels, but such noise makes networks overfit seriously and accuracies drop dramatically. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end framework called PENCIL, which can update both network parameters and label estimations as label distributions. PENCIL is independent of the backbone network structure and does not need an auxiliary clean dataset or prior information about noise, thus it is more general and robust than existing methods and is easy to apply. PENCIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins on both synthetic and real-world datasets with different noise types and noise rates. Experiments show that PENCIL is robust on clean datasets, too."

In order to achieve the highest possible measurement precision, it is critical to optimize the optical trapping efficiency. This work presents the development of a three-dimensional semi-classical Monte Carlo simulation of the optical trapping process and its application to optimizing the optical trapping efficiency of Radium for use in the search of the permanent electric dipole moment of $^{225}$Ra. The simulation includes an effusive-oven atomic beam source, transverse cooling and Zeeman slowing of an atomic beam, a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap, and additional processes such as collisions with residual gas molecules. We benchmark the simulation against a well-characterized $^{88}$Sr optical trap before applying it to the $^{225}$Ra optical trap. The simulation reproduces the relative gains in optical trapping efficiency measured in both the $^{88}$Sr and $^{225}$Ra optical traps. The measured and simulated values of the overall optical trapping efficiencies for $^{88}$Sr are in agreement; however, they differ by a factor of $30$ for $^{225}$Ra. Studies of several potential imperfections in the apparatus or systematic effects, such as atomic beam source misalignment and laser frequency noise, show only limited effects on the simulated trapping efficiency for $^{225}$Ra. We rule out any one systematic effect as the sole cause of the discrepancy between the simulated and measured $^{225}$Ra optical trapping efficiencies; but, we do expect that a combination of systematic effects contribute to this discrepancy. The accurate relative gains predicted by the simulation prove that it is useful for testing planned upgrades to the apparatus."

For these systems the concept of band structure along the synthetic dimension plays a central role in their theoretical description. Here we provide the first direct experimental measurement of the band structure along the synthetic dimension. By dynamically modulating a ring resonator at frequencies commensurate with its mode spacing, we realize a periodically driven system with a synthetic frequency dimension lattice. The strength and range of the couplings along the lattice can be dynamically reconfigured by changing the amplitude and frequency of modulation. We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that time-resolved transmission measurements of this system result in a direct ""read out"" of its band structure. We also show how long-range coupling, photonic gauge potentials and nonreciprocal bands can be realized in the system by simply incorporating additional frequency drives, enabling great flexibility in engineering the band structure."

When the network nodes are entangled in graph states, such quantum platform is indispensable to almost all the existing distributed quantum tasks. Unfortunately, real networks unavoidably suffer from noise and undesirable technical restrictions, making nodes transit from quantum to classical at worst. Here, we introduce a figure of merit in terms of the number of classical nodes for quantum networks in arbitrary graph states. This property of a network is evaluated by exploiting genuine multi-subsystem Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Experimentally, we demonstrate photonic quantum networks of $n_q$ quantum nodes and $n_c$ classical nodes with $n_q$ up to 6 and $n_c$ up to 18 using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources. We show that the proposed method is faithful in quantifying the classical defects in prepared multiphoton quantum networks. Our results provide novel characterization and identification of both generic quantum network architecture and multipartite non-classical correlations in graph states."

While experiments are fundamentally limited to the maximum of three spatial dimensions, there is a growing interest in harnessing additional synthetic dimensions. In our work, we introduce a new paradigm for the experimental realization of excitation dynamics associated with many-dimensional systems. Crucially, it relies solely on static one-dimensional equivalent structures with judiciously tailored parameters to faithfully reproduce the same optical spectrum and density of states of the high-dimensional system to be represented. In order to showcase the capabilities of our approach, we fabricate 1D photonic lattices that exhibit the characteristic non-monotonic excitation decays associated with quantum walks in up to 7D square lattices. Furthermore, we find that a new type of bound state at the edge of the continuum emerges in higher-than-three dimensions and gives rise to a sharp localisation transition at defect sites. In a series of experiments, we implement the mapped equivalent lattices of up to 5D systems and observe an extreme increase of sensitivity with respect to the detuning of the respective anchor sites. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and applicative potential of harnessing high-dimensional effects in planar photonics for ultra-sensitive switching or sensing. Notably, our general approach is by no means limited to optics, and can readily be adapted to a variety of other physical contexts, including cold atoms and superconducting qubits with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions, promising to drive significant advances in different fields including quantum simulations and information processing."

However, there are still several major challenges that remain unsolved. Among the most relevant ones, a major part of the state-of-the-art methods make implicit or explicit assumptions on the scenes -- e.g. box-shaped or Manhattan layouts. Also, current methods are computationally expensive and not suitable for real-time applications like robot navigation and AR/VR. In this work we present CFL (Corners for Layout), the first end-to-end model for 3D layout recovery on 360 images. Our experimental results show that we outperform the state of the art relaxing assumptions about the scene and at a lower cost. We also show that our model generalizes better to camera position variations than conventional approaches by using EquiConvs, a type of convolution applied directly on the sphere projection and hence invariant to the equirectangular distortions.

We consider the $ f(R,T) $ function as $ f(R)+f(T) $ which starts with a quadratic correction of the geometric term $ f(R) $ having structure $ f(R)=R+\alpha R^2 $, and a linear matter term $ f(T)=2\lambda T $. To achieve the solution of the gravitational field equations in the $ f(R,T) $ formalism, we take the form of a geometrical parameter, i.e. scale factor $ a(t)= sinh^{\frac{1}{n}}(\beta t) $ \cite{cha}, where $ \beta $ and $ n $ are model parameters. An eternal acceleration can be predicted by the model for $ 0<n<1 $, while the cosmic transition from the early decelerated phase to the present accelerated epoch can be anticipated for $ n\geq 1 $. The obtained model facilitate the formation of structure in the Universe according to the Jeans instability condition as our model transits from radiation dominated era to matter dominated era. We study the varying role of the equation of state parameter $ \omega $. We analyze our model by studying the behavior of the scalar field and discuss the energy conditions on our achieved solution.

In the past two years, we have made great progress in the development of APC Nb3Sn wires. Recent resistivity vs magnetic field measurements confirmed the high upper critical field (Bc2) of ternary APC wires, which at 4.2 K was ~28 T, about 1-2 T higher than present state-of-the-art conductors. In addition to high Bc2, it was found that APC wires have noticeably higher Sn content in the Nb3Sn layers as compared to standard wires. The Jc,non-Cu values of the most-recent APC wires have met the Jc,non-Cu-B specification required by the Future Circular Collider (FCC), with the best heat treatment leading to a Jc,nonCu 29% higher than the FCC specification at 21 T. Microscopy analysis shows that the APC wires still have overly high residual Nb fractions due to too low of a Sn/Nb ratio, indicating that there is still great potential for further Jc,non-Cu improvement. The development of APC wires is ongoing; this letter details some of the steps forward in the optimization and lays out a roadmap to push the APC wires towards practical, magnet-grade conductors."

One key feature is that it is immune to post-processing, which means that arbitrary post-hoc computations can be performed on privatized data without weakening differential privacy. It is therefore common to filter private data streams. To characterize this setup, in this paper we present error and entropy bounds for Kalman filtering differentially private state trajectories. We consider systems in which an output trajectory is privatized in order to protect the state trajectory that produced it. We provide bounds on a priori and a posteriori error and differential entropy of a Kalman filter which is processing the privatized output trajectories. Using the error bounds we develop, we then provide guidelines to calibrate privacy levels in order to keep filter error within pre-specified bounds. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate these developments."

Since the negative log-likelihood under multivariate normal sampling is convex in $\Sigma^{-1}$, the inverse of its covariance matrix, it is common to add to it a penalty which is also convex in $\Sigma^{-1}$. More recently, Deng-Tsui (2013) and Yu et al.(2017) have proposed penalties which are functions of the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$, and are convex in $\log \Sigma$, but not in $\Sigma^{-1}$. The resulting penalized optimization problem is not convex in either $\log \Sigma$ or $\Sigma^{-1}$. In this paper, we note that this optimization problem is geodesically convex in $\Sigma$, which allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding penalized covariance matrices. More generally, we show the equivalence of convexity in $\log \Sigma$ and geodesic convexity for penalties on $\Sigma$ which are strictly functions of their eigenvalues. In addition, when using such penalties, we show that the resulting optimization problem reduces to to a $q$-dimensional convex optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$, which can then be readily solved via Newton-Raphson. Finally, we argue that it is better to apply these penalties to the shape matrix $\Sigma/(\det \Sigma)^{1/q}$ rather than to $\Sigma$ itself. A simulation study and an example illustrate the advantages of applying the penalty to the shape matrix."

We give two related applications for metric graph distances, as well as an extension for the matching distance between multiparameter persistence modules."

In this model, the molecules have an orientational degree of freedom and the interactions depend on the relative orientations of nearest-neighbor molecules. We focus on the transition between the high-density liquid (HDL) phase and the isotropic gas phase in the limit of full occupancy ($\mu \to \infty$). Simulation results show a continuous phase transition at $\tau_c=k_BT_c/\gamma=0.4763(1)$ (where $-\gamma$ is the bond energy) between the low-temperature HDL phase, with a non-vanishing mean orientation of the molecules, and the high-temperature isotropic phase. Results for critical exponents and the Binder cumulant indicate that the transition belongs to the three-state Potts model universality class, even though the ALG Hamiltonian does not have the full permutation symmetry of the Potts model. In contrast with simulation, the Husimi lattice results furnish a discontinuous phase transition, characterized by a discontinuity of the nematic order parameter. The transition temperatures ($\tau_c=0.51403$ and $0.51207$ for trees built with triangles and hexagons, respectively) are slightly higher than the one found via simulation. Since the Husimi lattice studies show that the ALG phase diagram features a discontinuous gas-HDL line for finite $\mu$, three possible scenarios arise. The first is that in the limit $\mu \to \infty$ the first-order line ends in a critical point; the second is a change in the nature of the transition at some finite chemical potential; the third is that the entire line is one of continuous phase transitions. Results from other ALG models and the fact that mean-field approximations show a discontinuous phase transition for the three-state Potts model (known to possess a continuous transition) lends some weight to the third alternative."

Our contributions are as follows: 1) We construct new codes for matrix multiplication that achieve the same fault/straggler tolerance as the previously constructed MatDot Codes and Polynomial Codes. Unlike previous codes that use polynomials expanded in a monomial basis, our codes uses a basis of orthogonal polynomials. 2) We show that the condition number of every $m \times m$ sub-matrix of an $m \times n, n \geq m$ Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrix, evaluated on the $n$-point Chebyshev grid, grows as $O(n^{2(n-m)})$ for $n > m$. An implication of this result is that, when Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices are used for coded computing, for a fixed number of redundant nodes $s=n-m,$ the condition number grows at most polynomially in the number of nodes $n$. 3) By specializing our orthogonal polynomial based constructions to Chebyshev polynomials, and using our condition number bound for Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices, we construct new numerically stable techniques for coded matrix multiplication. We empirically demonstrate that our constructions have significantly lower numerical errors compared to previous approaches which involve inversion of Vandermonde matrices. We generalize our constructions to explore the trade-off between computation/communication and fault-tolerance. 4) We propose a numerically stable specialization of Lagrange coded computing. Motivated by our condition number bound, our approach involves the choice of evaluation points and a suitable decoding procedure that involves inversion of an appropriate Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrix. Our approach is demonstrated empirically to have lower numerical errors as compared to standard methods."

There are two computational approaches to count short cycles (with length smaller than $2g$, where $g$ is the girth of the graph) in bipartite graphs. The first approach is applicable to a general (irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum $\{\eta_i\}$ of the directed edge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity $N_k$ of $k$-cycles with $k < 2g$ through the simple equation $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$. This approach has a computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$, where $|E|$ is number of edges in the graph. The second approach is only applicable to bi-regular bipartite graphs, and uses the spectrum $\{\lambda_i\}$ of the adjacency matrix (graph spectrum) and the degree sequences of the graph to compute $N_k$. The complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$, where $|V|$ is number of nodes in the graph. This complexity is less than that of the first approach, but the equations involved in the computations of the second approach are very tedious, particularly for $k \geq g+6$. In this paper, we establish an analytical relationship between the two spectra $\{\eta_i\}$ and $\{\lambda_i\}$ for bi-regular bipartite graphs. Through this relationship, the former spectrum can be derived from the latter through simple equations. This allows the computation of $N_k$ using $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$ but with a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$ rather than $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$."

For typical exposure times of 40 s, the telescope is able to detect objects with a limiting magnitude up to 21.5. The aim is to observe those NEOs that are going to hit the Earth within a few weeks or days, in advance of impact. In order to estimate the detection rate of NEOs with the Flyeye telescope, a synthetic population of Earth threatening asteroids is created by means of the software NEOPOP. Then, the true anomalies and longitudes of the ascending node of these objects are modified in order to generate about 2500 impactors. In the simulations almost three impacts can be detected per year from NEOs down to 1 m using only one Flyeye telescope. When operating two telescopes simultaneously, one at Monte Mufara and one at La Silla, four detected impacts per year are expected. Nonetheless, it is estimated that about 15.6% of the Earth impactors will be very difficult to be detected using ground-based telescopes due to the fact that they are approaching us from the Sun."

More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic.   The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs).   This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree."

In this paper, such critical components are identified by the state-failure network (SF-network) formed by cascading failure chain and loss data, which can be gathered from either utilities or simulations. The failures along the chains are recombined in the SF-network, where each failure is allocated a value that can reveal the blackout risks after their occurrences. Thus, critical failures can be identified in the SF-network where the failures raise up blackout risks, and thus the critical components can be found based on their critical failure risks. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In recent versions of CRPropa, the ballistic single particle propagation mode aiming primarily at extragalactic cosmic rays has been complemented by a solver for the differential transport equation to address propagation of galactic cosmic rays. Additionally, modules have been developed to address cosmic ray acceleration and many improvements have been added for simulations of electromagnetic secondaries. In this contribution we will give an overview of the CRPropa simulation framework with a focus on the latest improvements and highlight selected features by example applications."

With lots of techniques being developed for the validation of smart contracts, the security problems of EVM have not been well-studied. In this paper, we propose EVMFuzz, aiming to detect vulnerabilities of EVMs with differential fuzz testing. The core idea of EVMFuzz is to continuously generate seed contracts for different EVMs' execution, so as to find as many inconsistencies among execution results as possible, eventually discover vulnerabilities with output cross-referencing. First, we present the evaluation metric for the internal inconsistency indicator, such as the opcode sequence executed and gas used. Then, we construct seed contracts via a set of predefined mutators and employ dynamic priority scheduling algorithm to guide seed contracts selection and maximize the inconsistency. Finally, we leverage different EVMs as crossreferencing oracles to avoid manual checking of the execution output. For evaluation, we conducted large-scale mutation on 36,295 real-world smart contracts and generated 253,153 smart contracts. Among them, 66.2% showed differential performance, including 1,596 variant contracts triggered inconsistent output among EVMs. Accompanied by manual root cause analysis, we found 5 previously unknown security bugs in four widely used EVMs, and all had been included in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database."

Drawings of planar graphs with few segments were intensively studied in the past years. However, the area requirements were only considered for limited subclasses of planar graphs. In this paper, we show that trees have drawings with $3n/4-1$ segments and $n^2$ area, improving the previous result of $O(n^{3.58})$. We also show that 3-connected planar graphs and biconnected outerplanar graphs have a drawing with $8n/3-O(1)$ and $3n/2-O(1)$ segments, respectively, and $O(n^3)$ area."

This study proposed novel approaches to detect stress based on fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in the feature-level using joint independent component analysis (jICA) and canonical correlation analysis method (CCA) and predected the level of stress using machine-learning approach. The jICA and CCA were then developed to combine the features to detect mental stress. The jICA fusion scheme discovers relationships between modalities by utilizing ICA to identify sources from each modality that modulate in the same way across subjects. The CCA fuse information from two sets of features to discover the associations across modalities and to ultimately estimate the sources responsible for these associations. The study further explored the functional connectivity (FC) and evaluated the performance of the fusion methods based on their classification performance and compared it with the result obtained by each individual modality. The jICA fusion technique significantly improved the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +3.46% compared to the EEG and +11.13% compared to the fNIRS. Similarly, CCA method improved the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +8.56% compared to the EEG and +13.03% compared to the fNIRS, respectively. The overall performance of the proposed fusion methods significantly improved the detection rate of mental stress, p<0.05. The FC significantly reduced under stress and suggested EEG and fNIRS as a potential biomarker of stress."

An experimental validation for the reflection problem is presented. The reflection and transmission of flexural waves in 1D resonant thin beams are analyzed by means of the transfer matrix method. The hypotheses, on which the analytical model relies, are validated by experimental results. The open lossy resonator, consisting of a finite length beam thinner than the main beam, presents both energy leakage due to the aperture of the resonators to the main beam and inherent losses due to the viscoelastic damping. Wave absorption is found to be limited by the balance between the energy leakage and the inherent losses of the open lossy resonator. The perfect compensation of these two elements is known as the critical coupling condition and can be easily tuned by the geometry of the resonator. On the one hand, the scattering in the reflection problem is represented by the reflection coefficient. A single symmetry of the resonance is used to obtain the critical coupling condition. Therefore the perfect absorption can be obtained in this case. On the other hand, the transmission problem is represented by two eigenvalues of the scattering matrix, representing the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the full scattering problem. In the geometry analyzed in this work, only one kind of symmetry can be critically coupled, and therefore, the maximal absorption in the transmission problem is limited to 0.5. The results shown in this work pave the way to the design of resonators for efficient flexural wave absorption."

We propose an approach that enables deep reinforcement learning to train policies that are gentle, both during exploration and task execution. In a reward-based learning environment, a natural approach involves augmenting the (task) reward with a penalty for non-gentleness, which can be defined as excessive impact force. However, augmenting with only this penalty impairs learning: policies get stuck in a local optimum which avoids all contact with the environment. Prior research has shown that combining auxiliary tasks or intrinsic rewards can be beneficial for stabilizing and accelerating learning in sparse-reward domains, and indeed we find that introducing a surprise-based intrinsic reward does avoid the no-contact failure case. However, we show that a simple dynamics-based surprise is not as effective as penalty-based surprise. Penalty-based surprise, based on predicting forceful contacts, has a further benefit: it encourages exploration which is contact-rich yet gentle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a complex, tendon-powered robot hand with tactile sensors. Videos are available at http://sites.google.com/view/gentlemanipulation."

The currently best known upper bound on this problem is not primitive-recursive, even when considering systems of fixed dimension. We provide significant refinements to the classical decomposition algorithm of Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert and to its termination proof, which yield an ACKERMANN upper bound in the general case, and primitive-recursive upper bounds in fixed dimension.

Energy harvesting (EH) is a promising means for realizing sustainable lifelogging. However, present EH technologies suffer from instability of the generated electricity caused by changes of environment, e.g., the output of a solar cell varies based on its material, light intensity, and light wavelength. In this paper, we leverage this instability of EH technologies for other purposes, in addition to its use as an energy source. Specifically, we propose to determine the variation of generated electricity as a sensor for recognizing ""places"" where the user visits, which is important information in the lifelogging system. First, we investigate the amount of generated electricity of selected energy harvesting elements in various environments. Second, we design a system called EHAAS (Energy Harvesters As A Sensor) where energy harvesting elements are used as a sensor. With EHAAS, we propose a place recognition method based on machine-learning and implement a prototype wearable system. Our prototype evaluation confirms that EHAAS achieves a place recognition accuracy of 88.5% F-value for nine different indoor and outdoor places. This result is better than the results of existing sensors (3-axis accelerometer and brightness). We also clarify that only two types of solar cells are required for recognizing a place with 86.2% accuracy."

We find that pushing modes are unstable and moreover, that the dynamics of the air-fluid front involves a host of transient finger shapes over a significant range of experimental parameters."

In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated in both simulations and experiments."

Moreover, we show how to avoid a degeneracy of zero photometric gradients via rasterizing from a virtual viewpoint. We demonstrate 3D object mesh reconstruction results from both synthetic and real-world videos with our photometric mesh optimization, which is unachievable with either na\""ive mesh generation networks or traditional pipelines of surface reconstruction without heavy manual post-processing."

In part, this can be attributed to their reliance upon cheap, low-feature size, COTS components originally designed for embedded and mobile-market applications, for which traditional hardware-voting concepts are ineffective. Software-fault-tolerance concepts have been shown effective for such systems, but have largely been ignored by the space industry due to low maturity, as most have only been researched in theory. In practice, designers of payload instruments and miniaturized satellites are usually forced to sacrifice reliability in favor deliver the level of performance necessary for cutting-edge science and innovative commercial applications. Thus, we developed a software-fault-tolerance-approach based upon thread-level coarse-grain lockstep, which was validated using fault-injection. To offer strong long-term fault coverage, our architecture is implemented as tiled MPSoC on an FPGA, utilizing partial reconfiguration, as well as mixed criticality. This architecture can satisfy the high performance requirements of current and future scientific and commercial space missions at very low cost, while offering the strong fault-coverage guarantees necessary for platform control even for missions with a long duration. This architecture was developed for a 4-year ESA project. Together with two industrial partners, we are developing a prototype to then undergo radiation testing."

By applying Cartan's equivalence method to a suitable differential system on the universal family of the Douady space of the complex manifold, we prove that this conjecture is true if $A$ is a Fano manifold, or if the global sections of $W$ separate points of $A$. Our method shows more generally that for any unobstructed compact submanifold $A$ in a complex manifold, if the normal bundle is globally generated and its sections separate points of $A$, then a sufficiently general deformation of $A$ satisfies the formal principle. In particular, a sufficiently general smooth free rational curve on a complex manifold satisfies the formal principle."

The problem of semantic segmentation in dynamic scenes has begun to recently receive attention with video object segmentation approaches. What is not known is how much extra information the temporal dynamics of the visual scene carries that is complimentary to the information available in the individual frames of the video. There is evidence that the human visual system can effectively perceive the scene from temporal dynamics information of the scene's changing visual characteristics without relying on the visual characteristics of individual snapshots themselves. Our work takes steps to explore whether machine perception can exhibit similar properties by combining appearance-based representations and temporal dynamics representations in a joint-learning problem that reveals the contribution of each toward successful dynamic scene segmentation. Additionally, we provide the MIT Driving Scene Segmentation dataset, which is a large-scale full driving scene segmentation dataset, densely annotated for every pixel and every one of 5,000 video frames. This dataset is intended to help further the exploration of the value of temporal dynamics information for semantic segmentation in video."

Based on the rest frame defined by the \oiii $\lambda$5007 narrow emission line, a medium-strong positive correlation is found between the \civ\ blueshift and the luminosity at 5100\AA\ or the Eddington ratio \leddR. A medium-strong negative relationship is found between the \civ\ blueshift and \civ\ equivalent width. These results support the postulation where the radiation pressure may be the driver of \civ\ blueshift. There is a medium strong correlation between the mass ratio of \civ-based to $\hb$-based \mbh and the \civ\ blueshift, which indicates that the bias for \civ-based \mbh is affected by the \civ\ profile."

However C i lines, one of the main abundance diagnostics, are sensitive to departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We present a model atom for non-LTE analyses of C i lines, that uses a new, physically-motivated recipe for the rates of neutral hydrogen impact excitation. We analyse C i lines in the solar spectrum, employing a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model solar atmosphere and 3D non-LTE radiative transfer. We find negative non-LTE abundance corrections for C i lines in the solar photosphere, in accordance with previous studies, reaching up to around 0.1 dex in the disk-integrated flux. We also present the first fully consistent 3D non-LTE solar carbon abundance determination: we infer log $\epsilon_{\text{C}}$ = $8.44\pm0.02$, in good agreement with the current standard value. Our models reproduce the observed solar centre-to-limb variations of various C i lines, without any adjustments to the rates of neutral hydrogen impact excitation, suggesting that the proposed recipe may be a solution to the long-standing problem of how to reliably model inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen in late-type stellar atmospheres."

The stellar stream was detected using the SDSS Data Release 14 by means of a matched filter in the color--magnitude diagram that is optimised for a stellar population that is 8 Gyr old with [Fe/H] = $-$0.46 dex, and located at heliocentric distance of 18 kpc. The candidate stream is faint (turnoff point at $r_0 \sim$ 19.6), sparse and barely visible in SDSS photometry. It is also detected in the (shallower) Pan-STARRs data. The residual stellar density in the $(u-g)_0$, $(g-r)_0$ color--color diagram gives the same estimate for the age and [Fe/H] of this stellar population. The stream is located at a Galactic coordinates $(l,b) = (79.4,-24.6)$ and extends over 9$^\circ$ (2.5 kpc), with a width of 112 pc. The narrow width suggests a globular cluster progenitor."

We prove two different subordination principles for such operators. One concerns affine symbols only, and is based on an arithmetical condition on the coefficients of $\varphi$. The other concerns general symbols, and is based on a geometrical condition on the boundary values of $\varphi$. Both principles are strict, in the sense that they characterize the composition operators of maximal norm generated by symbols having given mapping properties. In particular, we generalize a result of J. H. Shapiro on the norm of composition operators on the classical Hardy space of the unit disc. Based on our techniques, we also improve the recently established upper and lower norm bounds in the special case that $\varphi(s) = c + r2^{-s}$. A number of other examples are given."

Here, the electromagnetic properties of superconducting electric machines with bulk HTS trapped-field magnets in the rotor and conventional copper coils in the stator are investigated. To this end, an analytical model of the electromagnetic field in radial air-gap synchronous electric machines is developed and validated, taking into account the specific difficulties that occur in the treatment of machines with bulk HTS. Using this model, the influence of pole pair number, stator winding thickness, rotor surface coverage, and air gap width on the machine's Esson coefficient is calculated. In contrast to numerical simulations, the method presented here can provide results within minutes, making it particularly useful for work in early development and systems engineering, where large parameter spaces must be investigated quickly."

At zero field, a spontaneous spin canting of $\varphi = 7(1)^{\circ}$ is found. The spins tilt away from the easy $b$-axis toward $c$. Symmetry considerations lead to the magnetic point group $m'_z$, which is consistent with the previously observed magnetoelectric tensor form and weak ferromagnetic moment along $b$. For magnetic fields applied along $a$, the induced ferromagnetic moment couples via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to yield an additional field-induced spin canting. An upper limit to the size of the interaction is estimated from the canting angle."

Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) hold a great potential to work as on-chip micro-power sources and energy storage units complementing batteries and energy harvester systems. The scalable production of supercapacitor materials with cost-effective and high-throughput processing methods is crucial for the widespread application of MSCs. Here, we report wet-jet milling exfoliation of graphite to scale-up the production of graphene as supercapacitor material. The formulation of aqueous/alcohol-based graphene inks allows metal-free, flexible MSCs to be screen-printed. These MSCs exhibit areal capacitance (Careal) values up to 1.324 mF cm-2 (5.296 mF cm-2 for a single electrode), corresponding to an outstanding volumetric capacitance (Cvol) of 0.490 F cm-3 (1.961 F cm-3 for a single electrode). The screen-printed MSCs can operate up to power density above 20 mW cm-2 at energy density of 0.064 uWh cm-2. The devices exhibit excellent cycling stability over charge-discharge cycling (10000 cycles), bending cycling (100 cycles at bending radius of 1 cm) and folding (up to angles of 180{\deg}). Moreover, ethylene vinyl acetate-encapsulated MSCs retain their electrochemical properties after a home-laundry cycle, providing waterproof and washable properties for prospective application in wearable electronics."

Our model is different from the so-called $3+n$ model with $n$ sterile neutrinos suggested to interpret short baseline anomalies in terms of neutrino oscillations. While the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in $3+n$ model is simply extended to $n\times n$ unitary matrix, the neutrino mixing matrix in our model is parameterized so as to keep the $3\times3$ PMNS mixing matrix for three active neutrinos unitary. There are also no flavor changing neutral current interactions leading to the conversion of active neutrinos to sterile ones or vice versa. We derive new forms of neutrino oscillation probabilities containing the new interference between the active and sterile neutrinos which are characterized by additional new parameters $\Delta m^2$ and $\theta$. Based on the new formulae derived, we show how the short baseline neutrino anomalies can be explained in terms of oscillations, and study the implication of the high energy neutrino events detected at IceCube on the probe of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. New phenomenological effects attributed to the existence of the sterile neutrinos are discussed."

This will be one of the deepest exposures of the sky ever taken, reaching a photon-noise photometric precision of 0.01 mag per exposure and collecting a total of $\sim 10^9$ photons over the course of the survey for a W149$_{\rm AB}\sim 21$ star. Of order $4 \times 10^7$ stars will be monitored with W149$_{\rm AB}$<21, and 10$^8$ stars with W145$_{\rm AB}$<23.

It will be sensitive to (effectively) isolated compact objects with masses as low as the mass of Pluto, thereby enabling a measurement of the compact object mass function over 10 orders of magnitude. Assuming photon-noise limited precision, it will detect $\sim 10^5$ transiting planets with sizes as small as $\sim 2~R_\oplus$, perform asteroseismology of $\sim 10^6$ giant stars, measure the proper motions to $\sim 0.3\%$ and parallaxes to $\sim 10\%$ for the $\sim 6 \times 10^6$ disk and bulge stars in the survey area, and directly detect $\sim 5 \times 10^3$ Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with diameters down to $\sim 10$ km, as well as detect $\sim 10^3$ occulations of stars by TNOs during the survey. All of this science will completely serendipitous, i.e., it will not require modifications of the WFIRST optimal microlensing survey design. Allowing for some minor deviation from the optimal design, such as monitoring the Galactic center, would enable an even broader range of transformational science."

We do so by observing that when genuine coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws', in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation can be described in the quantum formalism by considering the presence of entanglement not only at the level of the states, but also at the level of the measurements. However, at the ""local'"" level of a specific joint measurement, a description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always possible, by adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But contextual tensor product representations should only be considered when there are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled) product states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will have to generally be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In view of the numerous violations of the marginal laws observed in physics' laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in micro-physical systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as an 'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be entangled, the corresponding violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal communication would be possible."

The direct numerical simulations of irregular wave ensembles are performed to obtain the complete accurate data on the rogue wave occurrence and evolution. The simulations are conducted by means of the HOS scheme for the potential Euler equations; purely collinear wave systems, moderately crested and short-crested sea states have been simulated. We join instant abnormally high waves in close locations and close time moments to new objects, rogue events, what helps to retrieve the abnormal occurrences more stably and more consistently from the physical point of view. The rogue wave event probability distributions are built based on the simulated wave data. They show the distinctive difference between rough sea states with small directional bandwidth on the one part, and small-amplitude states and short-crested states on the other part. The former support long-living rogue wave patterns (the corresponding probability distributions have heavy tails), though the latter possess exponential probability distributions of rogue event lifetimes and produce much shorter rogue wave events."

However, magneto-optical imaging does not automatically return two-dimensional maps with the actual values of the magnetic field, due to the non-linear response functions of magneto-optical indicator films and in practice also non-uniform illumination. A quantitative treatment is needed in order to achieve such a calibration. After calibration, one can proceed to deduce the corresponding two-dimensional maps of the current density distribution from inversion of the Biot-Savart law. While there has been published a large amount of work on quantitative magneto-optical imaging, the material is scattered and notation differs significantly between different authors. These notes originate from parts of the Ph. D. thesis of the author and collect the most important materials into a unified and updated treatment. Basic aspects of magnetic flux penetration in superconductors including the Bean model are reviewed briefly in chapter 1. In chapter 2, the method of magneto-optical imaging using the Faraday effect is introduced, together with practical aspects of magneto-optical experiments at low temperatures and the semi-qualitative technique of RGB addition for checking the reproducibility of flux patterns. The physics of magneto-optical indicator films and calibration of magneto-optical images into maps of magnetic field values are discussed in chapter 3. Next, in chapter 4 the Biot-Savart law and fast Fourier transformations are discussed before proceeding to inversion of magnetic field maps into current density maps. Finally, magnetometry with Faraday magneto-optical imaging is treated. MATLAB codes for several of the discussed concepts can be found at https://github.com/atlejq/Magneto-optics"

Motivated by this fact, we introduce the notions of reiterative distributional chaos of types $1$, $1^+$ and $2$ for continuous linear operators on Banach spaces, which are characterized in terms of the existence of an irregular vector with additional properties. Moreover, we study its relations with other dynamical properties and give conditions for the existence of a vector subspace $Y$ of $X$ such that every non-zero vector in $Y$ is both irregular for $T$ and distributionally near to zero for $T.$"

A key challenge to a modular design approach is the certification of robust stability under uncertainties in the rest of the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying the parametric region, which guarantees stability of the connected module in the robust sense under uncertainties. We derive the conditions under which the robust stability of the connected module is guaranteed for some values of the design parameters, and present a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization-based algorithm to identify such a parametric region for polynomial systems. Using the example of an inverter-based microgrid, we show how this parametric region changes with variations in the level of uncertainties in the network."

Evidence against the   proposed planet Aldebaran b,"Radial-velocity variations of the K giant star Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau) were first reported in the early 1990s. After subsequent analyses, the radial-velocity variability with a period of $\sim 629\,\mathrm{d}$ has recently been interpreted as caused by a planet of several Jovian masses. We want to further investigate the hypothesis of an extrasolar planet around Aldebaran. We combine 165 new radial-velocity measurements from Lick Observatory with seven already published data sets comprising 373 radial-velocity measurements. We perform statistical analyses and investigate whether a Keplerian model properly fits the radial velocities. We also perform a dynamical stability analysis for a possible two-planet solution. As best Keplerian fit to the combined radial-velocity data we obtain an orbit for the hypothetical planet with a smaller period ($P=607\,\mathrm{d}$) and a larger eccentricity ($e=0.33 \pm 0.04$) than the previously proposed one. However, the residual scatter around that fit is still large, with a standard deviation of $117\,\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. In 2006/2007, the statistical power of the $\sim 620\,\mathrm{d}$ period showed a temporary but significant decrease. Plotting the growth of power in reverse chronological order reveals that a period around $620\,\mathrm{d}$ is clearly present in the newest data but not in the data taken before $\sim$ 2006. Furthermore, an apparent phase shift between radial-velocity data and orbital solution is observable at certain times. A two-planet Keplerian fit matches the data considerably better than a single-planet solution, but poses severe dynamical stability issues. The radial-velocity data from Lick Observatory do not further support but in fact weaken the hypothesis of a substellar companion around Aldebaran. Oscillatory convective modes might be a plausible alternative explanation of the observed radial-velocity variations."

Multi-object and high resolution integral-field spectroscopy have started to measure these distributions across hundreds of HII regions individually resolved at $\lesssim 100$ pc scales in a handful of objects, but in the coming decade these studies will expand to larger samples of galaxies. This will allow us to understand the role of feedback and turbulence in driving the mixing and diffusion of metals in the ISM, and statistically assess the role of galaxy environment and disk dynamics in modifying how mixing proceeds. Detailed searches for over- and under-enriched regions can address to what extent star formation is triggered by previous generations of star formation and by pristine and recycled gas flows. Local galaxies, for which these detailed measurements will be possible within the next decade, will inform the interpretation of integrated measurements at high-z, where very different dynamical gas-rich environments are found in early disk galaxies. Currently, progress in the field is severely hampered by the 0.2-0.3 dex level systematic uncertainties plaguing nebular abundance diagnostics. Improving our detailed understanding of ionized nebulae at $<$20 pc scales will help us find a solution to this problem, which will prove key to the study of metal enrichment and mixing across the galaxy population in the next decade."

The primary tool for our analysis is commutation relations between the subsystem matrices. Our stability conditions are robust with respect to small perturbations in the elements of these matrices.

Such insights would help the community to get an estimate of the downstream task performance, as well as to design more informed neural architectures, while avoiding extensive experimentation which requires substantial computational resources not all researchers have access to. A recent development in NLP is to use simple classification tasks, also called probing tasks, that test for a single linguistic feature such as part-of-speech. Existing studies mostly focus on exploring the linguistic information encoded by the continuous representations of English text. However, from a typological perspective the morphologically poor English is rather an outlier: the information encoded by the word order and function words in English is often stored on a morphological level in other languages. To address this, we introduce 15 type-level probing tasks such as case marking, possession, word length, morphological tag count and pseudoword identification for 24 languages. We present a reusable methodology for creation and evaluation of such tests in a multilingual setting. We then present experiments on several diverse multilingual word embedding models, in which we relate the probing task performance for a diverse set of languages to a range of five classic NLP tasks: POS-tagging, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, named entity recognition and natural language inference. We find that a number of probing tests have significantly high positive correlation to the downstream tasks, especially for morphologically rich languages. We show that our tests can be used to explore word embeddings or black-box neural models for linguistic cues in a multilingual setting."

Our optimization-based model decomposes wholesale supply and demand curves into buy and sell orders of individual market participants. In doing so, the model detects and removes arbitrage orders. As a result, we construct an innovative fundamental model of a wholesale electricity market. First, our fundamental demand curve has a unique composition. The demand curve lies in between the wholesale demand curve and a perfectly inelastic demand curve. Second, our fundamental supply and demand curves contain only actual (i.e. non-arbitrage) transactions with physical assets on buy and sell sides. Third, these transactions are designated to one of the three groups of wholesale electricity market participants: retailers, suppliers, or utility companies. To evaluate the performance of our model, we use the German wholesale market data. Our fundamental model yields a more precise approximation of the actual load values than a model with perfectly inelastic demand. Moreover, we conduct a study of wholesale demand elasticities. The obtained conclusions regarding wholesale demand elasticity are consistent with the existing academic literature."

In the present work, we study the influence of supercooling on the structure and morphology of the crystalline nuclei arising and growing within a liquid metallic film. The cluster analysis allows us to compute the diffraction patterns and to evaluate the morphological characteristics (the linear sizes of the homogeneous part and the thickness of the surface layer) of the crystalline nuclei emergent in the system at different levels of supercooling. We find that the liquid metallic film at the temperatures corresponded to low supercooling levels crystallizes into a monocrystal, whereas a polycrystalline structure forms at deep supercooling levels. We find that the temperature dependence of critical size of the crystalline nuclei contains two distinguishable regimes with the crossover temperature $T/T_{g}\approx1.15$ ($T_{g}$ is the glass transition temperature), which appears due to the specific geometry of the system."

At the current, pilot stage of the AMoRE project we employ six calcium molybdate crystals with a total mass of 1.9 kg, produced from $^{48}$Ca-depleted calcium and $^{100}$Mo-enriched molybdenum ($^{48\textrm{depl}}$Ca$^{100}$MoO$_4$). The simultaneous detection of heat(phonon) and scintillation (photon) signals is realized with high resolution metallic magnetic calorimeter sensors that operate at milli-Kelvin temperatures. This stage of the project is carried out in the Yangyang underground laboratory at a depth of 700 m. We report first results from the AMoRE-Pilot $0\nu\beta\beta$ search with a 111 kg$\cdot$d live exposure of $^{48\textrm{depl}}$Ca$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals. No evidence for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo is found, and a upper limit is set for the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{100}$Mo of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 9.5\times10^{22}$ y at 90% C.L.. This limit corresponds to an effective Majorana neutrino mass limit in the range $\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle\le(1.2-2.1)$ eV."

We study the force estimation in the steady-state regime where the information of the force is extracted by measuring observable of the oscillator such as quadrature and mean phonon excitation. We quantify the force sensitivity in terms of quantum Fisher information and show that it diverges approaching the critical spin-boson coupling making the system sensitive to very small force perturbation. We show that close to the critical coupling the measurement of the oscillator quadrature is optimal in a sense that saturates the fundamental Cramer-Rao bound. Furthermore, we study the force estimation in the presence of phonon squeezing and show that it can significantly improve the sensitivity reaching minimal detectable force of order of xN (1${\rm xN=10^{-27}{\rm N}}$)."

Global fits to the data are performed under different propagation and hadronic interaction models. The uncertainties from the injection spectrum, propagation effects and solar modulation of the cosmic rays are taken into account comprehensively. Since we need to investigate extended parameter regions with multiple free parameters in the fit, the machine learning method is adopted to maintain a realistic time cost. We find all the effects considered in the fitting process interplay with each other, among which the hadronic interaction model is the most important factor affecting the result. In most hadronic interaction and CR propagation models no DM signal is found with significance larger than $2\sigma$ except that the EPOS-LHC interaction model requires a more than $3\sigma$ DM signal with DM mass around $1\,\mathrm{TeV}$. For the diffusive reacceleration propagation model there is a highly significant DM signal with mass around $100\,\mathrm{GeV}$. However, the signal becomes less than $1\sigma$ if we take a charge dependent solar modulation potential in the analysis."

Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) is an effective algorithm for learning approximate Nash equilibrium of imperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain knowledge. However, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to converge in online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approach approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep search depth. In this paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play (MC-NFSP), an algorithm combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, which greatly improves the performance on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-information games. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play can converge to approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious Self Play can't. Furthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play (ANFSP). It use asynchronous and parallel architecture to collect game experience. In experiments, we show that parallel actor-learners have a further accelerated and stabilizing effect on training."

Our analysis, updating Refs. [1,2] and including these new data, suggests the presence of right-handed couplings encoded in the Wilson coefficients ${\cal C}_{9'\mu}$ and ${\cal C}_{10'\mu}$. It also strengthens our earlier observation that a lepton flavour universality violating (LFUV) left-handed lepton coupling (${\cal C}_{9\mu}^{\rm V}=-{\cal C}_{10\mu}^{\rm V}$), often preferred from the model building point of view, accommodates the data better if lepton-flavour universal (LFU) NP is allowed, in particular in ${\cal C}_{9}^{\rm U}$. Furthermore, this scenario with LFU NP provides a simple and model-independent connection to the $b\to c\tau \nu$ anomalies, showing a preference of $\approx 7\,\sigma$ with respect to the SM. It may also explain why fits to the whole set of $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data or to the subset of LFUV data exhibit stronger preferences for different NP scenarios. Finally, motivated by $Z^\prime$ models with vector-like quarks, we propose four new scenarios with LFU and LFUV NP contributions that give a very good fit to data. We provide also an addendum collecting our updated results after including the data for the $B\to K^*\mu\mu$ angular distribution released in 2020 by the LHCb collaboration."

The crucial criterion is that the dissipation at the end of the reheating phase must be primarily driven by perturbative decays. When reheating is primarily driven by interactions that are linear in the inflaton field, then this is possible if the coupling constant is, roughly speaking, smaller than the ratio between the inflaton mass and the Planck mass. For interactions involving higher powers of the inflaton field the range of observationally accessible parameter values is generally smaller. The size of the inflaton coupling is not only interesting for particle physics model building, but crucially shapes the evolution of the cosmos by setting the initial condition for the hot big bang when reheating the universe."

While the evaluation component is vital, the accuracy of move value estimates is also fundamentally linked to how well the sampling distribution corresponds the true distribution. Despite this, recent work in trick-taking card game AI has mainly focused on improving evaluation algorithms with limited work on improving sampling. In this paper, we focus on the effect of sampling on the strength of a player and propose a novel method of sampling more realistic states given move history. In particular, we use predictions about locations of individual cards made by a deep neural network --- trained on data from human gameplay - in order to sample likely worlds for evaluation. This technique, used in conjunction with Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search, provides a substantial increase in cardplay strength in the popular trick-taking card game of Skat."

We investigate the propagation of the uncertainties into large scale clustering by exploiting all known estimators, and propose the wedge approach as a promising analysis tool to extract cosmic distance information still remaining in the photometric galaxy samples. We test our method using simulated galaxy maps with photometric uncertainties of $\sigma_{0} =\left(0.01, 0.02, 0.03\right)$. The measured anisotropy correlation function $\xi$ is binned into the radial direction of $s$ and the angular direction of $\mu$, and the variations of $\xi(s,\mu)$ with perpendicular and radial cosmic distance measures of $D_A$ and $H^{-1}$ are theoretically estimated by an improved RSD model. Although the radial cosmic distance $H^{-1}$ is unable to be probed from any of the three photometric galaxy samples, the perpendicular component of $D_A$ is verified to be accurately measured even after the full marginalisation of $H^{-1}$. We measure $D_A$ with approximately 6% precision which is nearly equivalent to what we can expect from spectroscopic DR12 CMASS galaxy samples."

In the linear optical regime, one important application field of metasurfaces is imaging by planar metalenses, which enables device miniaturization and aberration correction compared to conventional optical microlens systems. With the incorporation of nonlinear responses into passive metasurfaces, optical functionalities of metalenses are anticipated to be further enriched, leading to completely new applications areas. Here, we demonstrate imaging with nonlinear metalenses that combine the function of an ultrathin planar lens with simultaneous frequency conversion. With such nonlinear metalenses, we experimentally demonstrate imaging of objects with near infrared light while the image appears in the second harmonic signal of visible frequency range. Furthermore, the functionality of these nonlinear metalenses can be modified by switching the handedness of the circularly polarized fundamental wave, leading to either real or virtual nonlinear image formation. Nonlinear metalenses do not only enable infrared light imaging through a visible detector but also have the ability to modulate nonlinear optical responses through an ultrathin metasurface device while the fundamental wave remains unaffected, which offers the capability of nonlinear information processing with novel optoelectronic devices."

Widely used Gauss-Newton approaches are very sensitive to the initialization and often not suitable for real-time estimation. Learning approaches are very promising for real-time estimation, as they shift the computational burden to an offline training stage. Prior machine learning approaches to power system state estimation have been electrical model-agnostic, in that they did not exploit the topology and physical laws governing the power grid to design the architecture of the learning model. In this paper, we propose a novel learning model that utilizes the structure of the power grid. The proposed neural network architecture reduces the number of coefficients needed to parameterize the mapping from the measurements to the network state by exploiting the separability of the estimation problem. This prevents overfitting and reduces the complexity of the training stage. We also propose a greedy algorithm for phasor measuring units placement that aims at minimizing the complexity of the neural network required for realizing the state estimation mapping. Simulation results show superior performance of the proposed method over the Gauss-Newton approach."

With continuous-valued state and input variables, reinforcement learning algorithms must rely on function approximators to represent the value function and policy mappings. Commonly used numerical approximators, such as neural networks or basis function expansions, have two main drawbacks: they are black-box models offering no insight in the mappings learned, and they require significant trial and error tuning of their meta-parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach to constructing smooth value functions by means of symbolic regression. We introduce three off-line methods for finding value functions based on a state transition model: symbolic value iteration, symbolic policy iteration, and a direct solution of the Bellman equation. The methods are illustrated on four nonlinear control problems: velocity control under friction, one-link and two-link pendulum swing-up, and magnetic manipulation. The results show that the value functions not only yield well-performing policies, but also are compact, human-readable and mathematically tractable. This makes them potentially suitable for further analysis of the closed-loop system. A comparison with alternative approaches using neural networks shows that our method constructs well-performing value functions with substantially fewer parameters."

Building on an ideal system with only nearest-neighbour exchange interactions and a perfectly oriented field, we consider the effects of dipolar interactions and field misalignment. Our approach is special in that it relies more in the possibility to switch on and off the entropic drive towards order than in the absence of (or immunity to) a particular perturbation. It can then be applied, in principle, to other uncontrolled interactions expected to be naturally present in real {magnetic} materials. We establish the conditions under which entropic effects can be discerned from an interaction drive towards order, show how to use neutron scattering as a means to unveil this mechanism, and discuss possible materials where to test these ideas."

The series elastic actuator (SEA) provides inherent compliance, safety and further benefits. This paper aims to improve the stiffness control performance of a cable-driven SEA. Existing impedance controllers were designed within the full frequency domain, though human-robot interaction commonly falls in the low frequency range. We enhance the stiffness rendering performance under formulated constraints of passivity, actuator limitation, disturbance attenuation, noise rejection at their specific frequency ranges. Firstly, we reformulate this multiple frequency-band optimization problem into the $H_\infty$ synthesis framework. Then, the performance goals are quantitatively characterized by respective restricted frequency-domain specifications as norm bounds. Further, a structured controller is directly synthesized to satisfy all the competing performance requirements. Both simulation and experimental results showed that the produced controller enabled good interaction performance for each desired stiffness varying from 0 to 1 times of the physical spring constant. Compared with the passivity-based PID method, the proposed $H_\infty$ synthesis method achieved more accurate and robust stiffness control performance with guaranteed passivity."

This two-point coherence function is seen to have a speckled structure associated with the presence of x-ray coherence vortices and domain walls. Such cross-spectral density speckle is associated with a network of spatial pairs of points for which there is zero correlation. X-ray coherence vortices and domain walls are seen to emerge naturally as the number of coherent modes required increases. An understanding of the existence and nature of such correlation singularities enhances our ability to exploit partially coherent x-ray radiation from new or upgraded synchrotron sources, for both imaging and diffraction applications."

Although a definition of the anomaly is an unknown trend in data, in many cases some hints or samples of the anomaly class can be given in advance. Conventional methods cannot use the available anomaly data, and also do not have a robustness of noise. In this paper, we propose a novel spatially-weighted reconstruction-loss-based anomaly detection with a likelihood value from a regression model trained by all known data. The spatial weights are calculated by a region of interest generated from employing visualization of the regression model. We introduce some ways to combine with various strategies to propose a state-of-the-art method. Comparing with other methods on three different datasets, we empirically verify the proposed method performs better than the others."

Many recent methods have proposed to improve adversarial robustness by utilizing adversarial training or model distillation, which adds additional procedures to model training. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm called Guided Complement Entropy (GCE) that is capable of achieving ""adversarial defense for free,"" which involves no additional procedures in the process of improving adversarial robustness. In addition to maximizing model probabilities on the ground-truth class like cross-entropy, we neutralize its probabilities on the incorrect classes along with a ""guided"" term to balance between these two terms. We show in the experiments that our method achieves better model robustness with even better performance compared to the commonly used cross-entropy training objective. We also show that our method can be used orthogonal to adversarial training across well-known methods with noticeable robustness gain. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first one that improves model robustness without compromising performance."

We explore Twinkle's capabilities for small bodies science and find that, given Twinkle's sensitivity, pointing stability, and spectral range, the mission can observe a large number of small bodies. The sensitivity of Twinkle is calculated and compared to the flux from an object of a given visible magnitude. The number, and brightness, of asteroids and comets that enter Twinkle's field of regard is studied over three time periods of up to a decade. We find that, over a decade, several thousand asteroids enter Twinkle's field of regard with a brightness and non-sidereal rate that will allow Twinkle to characterise them at the instrumentation's native resolution with SNR > 100. Hundreds of comets can also be observed. Therefore, Twinkle offers researchers the opportunity to contribute significantly to the field of Solar System small bodies research."

In this paper, we introduce a novel DCNN approach, consisting of two stages, that is fully three-dimensional end-to-end and utilizes the state-of-the-art in object detection. First, nodule candidates are identified with a U-Net-inspired 3D Faster R-CNN trained using online hard negative mining. Second, false positive reduction is performed by 3D DCNN classifiers trained on difficult examples produced during candidate screening.

There is little information however concerning the ""randomness"" of different procedures on Elliptic Curves defined over fields of characteristic $0$. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of the sequence $\psi_m=[m]P$ and then generalize to polynomial seuences of the form $\phi_m=[p(m)]P$. We examine the behaviour of this sequence in different domains and attempt to realize for which points it is not equidistributed in $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$. We will first study the sequence in the space of Elliptic Curves $E(\mathbb{C})$ defined over the complex numbers and then reconsider our approach to tackle real valued Elliptic Curves. In the process we obtain the measure with respect to which the sequence $\psi$ is equidistributed in $E(\mathbb{R})$. In Section 4 we prove that every sequence of points $P_n=(x_n,y_n,1)$ equidistributed w.r.t. that measure is not equidistributed$\mod(1)$ with the obvious map $x_n\to\{x_n\}$.

This distribution-valued random field is extended to a QS with $N+1$ marked boundary points (MBPs) with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$. We propose the conformal welding problem for it in case of $N\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 1}$. If $N=1$, it is reduced to the problem introduced by Sheffield, who solved it by coupling the QS with the Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE). When $N \ge 3$, there naturally appears a room of making the configuration of MBPs random, and hence a new problem arises how to determine the probability law of the configuration. We report that the multiple SLE in $\mathbb{H}$ driven by the Dyson model on $\mathbb{R}$ helps us to fix the problems and makes them solvable for any $N \ge 3$.   We also propose the flow line problem for an imaginary surface with boundary condition changing points (BCCPs). In the case when the number of BCCPs is two, this problem was solved by Miller and Sheffield. We address the general case with an arbitrary number of BCCPs in a similar manner to the conformal welding problem. We again find that the multiple SLE driven by the Dyson model plays a key role to solve the flow line problem."

In the case of a positive vortex pair, which is of interest for physical experimental applications, a new bifurcation diagram is obtained, for which the bifurcation of four tori into one is indicated. The presence of bifurcations of three and four tori in the integrable model of vortex dynamics with positive intensities indicates a complex transition and the connection of bifurcation diagrams of both limit cases. Analytical results of this publication (the bifurcation diagram, the reduction to a system with one degree of freedom, the stability analysis) form the basis of computer simulation of absolute dynamics of vortices in a fixed coordinate system in the case of arbitrary values of the physical parameters of the model (the intensities, the vortex interaction and etc.)"

They have been observed during H/He-triggered (Type I) bursts and Carbon-triggered superbursts. The mechanism responsible is not unknown, but the dominant burst oscillation frequency is typically within a few Hz of the spin frequency, where this is independently known. One of the best-studied burst oscillation sources, 4U 1636-536, has oscillations at $581\,\text{Hz}$ in both its regular Type I bursts and in one superburst. Recently however, Strohmayer \& Mahmoodifar reported the discovery of an additional signal at a higher frequency, $835\,\text{Hz}$, during the superburst. This higher frequency is consistent with the predictions for several types of global ocean mode, one of the possible burst oscillation mechanisms. If this is the case then the same physical mechanism may operate in the normal Type I bursts of this source. In this paper we report a stacked search for periodic signals in the regular Type I bursts: we found no significant signal at the higher frequency, with upper limits for the single trial root mean square (rms) fractional amplitude of 0.57(6)\%. Our analysis did however reveal that the dominant $581\,\text{Hz}$ burst oscillation signal is present at a weak level even in the sample of bursts where it cannot be detected in individual bursts. This indicates that any cutoff in the burst oscillation mechanism occurs below the detection threshold of existing X-ray telescopes."

More than 30% are classified as either unidentified/unassociated Gamma-ray sources (UGSs), with about 20% classified as Blazar candidates of uncertain types (BCUs). To confirm the blazar-like nature of candidate counterparts of UGSs and BCUs, we started in 2012 an optical spectroscopic follow up campaign. We report here the spectra of 36 targets with observations from the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir, the Southern Astrophysical Research Observatory, the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Northern Optical Telescope, between 2016 and 2017. We confirm the BL Lac nature of 23 sources, and the flat spectrum radio quasar nature of other 7 ones. We also provide redshift estimates for 19 out of these 30 confirmations, with only one being a lower limit due to spectral features ascribable to intervening systems along the line of sight. As in previous analyses, the largest fraction of now-classified BCUs belong to the class of BL Lac objects, that appear to be the most elusive class of active galactic nuclei. One of the BL Lacs identified in this work, associated with 3FGL J2213.6-4755, lies at a redshift of $z>$1.529, making it one of the few distant gamma-ray BL Lac objects."

Medical doctors typically base the diagnosis of ARI on patients' symptoms alone and do not always conduct virological tests necessary to identify individual viruses, which limits the ability to study the interaction between multiple pathogens and make public health recommendations. We consider a stochastic kinetic model (SKM) for two interacting ARI pathogens circulating in a large population and an empirically motivated background process for infections with other pathogens causing similar symptoms. An extended marginal sampling approach based on the Linear Noise Approximation to the SKM integrates multiple data sources and additional model components. We infer the parameters defining the pathogens' dynamics and interaction within a Bayesian hierarchical model and explore the posterior trajectories of infections for each illness based on aggregate infection reports from six epidemic seasons collected by the state health department, and a subset of virological tests from a sentinel program at a general hospital in San Luis Potos\'i, M\'exico. We interpret the results based on real and simulated data and make recommendations for future data collection strategies. Supplementary materials and software are provided online."

Although efficient concurrent linked-list algorithms are well known, it can be difficult to adapt these approaches to build a high-performance adjacency list. Furthermore, it can often be desirable to execute operations in these data structures transactionally, or perform a sequence of operations in one atomic step. In this paper, we present a lock-free transactional adjacency list based on a multi-dimensional list (MDList). We are able to combine known linked list strategies with the capability of the MDList in order to efficiently organize graph vertexes and their edges. We design our underlying data structure to be node-based and linearizable, then use the Lock-Free Transactional Transformation (LFTT) methodology to efficiently enable transactional execution. In our performance evaluation, our lock-free transactional adjacency list achieves an average of 50% speedup over a transactional boosting implementation."

One barrier is our limited formats, such as IUPAC, for abstractly describing macromolecules. To overcome this barrier, we developed BpForms and BcForms, a toolkit of ontologies, grammars, and software for abstracting the primary structure of polymers and complexes as combinations of residues, caps, crosslinks, and nicks. The toolkit can help quality control, exchange, and integrate information about the primary structure of macromolecules into fine-grained global networks of intracellular biochemistry."

A significant property of such a rotational flow at high Reynolds numbers is that mixing in its core is slower than wall-adjacent areas and corner eddies. We explain this property by considering the resonance between frequencies of unsteady motion -- captured by the Koopman spectral analysis of the velocity field -- and the circulation frequency of Lagrangian tracers in the mean flow. In high-Reynolds rotational 2D flows, the vorticity in the rotational core is uniformly distributed, which leads to uniform distribution of circulation periods in the mean flow, i.e., the kinematics in the core of mean flow is like rigid-body rotation. When this ``rigid"" core is exposed to velocity fluctuations arising from bifurcations at high Reynolds, it shows more resilience toward resonance in Lagrangian motion and hence mixes more slowly compared to other areas. We also show how our qualitative resonance argument extends to chaotic flows where the classical tools of dynamical systems are not applicable."

Considering that the magnetic field strength of pulsars ranges from about $10^8$ to $10^{15}$ G, one could expect quantum electrodynamics (QED) to play a role in their spin-down, especially for strongly magnetized ones (magnetars). In fact several authors have argued that QED corrections will dominate the spin-down for slowly rotating stars. They called this effect quantum vacuum friction (QVF). However, QVF was originally derived using a problematic self-torque technique, which leads to a dramatic overestimation of this spin-down effect. Here, instead of using QVF, we explicitly calculate the energy loss from rotating neutron stars using the Poynting vector and a model for a particle wind, and we include the QED one-loop corrections. We express the excess emission as QED one-loop corrections to the radiative magnetic moment of a neutron star. We do find a small component of the spin-down luminosity that originates from the vacuum polarization. However, it never exceeds one percent of the classical magnetic dipole radiation in neutron stars for all physically interesting field strengths. Therefore, we find that the radiative corrections of QED are irrelevant in the energetics of neutron-star spin-down."

In the case where the inhibitor's response to the activator's growth is rather weak, then the shadow system of the Gierer-Meinhardt model is reduced to a single though non-local equation whose dynamics is thoroughly investigated throughout the manuscript. The main focus is on the derivation of blow-up results for this non-local equation, which can be interpreted as instability patterns of the shadow system. In particular, a {\it diffusion-driven instability (DDI)}, or {\it Turing instability}, in the neighbourhood of a constant stationary solution, which then is destabilised via diffusion-driven blow-up, is observed. The latter indicates the formation of some unstable patterns, whilst some stability results of global-in-time solutions towards non-constant steady states guarantee the occurrence of some stable patterns. Most of the derived results are confirmed numerically and also compared with the ones in the case of a stationary domain."

Although mitigated, such issues still linger when using strictly small time steps and unconditionally stable fully implicit schemes. The price that comes with restricting time steps to small scales is the enormous computational load, especially in large-scale models. To address this problem, we introduce a sequential local mesh refinement framework to optimize convergence rate and prevent convergence failure, while not restricting the whole system to small time steps, thus improving computational efficiency. We test the algorithm with the non-linear two-phase flow model. Starting by solving the problem on the coarsest space-time mesh, the algorithm refines the domain in time at water saturation front to prevent convergence failure. It then deploys fine spatial grid in regions with large saturation variation to assure solution accuracy. After each refinement, the solution from the previous mesh is used to estimate the initial guess of unknowns on the current mesh for faster convergence. Numerical results are presented to confirm accuracy of our algorithm as compared to the uniformly fine time step and fine spatial discretization solution. We observe approximately 25 times speedup in the solution time by using our algorithm."

The temporal contrast with and without plasma mirror is characterized single-shot by means of self-referenced spectral interferometry with extended time excursion (SRSI-ETE) at unprecedented dynamic and temporal range. This allows for the first single-shot measurement of the plasma mirror trigger point, which is interesting for the quantitative investigation of the complex pre-plasma formation process at the surface of the target used for proton acceleration. As a demonstration of high contrast laser plasma interaction we present proton acceleration results with ultra-thin liquid crystal targets of ~ 1 $\mu$m down to 10 nm thickness. Focus scans of different target thicknesses show that highest proton energies are reached for the thinnest targets at best focus. This indicates that the contrast enhancement is effective such that the acceleration process is not limited by target pre-expansion induced by laser light preceding the main laser pulse."

First, we give the appropriate functional setting to prove the well-posedness of both models under certain assumptions on the parameters (that is, $0<\tau\leq \beta$). Second, using the energy method in the Fourier space, we obtain the optimal decay rate of a norm related to the solution both in the Fourier and the Cattaneo heat conduction models under the same assumptions on the parameters. More concretely, we prove that, when $0<\tau<\beta$, the model with heat conduction has the same decay rate as the Cauchy problem without heat conduction (see [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017]) both under the Fourier and Cattaneo heat laws. Also, we are able to see that the difference between using a Fourier or Cattaneo law in the heat conduction is not in the decay rate, but in the fact that the Cattaneo coupling exhibits the well-know regularity loss phenomenon, that is, Cattaneo model requires a higher regularity of the initial data for the solution to decay. When $0<\tau=\beta$ (that is, when the dissipation comes through the heat conduction) we still have asymptotic stability in both heat coupling models, but with a slower decay rate. As we prove later, such stability is not possible in the absence of the heat conduction. We also prove the optimality of the previous decay rates for both models by using the eigenvalues expansion method. Finally, we complete the results in [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017] by showing how the condition $0<\tau< \beta$ is not only sufficient but also necessary for the asymptotic stability of the problem without heat conduction."

Magnetic effects on the structure of   the interstellar medium,"We explore the effect of magnetic fields on the vertical distribution and multiphase structure of the supernova-driven interstellar medium (ISM) in simulations that admit dynamo action. As the magnetic field is amplified to become dynamically significant, gas becomes cooler and its distribution in the disc becomes more homogeneous. We attribute this to magnetic quenching of vertical velocity, which leads to a decrease in the cooling length of hot gas. A non-monotonic vertical distribution of the large-scale magnetic field strength, with the maximum at |z| $\approx$ 300 pc causes a downward pressure gradient below the maximum which acts against outflow driven by SN explosions, while it provides pressure support above the maximum."

In this scenario we compute the contributions of Kaluza-Klein excitations of gauge bosons and third generation quarks for the decay process $B\rightarrow X_s\ell^+\ell^-$ incorporating next-to-leading order QCD corrections. We estimate branching ratio as well as Forward Backward asymmetry associated with this decay process. Considering the constraints from some other $b \to s$ observables and electroweak precision data we show that significant amount of parameter space of this scenario has been able to explain the observed experimental data for this decay process. From our analysis we put lower limit on the size of the extra dimension by comparing our theoretical prediction for branching ratio with the corresponding experimental data. Depending on the values of free parameters of the present scenario, lower limit on the inverse of the radius of compactification ($R^{-1}$) can be as high as $\geq 760$ GeV. {Even this value could slightly be higher if we project the upcoming measurement by Belle II experiment.} Unfortunately, the Forward Backward asymmetry of this decay process would not provide any significant limit on $R^{-1}$ in the present model."

A feature of significant interest in these systems is the mean square displacement (MSD) of the particles. Long-time asymptotic approximations of the MSD have been established, via the Tauberian Theorem, for systems in which the distribution of the step durations is asymptotically a power law of infinite variance. We extend these results, using elementary analysis, and obtain closed-form expressions as well as power law bounds for the MSD in equilibrium, and representations of the MSD as sums of super-linear, linear, and sub-linear terms. We show that the super-linear components are determined by the mean and asymptotics of the step durations, but that the linear and sub-linear components (whose size has implications for the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation) depend on the entire distribution function."

In the first part we investigate the second-order properties of these varieties, obtaining results that are new also in the varifold's setting. In particular we prove that the generalized normal bundle of these varieties satisfies a natural Lusin (N) condition, which allows to extend the classical Coarea formula for the Gauss map of smooth varieties, and to introduce for all integral varifolds of bounded mean curvature a natural definition of second fundamental form, whose trace equals the generalized varifold mean curvature. In the second part, we use this machinery to extend a sharp geometric inequality of Almgren to all compact varieties of bounded mean curvature in the viscosity sense and we characterize the equality case. As a consequence we formulate sufficient conditions to conclude that the area-blow-up set is empty for sequences of varifolds whose first variation is controlled."

Following a data driven paradigm, we represent uncertainty by means of scenarios and seek a robust Nash equilibrium solution. We treat the Nash equilibrium computation problem within the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Building upon recent developments in scenario-based optimization, we accompany the computed Nash equilibrium with a priori and a posteriori probabilistic robustness certificates, providing confidence that the computed equilibrium remains unaffected (in probabilistic terms) when a new uncertainty realization is encountered. For a wide class of games, we also show that the computation of the so called compression set - a key concept in scenario-based optimization - can be directly obtained as a byproduct of the proposed solution methodology. Finally, we illustrate how to overcome differentiability issues, arising due to the introduction of scenarios, and compute a Nash equilibrium solution in a decentralized manner.

Experiments like the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and Murchison Widefield Array Phase II (MWA) feature highly-redundant antenna layouts, building sensitivity through redundant measurements of the same angular Fourier modes, at the expense of diminished UV coverage. This strategy limits the numbers of independent samples of each power spectrum mode, thereby increasing the effect of sample variance on the final power spectrum uncertainty. To better quantify this effect, we measure the sample variance of a delay-transform based power spectrum estimator, using both analytic calculations and simulations of flat-spectrum EoR-like signals. We find that for the shortest baselines in HERA, the sample variance can reach as high as 20%, and up to 30% for the wider fields-of-view of the MWA. Combining estimates from all the baselines in a HERA- or MWA-like 37 element redundant hexagonal array can lower the variance to $1-3$% for some Fourier modes. These results have important implications for observing and analysis strategies, and suggest that sample variance can be non-negligible when constraining EoR model parameters from upcoming 21cm data."

We leverage this aspect of cognition, by considering dance as a proxy for music perception, in a statistical computational model that learns semiotic correlations between music audio and dance video. We evaluate the ability of this model to effectively capture underlying semantics in a cross-modal retrieval task. Quantitative results, validated with statistical significance testing, strengthen the body of evidence for embodied cognition in music and show the model can recommend music audio for dance video queries and vice-versa."

Here we show how the expected progress in sensitivity of ground-based GW detectors over the next decade calls for U.S.-based GHz radio arrays to be improved beyond current levels. We discuss specifically how several new scientific opportunities would emerge in multi-messenger time-domain astrophysics if a next generation GHz radio facility with sensitivity and resolution $10\times$ better than the current Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) were to work in tandem with ground-based GW detectors. These opportunities include probing the properties, structure, and size of relativistic jets and wide-angle ejecta from NS-NS mergers, as well as unraveling the physics of their progenitors via host galaxy studies."

We make progress on a number of conjectures about the extremal number of bipartite graphs. First, writing $K'_{s,t}$ for the subdivision of the bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$, we show that $\mathrm{ex}(n, K'_{s,t}) = O(n^{3/2 - \frac{1}{2s}})$. This proves a conjecture of Kang, Kim and Liu and is tight up to the implied constant for $t$ sufficiently large in terms of $s$. Second, for any integers $s, k \geq 1$, we show that $\mathrm{ex}(n, L) = \Theta(n^{1 + \frac{s}{sk+1}})$ for a particular graph $L$ depending on $s$ and $k$, answering another question of Kang, Kim and Liu. This result touches upon an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits, which asserts that every rational number $r \in (1,2)$ is realisable in the sense that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H) = \Theta(n^r)$ for some appropriate graph $H$, giving infinitely many new realisable exponents and implying that $1 + 1/k$ is a limit point of realisable exponents for all $k \geq 1$. Writing $H^k$ for the $k$-subdivision of a graph $H$, this result also implies that for any bipartite graph $H$ and any $k$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H^{k-1}) = O(n^{1 + 1/k - \delta})$, partially resolving a question of Conlon and Lee. Third, extending a recent result of Conlon and Lee, we show that any bipartite graph $H$ with maximum degree $r$ on one side which does not contain $C_4$ as a subgraph satisfies $\mathrm{ex}(n, H) = o(n^{2 - 1/r})$."

High-frequency words can be sampled from the trained generative model by drawing from the joint posterior directly. We study the feasibility of the approach in two settings: (1) using simulated federated learning on a publicly available non-IID per-user dataset from a popular social networking website, (2) using federated learning on data hosted on user mobile devices. The model achieves good recall and precision compared to ground-truth OOV words in setting (1). With (2) we demonstrate the practicality of this approach by showing that we can learn meaningful OOV words with good character-level prediction accuracy and cross entropy loss."

Meanwhile, manual inspection of each case to locate the failures becomes infeasible due to the trend of large data scale and limited human resource. Therefore, we build an alarm system that will set off alerts when the segmentation result is possibly unsatisfactory, assuming no corresponding ground truth mask is provided. One plausible solution is to project the segmentation results into a low dimensional feature space; then learn classifiers/regressors to predict their qualities. Motivated by this, in this paper, we learn a feature space using the shape information which is a strong prior shared among different datasets and robust to the appearance variation of input data.The shape feature is captured using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) network that trained with only the ground truth masks. During testing, the segmentation results with bad shapes shall not fit the shape prior well, resulting in large loss values. Thus, the VAE is able to evaluate the quality of segmentation result on unseen data, without using ground truth. Finally, we learn a regressor in the one-dimensional feature space to predict the qualities of segmentation results. Our alarm system is evaluated on several recent state-of-art segmentation algorithms for 3D medical segmentation tasks. Compared with other standard quality assessment methods, our system consistently provides more reliable prediction on the qualities of segmentation results."

As a classical problem, there is always a trade-off between the complexity of deformation models and the difficulty of parameters search in image deformation. 2D cubic B-spline surface is a highly free-form deformation model and is able to handle complex deformations such as fluid image distortions. However, it is challenging to estimate an apposite global solution. To tackle this problem, we develop a genetic operation named probabilistic bitwise operation (PBO) to replace the crossover and mutation operations, which can preserve the diversity during generation iteration and achieve better coverage ratio of the solution space. Furthermore, a selection strategy named annealing selection is proposed to control the convergence. Qualitative and quantitative results on synthetic data show the effectiveness of our method."

Focusing on light, $\lesssim$ GeV mediators, we find the data favor a $\sim 10-1000$ MeV mediator as compared to the Standard Model (SM) best fit at the $\lesssim 2\sigma$ level. The best-fit coupling range is $g \sim 10^{-5}-10^{-3}$. The timing data provides statistical information on the neutrino flavor distributions that is not attainable from the nuclear recoil energies alone. This result accounts for uncertainty in the effective size of the neutron distribution, and highlights the power of including uncertainties on experimental backgrounds, nuclear structure, and BSM physics."

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been very popular for solving complex optimization problems due to its simplicity. In this work, new Artificial Human Optimization Field Algorithms are created by modifying existing PSO algorithms with AHO Field Concepts. These Hybrid PSO Algorithms comes under PSO Field as well as AHO Field. There are Hybrid PSO research articles based on Human Behavior, Human Cognition and Human Thinking etc. But there are no Hybrid PSO articles which based on concepts like Human Disease, Human Kindness and Human Relaxation. This paper proposes new AHO Field algorithms based on these research gaps. Some existing Hybrid PSO algorithms are given a new name in this work so that it will be easy for future AHO researchers to find these novel Artificial Human Optimization Field Algorithms. A total of 6 Artificial Human Optimization Field algorithms titled ""Human Safety Particle Swarm Optimization (HuSaPSO)"", ""Human Kindness Particle Swarm Optimization (HKPSO)"", ""Human Relaxation Particle Swarm Optimization (HRPSO)"", ""Multiple Strategy Human Particle Swarm Optimization (MSHPSO)"", ""Human Thinking Particle Swarm Optimization (HTPSO)"" and ""Human Disease Particle Swarm Optimization (HDPSO)"" are tested by applying these novel algorithms on Ackley, Beale, Bohachevsky, Booth and Three-Hump Camel Benchmark Functions.

As multiple modal data depict a common object from multiple perspectives, many works focus on learning the unified subspace representation. Recently, hash representation has received much attention in the retrieval field. In common Hamming space, how to directly preserve the local manifold structure among objects become an interesting problem. Most of the unsupervised hashing methods attempt to solve it by constructing a neighborhood graph on every modality respectively. However, it is hard to decide the weight factor of each graph to get the optimal graph. To overcome this problem, we adopt the concatenated features to represent the common object since the information implied by different modalities is complementary. In our framework, Locally Linear Embedding and Locality Preserving Projection are introduced to reconstruct the manifold structure of the original space. Besides, The $\ell_{2,1}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrices to explore the discriminative hashing functions. Extensive experiments are performed on three public datasets and the experimental results show that our method outperforms several classic unsupervised hashing models."

However, a main limitation of the computing paradigm is the low throughput induced by the intrinsic serial computing of bit-streams. In this paper, we address the implementation of SC in the optical domain, with the aim to improve the computation speed. We implement a generic optical architecture allowing the execution of polynomial functions. We propose design methods to explore the design space in order to optimize key metrics such as circuit robustness and power consumption. We show that a circuit implementing a 2 nd order polynomial degree function and operating at 1Ghz leads to 20.1pJ laser consumption per computed bit."

Micro-expressions are an invaluable source of information in application domains such as lie detection, mental health, sentiment analysis and more. One of the biggest challenges in this field of research is the small amount of available spontaneous micro-expression data. However, spontaneous data collection is burdened by time-consuming and expensive annotation. Hence, methods are needed which can reduce the amount of data that annotators have to review. This paper presents a novel micro-expression spotting method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on optical flow features. We extract Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF) features to encode the temporal changes in selected face regions. Finally, the RNN spots short intervals which are likely to contain occurrences of relevant facial micro-movements. The proposed method is evaluated on the SAMM database. Any chance of subject bias is eliminated by training the RNN using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. Comparing the spotted intervals with the labeled data shows that the method produced 1569 false positives while obtaining a recall of 0.4654. The initial results show that the proposed method would reduce the video length by a factor of 3.5, while still retaining almost half of the relevant micro-movements. Lastly, as the model gets more data, it becomes better at detecting intervals, which makes the proposed method suitable for supporting the annotation process."

Several photoswitchable emitters have been developed but they all fluoresce in the visible or far-red ranges, missing the desirable near-infrared window where biological tissues are most transparent. Moreover, photocontrol of individual emitters in the near-infrared would be highly desirable for elementary optical molecular switches or information storage elements since most communication data transfer protocols are established in this spectral range. Here we introduce a novel type of hybrid nanomaterials consisting of single-wall carbon nanotubes covalently functionalized with photo-switching molecules that are used to control the intrinsic luminescence of the single nanotubes in the near-infrared (beyond 1 $\mu$m). We provide proof-of-concept of localization microscopy based on these bright photoswitchable near-infrared emitters."

By addressing both tasks with the same network architectures ranging from shallow, domain-specific approaches to deep variants with directional filters, we show that axis-aligned architectures perform similarly well as common VGG-style networks developed for computer vision, while being less vulnerable to confounding factors and requiring fewer model parameters."

Thanks to the increasing precision of available observational data, we are now able to considerably constrain the geometry and composition of the Universe --- and to glimpse how these will evolve in the near future. However, this success comes at a price: one must assume the Universe ""started"" in a highly fine-tuned initial condition. Understanding what came before this is therefore one of the main goals of modern cosmology.   This thesis attempts to further our understanding of the epoch before this initial condition in three different ways.   Firstly, the concept of negative absolute temperatures (NAT) is introduced and its potential relevance for cosmology is investigated. In particular, it is shown that a Universe at a NAT should undergo a period of inflation --- although it is unclear whether this would be consistent with current observations.   Secondly, work is done on the topic of the evolution of networks of cosmic strings --- topological defects which are expected to form in a broad class of phase transitions the Universe may have gone through. A model which takes into account the presence of small-scale structure in strings is used to address questions concerning the existence and stability of scaling regimes for these networks.   Finally, it is investigated how future experiments might try to falsify a simple class of canonical single-field slow-roll inflation models by measuring the running and the running of the running of the spectral index of scalar perturbations."

To be more specific, we consider a gamma distribution as a waiting scoring model. The proposed density estimator belongs to an interesting new version of weighted beta prime distribution and outperforms the other estimator in the literature. The efficiency of our estimator is evaluated using frequentist risk along with measuring the prediction error from the old dataset, 2016-17, to the current season (2018-19) of the National Hockey League."

We show that the result can be explained within the SM without the need for any large $SU(3)$ breaking effects. It further enables the determination of the imaginary part of the ratio of the $\Delta U=0$ over $\Delta U=1$ matrix elements in charm decays, which we find to be $(0.65\pm 0.12)$. Within the standard model, the result proves the non-perturbative nature of the penguin contraction of tree operators in charm decays, similar to the known non-perturbative enhancement of $\Delta I=1/2$ over $\Delta I=3/2$ matrix elements in kaon decays, that is, the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule. As a guideline for future measurements, we show how to completely solve the most general parametrization of the $D \to P^+P^-$ system."

To improve the visual part of this difficult problem, ten preprocessing methods were tested to determine whether the widely used Union method yields the optimal results. Therefore, focusing solely on predicate prediction, no object detection and linguistic knowledge were used to prevent them from affecting the comparison results. Once fine-tuned, the Visual Geometry Group models were evaluated using Recall@1, per-predicate recall, activation maximisations, class activation maps, and error analysis. From this research it was found that using preprocessing methods such as the Union-Without-Background-and-with-Binary-mask (Union-WB-and-B) method yields significantly better results than the widely used Union method since, as designed, it enables the Convolutional Neural Network to also identify the subject and object in the convolutional layers instead of solely in the fully-connected layers."

In particular, we focus on the cases in which it is not possible to contain the entire network due to a constrained number of control signals. In this scenario, we study the problem of selecting the nodes where control signals have to be injected to maximize the number of contained nodes. Leveraging graph condensations, we find a suboptimal and computationally efficient solution to this problem, which can be implemented by solving an integer linear problem. The effectiveness of the selection strategy is illustrated through representative simulations."

Given a full-rank valuation $\mathfrak v$ on $A$ we associate weights to the coordinates of the projective space, respectively, the product of projective spaces. Let $w_{\mathfrak v}$ be the vector whose entries are these weights. Our main result is that the value semi-group of $\mathfrak v$ is generated by the images of the generators of $A$ if and only if the initial ideal of $I$ with respect to $w_{\mathfrak v}$ is prime. We further show that $w_{\mathfrak v}$ always lies in the tropicalization of $I$.   Applying our result to string valuations for flag varieties, we solve a conjecture by \cite{BLMM} connecting the Minkowski property of string cones with the tropical flag variety. For Rietsch-Williams' valuation for Grassmannians our results give a criterion for when the Pl\""ucker coordinates form a Khovanskii basis. Further, as a corollary we obtain that the weight vectors defined in \cite{BFFHL} lie in the tropical Grassmannian."

Let $A$ be an $F$-central simple algebra of even dimension so that it contains $E$ as a subfield, set $G=A^\times$ and $H$ for the centralizer of $E^\times$ in $G$. Using a Galois descent argument, we prove that all double cosets $H g H\subset G$ are stable under the anti-involution $g\mapsto g^{-1}$, reducing to Guo's result for $F$-split $G$ which we extend to fields of positive characteristic different from $2$. We then show, combining global and local results, that $H$-distinguished irreducible representations of $G$ are self-dual and this implies that $(G,H)$ is a Gelfand pair: \[dim_{\mathbb{C}}(Hom_{H}(\pi,\mathbb{C}))\leq 1\] for all smooth irreducible representations $\pi$ of $G$. Finally we explain how to obtain the the multiplicity one statement in the archimedean case using the criteria of Aizenbud and Gourevitch, and we then show self-duality of irreducible distinguished representations in the archimedean case too."

Small telescopes can readily capture exoplanet transits under good weather conditions when the combination of a bright star and a large transiting exoplanet results in a significant depth of transit. However, in reality there are many considerations that need to be made in order to obtain useful measurements. This paper and accompanying website layout a procedure based on time series differential photometry that has been successfully employed using 0.4m aperture telescopes to predict the expected precision for a whole light curve. This enables robust planning to decide whether the observation of a particular exoplanet transit should be attempted and in particular to be able to readily see when it should not to be attempted. This may result in a significant increase in the number of transit observations captured by non-specialists. The technique and website are also appropriate for planning a variety of variable star observations where a prediction of the light curve can be made."

We find that, in case (a), there is energy equipartition between the magnetic and velocity fields, whereas, in case (b), such equipartition does not exist.

For the class of equations considered in this paper, the viscosity solution of the HJB equation is equivalent to the value function of a corresponding optimal control problem. In this work, we extend the optimal control problem given on the surface to an equivalent one defined in a sufficiently thin narrow band of the co-dimensional one surface. The extension is done appropriately so that the corresponding HJB equation, in the narrow band, has a unique viscosity solution which is identical to the constant normal extension of the value function of the original optimal control problem. With this framework, one can easily use existing (high order) numerical methods developed on Cartesian grids to solve HJB equations on surfaces, with a computational cost that scales with the dimension of the surfaces. This framework also provides a systematic way for solving HJB equations on the unstructured point clouds that are sampled from the surface."

The Rotation Measures (RM) of extragalactic (EG) sources have been the basis of comprehensive Galactic magnetic field models. Polarised extended emission (XE) is also seen along lines of sight through the Galactic disk, and also displays the effects of Faraday rotation. Our aim is to investigate and understand the relationship between EG and XE RMs near the Galactic plane, and to determine how the XE RMs, a hitherto unused resource, can be used as a probe of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We used polarisation data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS), observed near 1420 MHz with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Synthesis Telescope. We calculated RMs from a linear fit to the polarisation angles as a function of wavelength squared in four frequency channels, for both the EG sources and the XE. Across the CGPS area, $55^{\circ} < {\ell} <193^{\circ}, -3^{\circ} < b < 5^{\circ}$, the RMs of the XE closely track the RMs of the EG sources, with XE RMs about half the value of EG-source RMs. The exceptions are places where large local HII complexes heavily depolarise more distant emission. We conclude that there is valuable information in the XE RM dataset. The factor of 2 between the two types of RM values is close to that expected from a Burn slab model of the ISM. This result indicates that, at least in the outer Galaxy, the EG and XE sources are likely probing similar depths, and that the Faraday rotating medium and the synchrotron emitting medium have similar variation with galactocentric distance."

There are now multiple open source implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms, which provide basic abstraction and merging capabilities. Most of these tools and algorithms have been developed with one particular application in mind, which is program comprehension. The outputs models can abstract away the details of the program and represent the software behavior in a concise and easy to understand form. However, one application context that is less studied is using such inferred models for debugging, where the behavior to abstract is a faulty behavior (e.g., a set of execution traces including a failed test case). We tried to apply some of the existing model inference techniques (implemented in a promising tool called MINT) in a real-world industrial context to support program comprehension for debugging. Our initial experiments have shown many limitations both in terms of implementation as well as the algorithms. The paper will discuss the root cause of the failures and proposes ideas for future improvement."

Given the precision that future GW standard-siren experiments aim to achieve, the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies will be a major source of uncertainty. Unlike the conventional backward reconstruction that requires additional redshift-independent distance indicators to recover the peculiar velocity field, we forwardly model the peculiar velocity field by using a high-fidelity mock galaxy catalog built from high-resolution dark matter only (DMO) N-body simulations with a physically motivated subhalo abundance matching technique without introducing any free parameters. Our mock galaxy catalog can impressively well reproduce the observed spectroscopic redshift space distortions (RSDs) in highly non-linear regimes down to very small scales, which is a robust test of the velocity field of our mock galaxy catalog. Based on this mock galaxy catalog, we accurately, for the first time, measure the peculiar velocity probability distributions for the SDSS main galaxy samples. We find that the systematics induced by the peculiar velocities of SDSS like galaxies on the measured Hubble constant can be reduced to below $1\%$($1\sigma$) for GW host galaxies with a Hubble flow redshift just above $0.13$, a distance that can be well probed by future GW experiments and galaxy surveys."

This system firstly appeared in [Dinvay, Dutykh, Kalisch 2018], where it was numerically shown to be stable and a good approximation to the incompressible Euler equations. In subsequent papers [Dinvay 2018], [Dinvay, Selberg, Tesfahun 2019] the initial-value problem was studied and well-posedness in classical Sobolev spaces was proved. Here we prove existence of solitary wave solutions and provide their asymptotic description. Our proof relies on a variational approach and a concentration-compactness argument. The main difficulties stem from the fact that in the considered Euler-Lagrange equation we have a non-local operator of positive order appearing both in the linear and non-linear parts. Our approach allows us to obtain solitary waves for a particular Boussinesq system as well."

In the positive characteristic case, we can even demand that the valuation ring is henselian. Using this, we classify the positive characteristic dp-finite pure fields."

The medicine industry has adopted numerous methods to discover the root causes of many diseases in order to automate detection process. But, the biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are still unknown, let alone automating its detection. Studies from the neuroscience domain highlighted the fact that corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume holds significant information for detection of ASD. Such results and studies are not tested and verified by scientists working in the domain of computer vision / machine learning. Thus, in this study we have proposed a machine learning based framework for automatic detection of ASD using features extracted from corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume from ABIDE dataset. Corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data is obtained from T1-weighted MRI scans. Our proposed framework first calculates weights of features extracted from Corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data. This step ensures to utilize discriminative capabilities of only those features that will help in robust recognition of ASD. Then, conventional machine learning algorithm (conventional refers to algorithms other than deep learning) is applied on features that are most significant in terms of discriminative capabilities for recognition of ASD. Finally, for benchmarking and to verify potential of deep learning on analyzing neuroimaging data i.e. T1-weighted MRI scans, we have done experiment with state of the art deep learning architecture i.e. VGG16 . We have used transfer learning approach to use already trained VGG16 model for detection of ASD. This is done to help readers understand benefits and bottlenecks of using deep learning approach for analyzing neuroimaging data which is difficult to record in large enough quantity for deep learning."

There exists a substantial interest in automatizing this process due to the rapid growth of the available material. The recent progress has been facilitated by public benchmark datasets, which enable easy and fair comparison of methods. Currently the established evaluation protocol is to compare the generated summary with respect to a set of reference summaries provided by the dataset. In this paper, we will provide in-depth assessment of this pipeline using two popular benchmark datasets. Surprisingly, we observe that randomly generated summaries achieve comparable or better performance to the state-of-the-art. In some cases, the random summaries outperform even the human generated summaries in leave-one-out experiments. Moreover, it turns out that the video segmentation, which is often considered as a fixed pre-processing method, has the most significant impact on the performance measure. Based on our observations, we propose alternative approaches for assessing the importance scores as well as an intuitive visualization of correlation between the estimated scoring and human annotations."

The kinetic instabilities in the SW multi-ion plasma can lead to preferential heating of alpha particles and the dissipation of magnetic fluctuation energy, affecting the kinetic and global properties of the SW. Using for the first time a three-dimensional hybrid model, where ions are modeled as particle using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method and electrons are treated as fluid, we study the onset, nonlinear evolution and dissipation of ion kinetic instabilities. The Alfven/ion-cyclotron, and the ion drift instabilities are modeled in the region close to the Sun (~10R_s). Solar wind expansion is incorporated in the model. The model produces self-consistent non-Maxwellian velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of unstable ion populations, the associated temperature anisotropies, and wave spectra for several typical SW instability cases in the nonlinear growth and saturation stage of the instabilities. The 3D hybrid modeling of the multi-ion SW plasma could be used to study the SW acceleration region close to the Sun that will be explored by the Parker Solar Probe mission."

There are strict requirements to ensure that the evaluation methods are fair, objective and reasonable. However, existing metrics exhibit some obvious drawbacks: 1) They are not goal-oriented; 2) they cannot recognize the tightness of detection methods; 3) existing one-to-many and many-to-one solutions involve inherent loopholes and deficiencies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel evaluation protocol called Tightness-aware Intersect-over-Union (TIoU) metric that could quantify completeness of ground truth, compactness of detection, and tightness of matching degree. Specifically, instead of merely using the IoU value, two common detection behaviors are properly considered; meanwhile, directly using the score of TIoU to recognize the tightness. In addition, we further propose a straightforward method to address the annotation granularity issue, which can fairly evaluate word and text-line detections simultaneously. By adopting the detection results from published methods and general object detection frameworks, comprehensive experiments on ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015 datasets are conducted to compare recent metrics and the proposed TIoU metric. The comparison demonstrated some promising new prospects, e.g., determining the methods and frameworks for which the detection is tighter and more beneficial to recognize. Our method is extremely simple; however, the novelty is none other than the proposed metric can utilize simplest but reasonable improvements to lead to many interesting and insightful prospects and solving most the issues of the previous metrics.

The playing board is the set of edges of a given graph G, and the two players, Toucher and Isolator, claim edges alternately. The aim of Toucher is to `touch' as many vertices as possible (i.e. to maximise the number of vertices that are incident to at least one of her chosen edges), and the aim of Isolator is to minimise the number of vertices that are so touched.   We analyse the number of untouched vertices u(G) at the end of the game when both Toucher and Isolator play optimally, obtaining results both for general graphs and for particularly interesting classes of graphs, such as cycles, paths, trees, and k-regular graphs.

These compounds crystallizes in two structures resulting from the stacking of two and three blocks of [$A_2$Ni$_4$ + 2 $A$Ni$_5$] units for hexagonal $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$ (Ce$_2$Ni$_7$ type) and rhombohedral $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ (Gd$_2$Co$_7$ type) respectively. Experimentally, $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant antiferromagnet whereas $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant ferromagnet. From the present first principles calculation within non-spin polarized state, both compounds present an electronic density of state with a sharp and narrow peak centered at the Fermi level corresponding to flat bands from $3d$-Ni. This induces a magnetic instability and both compounds are more stable in a ferromagnetic (FM) order compared to a paramagnetic state ($\Delta E \simeq$ -35 meV/f.u.). The magnetic moment of each of the five Ni sites varies with their positions relative to the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] and [$A$Ni$_5$] units: they are minimum in the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] unit and maximum at the interface between two [$A$Ni$_5$] units. For $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure has been proposed and found with an energy comparable to that of the FM state. This AFM structure is described by two FM unit blocks of opposite Ni spin sign separated by a non-magnetic layer at z = 0 and $\frac12$. The Ni ($2a$) atoms belonging to this intermediate layer are located in the [La$_2$Ni$_4$] unit and are at a center of symmetry of the hexagonal cell ($P6_3/mmc$) where the resultant molecular field is cancelled. Further non-collinear spin calculations have been performed to determine the Ni moment orientations which are found preferentially parallel to the $c$ axis for both FM and AFM structures."

It considers molecular details in a coarse-grained fashion and reproduces hydrodynamic phenomena. Here, the implementation of multi-particle collision dynamics for isotropic fluids is analysed under the so-called Andersen-thermostatted scheme, a particular algorithm for systems in the canonical ensemble. This method gives rise to hydrodynamic fluctuations that spontaneously relax towards equilibrium. This relaxation process can be described by a linearized theory and used to calculate transport coefficients of the system. The extension of the algorithm for nematic liquid crystals is also considered. It is shown that thermal fluctuations in the average molecular orientation can be described by an extended linearized scheme. Flow fluctuations induce orientation fluctuations. However, orientational changes produce observable effects on velocity correlation functions only when simulation parameters exceed their values from those used in previous applications of the method. Otherwise, the flow can be considered to be independent of the orientation field."

It is established that in GaAs semiconductor, an increase in the electric field strength, depending on the direction, leads to an increase or decrease of the critical temperature (the critical concentration of adatoms), at which the formation of self-organized nanostructure is possible.

The nodes are interconnected by a network represented as an undirected graph, and the system is assumed to be synchronous. Under the classical point-to-point communication model, it is well-known [7] that the following two conditions are both necessary and sufficient to achieve Byzantine consensus among $n$ nodes in the presence of up to $f$ Byzantine faulty nodes: $n \ge 3f+1$ and vertex connectivity at least $2f+1$. In the classical point-to-point communication model, it is possible for a faulty node to equivocate, i.e., transmit conflicting information to different neighbors. Such equivocation is possible because messages sent by a node to one of its neighbors are not overheard by other neighbors.   This paper considers the local broadcast model. In contrast to the point-to-point communication model, in the local broadcast model, messages sent by a node are received identically by all of its neighbors. Thus, under the local broadcast model, attempts by a node to send conflicting information can be detected by its neighbors. Under this model, we show that the following two conditions are both necessary and sufficient for Byzantine consensus: vertex connectivity at least $\lfloor 3f/2 \rfloor + 1$ and minimum node degree at least $2f$. Observe that the local broadcast model results in a lower requirement for connectivity and the number of nodes $n$, as compared to the point-to-point communication model.   We extend the above results to a hybrid model that allows some of the Byzantine faulty nodes to equivocate. The hybrid model bridges the gap between the point-to-point and local broadcast models, and helps to precisely characterize the trade-off between equivocation and network requirements."

Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. The aim of this paper is to show changes in the number of published articles and citations after the flipping of a journal. We analysed a set of 171 journals in the Web of Science (WoS) which flipped to open access. In addition to comparing the number of articles, average relative citation (ARC) and normalized impact factor (IF) are applied, respectively, as bibliometric indicators at the article and journal level, to trace the transformation of flipped journals covered. Our results show that flipping mostly has had positive effects on journal's IF. But it has had no obvious citation advantage for the articles. We also see a decline in the number of published articles after flipping. We can conclude that flipping to open access can improve the performance of journals, despite decreasing the tendency of authors to submit their articles and no better citation advantages for articles."

However, most of this success is limited to simulation. While there are promising successes in applying RL algorithms directly on real systems, their performance on more complex systems remains bottle-necked by the relative data inefficiency of RL algorithms. Domain randomization is a promising direction of research that has demonstrated impressive results using RL algorithms to control real robots. At a high level, domain randomization works by training a policy on a distribution of environmental conditions in simulation. If the environments are diverse enough, then the policy trained on this distribution will plausibly generalize to the real world. A human-specified design choice in domain randomization is the form and parameters of the distribution of simulated environments. It is unclear how to the best pick the form and parameters of this distribution and prior work uses hand-tuned distributions. This extended abstract demonstrates that the choice of the distribution plays a major role in the performance of the trained policies in the real world and that the parameter of this distribution can be optimized to maximize the performance of the trained policies in the real world"

Most state-of-the-art epistemic planners solve this problem by compiling to propositional classical planning, for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms, or compiling epistemic formula to normal forms. However, these methods become computationally infeasible as problems grow. In this paper, we decompose epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about epistemic formula to an external solver. We do this by modelling the problem using \emph{functional STRIPS}, which is more expressive than standard STRIPS and supports the use of external, black-box functions within action models. Exploiting recent work that demonstrates the relationship between what an agent `sees' and what it knows, we allow modellers to provide new implementations of externals functions. These define what agents see in their environment, allowing new epistemic logics to be defined without changing the planner. As a result, it increases the capability and flexibility of the epistemic model itself, and avoids the exponential pre-compilation step. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic planning benchmarks to compare with an existing state-of-the-art planner, and on new scenarios based on different external functions. The results show that our planner scales significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner against which we compared, and can express problems more succinctly."

However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a major challenge."

We delineate the regime where wave effects are significant from the regime where geometric limit can be used. Further, we focus on the effect of micro-lensing and the combined effect of strong lensing and micro-lensing. We find that micro-lensing combined with strong lensing can introduce time varying phase shift in the signal and hence can lead to detectable differences in the signal observed for different images produced by strong lensing. This, coupled with the coarse localization of signal source in the sky for gravitational wave detections, can make it difficult to identify the common origin of signal corresponding to different images and use observables like time delay. In case we can reliably identify corresponding images, micro-lensing of individual images can be used as a tool to constrain properties of micro-lenses. Sources of gravitational waves can undergo microlensing due to lenses in the disk/halo of the Galaxy, or due to lenses in an intervening galaxy even in absence of strong lensing. In general the probability for this is small with one exception: Extragalactic sources of gravitational waves that lie in the galactic plane are highly likely to be micro-lensed. Wave effects are extremely important for such cases. In case of detections of such sources with low SNR, the uncertainty of occurrence of microlensing or otherwise introduces an additional uncertainty in the parameters of the source."

Commissioning a new detector implies defining and understanding a whole set of new variables. On the one hand the environmental conditions are followed, and on the other hand quantities related to the stability of the detector are monitored. Cosmic muons are ideal for studying the stability of SoLid, because of their abundance due to the small overburden. Muons can be used to study the timing synchronisation and energy calibration of the detector on a daily timescale. They can be used to monitor the detector stability and to correlate it with the environmental conditions. Muons also create secondary particles along their trajectory that can be detected and used for commissioning. For instance, spallation neutrons that are thermalized and captured in the detector can be used to verify the thermalisation properties of the detector. Stopping muon decays allow for a check of the muon decay time."

The obtained measurements can be used to achieve a better calibration of the asteroid photometric system $(H, G_1, G_2)$ adopted by the IAU, and to make comparisons with best-fit curves that can be obtained using different photometric systems. The new data have been obtained as a first feasibility study of a more extensive project planned for the future, aimed at obtaining a reliable calibration of possible relations between some parameters characterizing the phase-magnitude curves and the geometric albedo of asteroids. This has important potential applications to the analysis of asteroid photometric data obtained by the Gaia space mission."

The two-peak structure around 4450 MeV can be interpreted as two $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^*$ bound states with spin parities $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. The newly observed pentaquark $P_c(4312)$ can be assigned as a $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ bound state with spin parity $1/2^-$. The experimental determination of spin parities will be very helpful to understand the internal structure of these pentaquarks."

Identifying the odd parity $\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c(2625)$ resonances as HQSS partners, with total angular momentum--parity $j_q^P=1^-$ for the light degrees of freedom, we find that the ratios $\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2595)\pi^-)/\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2625)\pi^-)$ and $\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow \Lambda_c(2595) \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell)/ \Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2625) \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell)$ agree, within errors, with the experimental values given in the Review of Particle Physics. We discuss how future, and more precise, measurements of the above branching fractions could be used to shed light into the inner HQSS structure of the narrow $\Lambda_c(2595)$ odd-parity resonance. Namely, we show that such studies would constrain the existence of a sizable $j^P_q=0^-$ component in its wave-function, and/or of a two-pole pattern, in analogy to the case of the similar $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance in the strange sector, as suggested by most of the approaches that describe the $\Lambda_c(2595)$ as a hadron molecule. We also investigate the lepton flavor universality ratios $R[\Lambda_c^*] = {\cal B}(\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^* \tau\,\bar\nu_\tau)/{\cal B}(\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^* \mu\,\bar\nu_\mu)$, and discuss how $R[\Lambda_c(2595)]$ may be affected by a new source of potentially large systematic errors if there are two $\Lambda_c(2595)$ poles."

In this work, we show that in strained polar transition-metal dichalcogenides(TMDs) with 2H-structures, Berry-curvature dipoles created by spin degrees of freedom lead to strong nonlinear Hall effects. Under an easily accessible uniaxial strain of order 0.2%, strong nonlinear Hall signals, characterized by a Berry-curvature dipole on the order of 1{\AA}, arise in electron-doped polar TMDs such as MoSSe, and this is easily detectable experimentally. Moreover, the magnitude and sign of the nonlinear Hall current can be easily tuned by electric gating and strain. These properties can be used to distinguish nonlinear Hall effects from classical mechanisms such as ratchet effects. Importantly, our system provides a potential scheme for building electrically switchable energy-harvesting rectifiers."

It was discovered that this NEA is a new candidate LSFR. With the collected lightcurves from optical observations we are able to obtain the amplitude-phase relationship, sideral rotation period ($PS = 0.610752 \pm 0.000001$ h), a unique spin axis solution with ecliptic coordinates $ \lambda = 290^{\circ} \pm 3^{\circ}$, $\beta = 39^{\circ} \pm 2^{\circ}$ and the asteroid 3D model.

Therefore, the linearized field equations can have some solutions which do not come from the linearization of possible exact solutions. This fact can make the perturbation theory ill-defined, which would be a problem both at the classical and semiclassical quantization level. Here we study the first and second order perturbation theory in cosmological Einstein gravity and give the explicit form of the integral constraint, which is called the Taub charge, on the first order solutions for spacetimes with a Killing symmetry and a compact hypersurface without a boundary."

The filaments are considered as one-dimensional inextensible slender bodies with fixed aspect ratio, obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. To understand the global suspension behavior we relate it to the filament microstructure, deformation and elastic energy and examine the stress budget to quantify the effect of the elastic contribution. At fixed volume fraction, the viscosity of the suspension reduces when decreasing the bending rigidity and grows when increasing the Reynolds number. The change in the relative viscosity is stronger at finite inertia, although still in the laminar flow regime as considered here. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive as in polymeric fluids, and to increase with the Reynolds number; its value has a peak for an intermediate value of the filament bending stiffness. The peak value is found to be proportional to the Reynolds number, moving towards more rigid suspensions at larger inertia. Moreover, the viscosity increases when increasing the filament volume fraction, and the rate of increase of the filament stress with the bending rigidity is stronger at higher Reynolds numbers and reduces with the volume fraction. We show that this behaviour is associated with the formation of a more ordered structure in the flow, where filaments tend to be more aligned and move as a compact aggregate, thus reducing the filament-filament interactions despite their volume fraction increases."

The generalized Langevin equation is obtained for the general case of slip boundary conditions between the particle and the fluid. The Gaussian probability distributions for the particle to evolve in position-velocity space are deduced. It is proved that the joint probability distributions of forward and time-reversed paths have a ratio depending only on the work performed by the external force and the fluid temperature, in spite of the nonMarkovian character of the generalized Langevin process."

Simulation very often produces less accurate results due to the use of models that are simplifications of the real phenomena they try to model. Networking experimentation may offer limited repeatability and reproducibility. Being influenced by external random phenomena such as noise, interference, and multipath, real experiments are hardly repeatable. In addition, they are difficult to reproduce due to testbed operational constraints and availability. Without repeatability and reproducibility, the validation of the networking solution under evaluation is questionable. In this paper, we show how the Trace-based Simulation (TS) approach can be used to accurately repeat and reproduce real experiments and, consequently, introduce a paradigm shift when it comes to the evaluation of wireless networking solutions. We present an extensive evaluation of the TS approach using the Fed4FIRE+ w-iLab.2 testbed. The results show that it is possible to repeat and reproduce real experiments using ns-3 trace-based simulations with more accuracy than in pure simulation, with average accuracy gains above 50%."

Using multiple consecutive frames can improve detection of small objects or difficult examples and can improve speed and detection consistency in a video sequence, for instance by interpolating features between frames. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to perform online video object detection using two consecutive frames of video sequences involving road users. Two new models, RetinaNet-Double and RetinaNet-Flow, are proposed, based respectively on the concatenation of a target frame with a preceding frame, and the concatenation of the optical flow with the target frame. The models are trained and evaluated on three public datasets. Experiments show that using a preceding frame improves performance over single frame detectors, but using explicit optical flow usually does not."

The results indicate that planetary CO$_2$ budgets ranging from $\approx 3$ orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to $\approx 1$ order of magnitude larger, and radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyrs. The ability of stagnant lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored; recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is possible. For a ""hard"" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most CO$_2$ outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which occurs below the ice layer. However, for a ""soft"" snowball where there is exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both hard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum CO$_2$ budget needed for recovery; below this limit any snowball state would be permanent. Thus there is the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where planets with low CO$_2$ budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be permanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start with a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyrs or more. Finally, the model results have important implications for future exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely to possess habitable climates."

In contrast, modern instance segmentation approaches are dominated by methods that first detect object bounding boxes, and then crop and segment these regions, as popularized by Mask R-CNN. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task. Code will be made available."

Showing unambiguously that a minimal model actually can have a superconducting ground state remains a challenge at nonperturbative interactions. We make a significant step in this direction by computing ground states of the 2D \mbox{U-V} Hubbard model - the minimal model of the quasi-1D superconductors - by parallelized DMRG, which allows for systematic control of any bias and that is sign-problem-free. Using distributed-memory supercomputers and leveraging the advantages of the \mbox{U-V} model, we can treat unprecedented sizes of 2D strips and extrapolate their spin gap both to zero approximation error and the thermodynamic limit. Our results for the spin gap are shown to be compatible with a spin excitation spectrum that is either fully gapped or has zeros only in discrete points, and conversely that a Fermi liquid or magnetically ordered ground state is incompatible with them. Coupled with the enhancement to short-range correlations that we find exclusively in the $d_{xy}$ pairing-channel, this allows us to build an indirect case for the ground state of this model having superconducting order in the full 2D limit, and ruling out the other main possible phases, magnetic orders and Fermi liquids."

While instant per-request elasticity that FaaS platforms typically offer application developers makes it possible to achieve high performance of bursty workloads without over-provisioning, such elasticity often involves extra latency associated with on-demand provisioning of individual runtime containers that serve the functions. This phenomenon is often called cold starts, as opposed to the situation when a function is served by a pre-provisioned ""warm"" container, ready to serve requests with close to zero overhead. Providers are constantly working on techniques aimed at reducing cold starts. A common approach to reduce cold starts is to maintain a pool of warm containers, in anticipation of future requests. In this report, we address the cold start problem in serverless architectures, specifically under the Knative Serving FaaS platform. We describe our implementation leveraging a pool of function instances, and evaluate the latency compared to the original implementation, resulting in a 85% reduction of P99 response time for a single instance pool."

They can align themselves according to the direction of propulsion of their neighbours, together with a random perturbation (i.e. rotational fluctuation). They are also interacting with each other by a soft, isotropic, excluded-volume interaction. Particles are confined in a circular trap. The steepness of the trap is tuneable. Their average packing fraction and strength of rotational fluctuation are low. When the trap is steep, particles flock along its boundary. They form polar cluster that spreads over the boundary. The cluster has no spatial or structural order. We show, when the steepness is decreased beyond a threshold value, the clusters become round, compact and eventually spatial order (hexagonal) emerges in addition to the pre-established polar order within them. We investigate kinetics of such ordering. We find that while rotating around the centre of the trap along its circular boundary, the clusters need to roll around their centre of mass, to be spatially ordered. We also discuss the stability of the order when the trap is suddenly switched off."

While this interference depends on the neutron's {\it transverse} polarization and on {\it an imaginary part} of the nuclear amplitude, this conclusion holds only for the incident plane-wave neutrons with a definite momentum. Here we show that this scattering is altered when the twisted neutrons, recently obtained experimentally, are used instead -- that is, neutrons with an orbital angular momentum. For bulk targets, the angular distributions of the scattered neutrons get modified, while scattering of a superposition of states with the different angular momenta also reveals dependence on the longitudinal polarization. For well-localized targets, the observables develop a dependence on the neutron's {\it helicity} and on {\it a real part} of the nuclear amplitude, providing full access to its phase already in the Born approximation. We argue that the corresponding spin asymmetries are measurable at existing neutron facilities. Thus, scattering of the twisted neutrons by nuclei can provide means for quantum tomography of the neutron states and become a useful tool for hadronic studies, low-energy nuclear physics, tests of fundamental symmetries, and neutron optics."

In this paper we address the edge state properties of ordinary quantum Hall systems proximity coupled to s-wave superconductors, accounting explicitly for Landau quantization. We find that the appearance of topological superconducting phases with an odd number of Majorana edge modes is dependent on the structure of the system's vortex lattice. More precisely, vortex lattices containing odd number of superconducting flux quanta per unit cell, always support an even number of chiral edge channels and are therefore adiabatically connected to normal quantum Hall insulators. We discuss strategies to engineer chiral topological superconductivity in proximity-coupled quantum Hall systems by manipulating vortex lattice structure."

For $\Delta=\infty$ the celebrated Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem guarantees that perfect recovery is possible provided that the sampling rate $1/T_s$ exceeds the so-called Nyquist rate. Recent work by Bhandari et al. has shown that for any $\Delta>0$ perfect reconstruction is still possible if the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate by a factor of $\pi e$. In this letter we improve upon this result and show that for finite energy signals, perfect recovery is possible for any $\Delta>0$ and any sampling rate above the Nyquist rate. Thus, modulo folding does not degrade the signal, provided that the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate. This claim is proved by establishing a connection between the recovery problem of a discrete-time signal from its modulo reduced version and the problem of predicting the next sample of a discrete-time signal from its past, and leveraging the fact that for a bandlimited signal the prediction error can be made arbitrarily small."

Theoretical and algorithmic properties of the resulting sampling methods for $ \theta \in [0,1] $ and a range of step sizes are established. Our results generalize and extend prior works in several directions. In particular, for $\theta\ge1/2$, we prove geometric ergodicity and stability of the resulting methods for all step sizes.

The interstellar media (ISM) of the discs are modeled with continuous thermal phases. The models produce many unique structures, collectively called splash bridges. They range from central bridge discs to swirled sheets, which resemble those observed in interacting galaxies. These morphologies are sensitive to the rotation, relative mass, disc offsets and the gas structure in the discs. In the case of the Taffy galaxies - NGC 12914/15, extensive observations have revealed radio continuum emitting gas, HI gas, hot X-rays from hot diffuse gas and more $H_2$ than exists in the Milky Way coexisting in the bridge. The origins of the $H_2$ and large asymmetric distribution of ISM are not clear. We show that for small disc impact parameters, multiple phases of ISM with densities over many orders of magnitude can be removed from their host galaxies into a Taffy-like bridge. The orientation of the discs initial overlap can have a great effect on the distributions of each phase of ISM. In some cases, the models also predict the creation of a possible `dark galaxy,' a large flat region of dense ISM far from the stellar disc potential of either galaxy."

A significant body of research suggests that conventional neural networks can't solve this problem unless they are endowed with mechanisms specifically engineered for the purpose of representing symbols. In this paper we introduce a novel way of representing symbolic structures in connectionist terms - the vectors approach to representing symbols (VARS), which allows training standard neural architectures to encode symbolic knowledge explicitly at their output layers. In two simulations, we show that neural networks not only can learn to produce VARS representations, but in doing so they achieve combinatorial generalization in their symbolic and non-symbolic output. This adds to other recent work that has shown improved combinatorial generalization under specific training conditions, and raises the question of whether specific mechanisms or training routines are needed to support symbolic processing."

We show that similar X-wave structures could also be observed in expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates."

A novel technique to fabricate morphologically fascinating nano and micro structures of TiSiN is reported here. The referred TiSiN films, majorly constituted with cubic TiN phase, are enriched with crystalline nanoparticles, micro-flowers and faceted micro-crystals which possess attractive functionalities towards plasmon mediated optoelectronic applications. Reactivity of titanium to silicon nitride based dielectric topping on the substrate at high temperature plays the key role in nitride formation for the demonstrated protocol. The optoelectronic response for these morphologically enriched composite films indicates an influential role of photo-induced surface plasmon polaritons on their dc transport properties. A plasmonically tuned resistive switching, controlled by the surface morphology in association with the film thickness, is observed under light illumination. Using Drudes modified frequency dependent bulk electron scattering rates and surface mediated SPPs-electron scattering rates, a generic model is proposed for addressing unambiguously the increased device resistance in response to light. The featured synthesis process opens a new direction towards the growth of transition metal nitrides while the proposed model serves as a basic platform to understand photo-induced electron scattering mechanisms in metal."

We examine how FNDMC satisfies exact constraints, linearity and derivative discontinuity of total energy $E(N)$ vs. fractional electron number $N$, if combined with mean-field trial wave functions that miss such features. H and Cl atoms with fractional charge reveal that FNDMC is well able to restore the piecewise linearity of $E(N)$. The method uses ensemble and projector ingredients to achieve the correct charge localization. Water-solvated Cl$^-$ complex illustrates superior performance of FNDMC for charged noncovalent systems."

Two of the most popular innovative data plans are rollover and shared data plans, where the former plan allows a user to keep his unused data quota to next month and the latter plan allows users in a family to share unused data. As a pioneer to provide such data plans, a WSP faces immediate revenue loss from existing users who pay less overage charges due to less data over-usage, but his market share increases gradually by attracting new users and those under the other WSPs. In some countries, WSPs have asymmetric timing for providing such innovative data plans, while some other markets' WSPs have symmetric timing or no planning. This raises the question of why and when the competitive WSPs should offer the new data plans. This paper provides game theoretic modelling and analysis of the WSPs' timing of offering innovative data plans, by considering new user arrival and dynamic user churn between WSPs. Our equilibrium analysis shows that the WSP with small market share prefers to announce the innovative data plan first to attract more users, while the WSP with large market share prefers to announce later to avoid the immediate revenue loss. In a market with many new users, WSPs with similar market shares will offer the data plans simultaneously, but these WSPs facing few new users may not offer any new plan. Perhaps surprisingly, WSPs' profits can decrease with new user number and they may not benefit from the option of innovative data plans. Finally, unlike rollover data plan, we show that the timing of shared data plan further depends on the composition of users."

This paper proposes a neural architecture that can jointly (1) detect if two bug reports are duplicates, and (2) aggregate them into latent topics. Leveraging the assumption that learning the topic of a bug is a sub-task for detecting duplicates, we design a loss function that can jointly perform both tasks but needs supervision for only duplicate classification, achieving topic clustering in an unsupervised fashion. We use a two-step attention module that uses self-attention for topic clustering and conditional attention for duplicate detection. We study the characteristics of two types of real world datasets that have been marked for duplicate bugs by engineers and by non-technical annotators. The results demonstrate that our model not only can outperform state-of-the-art methods for duplicate classification on both cases, but can also learn meaningful latent clusters without additional supervision."

In literature analysis, such networks have mostly been analyzed without particular relation types or focusing on roles which the characters take with respect to each other. We argue that an important aspect for the analysis of stories and their development is the emotion between characters. In this paper, we combine these aspects into a unified framework to classify emotional relationships of fictional characters. We formalize it as a new task and describe the annotation of a corpus, based on fan-fiction short stories. The extraction pipeline which we propose consists of character identification (which we treat as given by an oracle here) and the relation classification. For the latter, we provide results using several approaches previously proposed for relation identification with neural methods. The best result of 0.45 F1 is achieved with a GRU with character position indicators on the task of predicting undirected emotion relations in the associated social network graph."

It may be possible to overcome this by spatially selective stimulation of peripheral nerves. Preliminary studies have shown this is possible using a cylindrical multielectrode nerve cuff optimised for human vagus nerve selective neuromodulation. The design was optimised initially by computer modelling. This suggested two rings of 14 electrodes, 3 mm apart, with 0.4 mm electrode width and separation and length 0.5-3 mm, with stimulation through a pair in the same radial position on the two rings. The electrodes were fabricated using PDMS-embedded stainless steel foil and PEDOT: pTS coating. In the cervical vagus nerve in anaesthetised sheep, it was possible to selectively reduce the respiratory rate (RR) by 85 +/- 5% without affecting heart rate, or selectively reduce heart rate (HR) by 20 +/- 7% without affecting respiratory rate. The cardiac- and pulmonary-specific sites on the nerve cross-sectional perimeter were localised with a radial separation of 105 +/- 5 degrees (P < 0.01, N = 24 in 12 sheep). This suggests there is organotopic organisation of neural fibres in the cervical vagus nerve. It demonstrates, for the first time, selective electrical neuromodulation without adverse side effects. It may be possible to translate this to improved treatment by electrical autonomic neuromodulation for currently intractable conditions."

In particular $\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPT can be triggered by double-well potentials and dumbbell-shaped equipotential hypersurfaces. In this paper we introduce some models with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPT, that, due to their essential feature, show in the clearest way the generating-mechanism of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPTs above-mentioned. These models, despite they are not physical models, may enlighten some aspects of phase transitions again remained obscure. For instance, the study of the relation with the critical points, and the topology of the equipotential hypersurfaces can be greatly simplified by the fact that the potentials have only three critical points. A comparison with the mean-field $\phi^4$ model has been made revealing the same geometric picture of the models introduced in this paper."

Also, we determine the Frobenius dimension of the product and tensor product of two nearly Frobenius algebras from the Frobenius dimension of each of them. We apply these results to semisimple algebras.   In the second part we introduce the notion of normalized nearly Frobenius algebra. We prove a series of equivalences: the concept of normalized nearly Frobenius algebra is equivalent to the concept of separable algebra, equivalent to the fact that the algebra is projective as a bimodule on itself and, finally, equivalent to the category of bimodules is semisimple. Also, we relate these concepts with the property of semisimplicity of the category of modules over the algebra."

This phase behavior can be explained by presuming the predominance of hard-core volume exclusion between the particles. We show here how the self-organization of rodlike colloids can be controlled by introducing a weak and highly localized directional attractive interaction between one of the ends of the particles. This has been performed by functionalizing the tips of filamentous viruses by means of regioselectively grafting fluorescent dyes onto them, resulting in a hydrophobic patch whose attraction can be tuned by varying the number of bound dye molecules. We show, in agreement with our computer simulations, that increasing the single tip attraction stabilizes the smectic phase at the expense of the nematic phase, leaving all other liquid crystalline phases invariant. For a sufficiently strong tip attraction, the nematic state may be suppressed completely to get a direct isotropic liquid-to-smectic phase transition. Our findings provide insights into the rational design of building blocks for functional structures formed at low densities."

Many applications such as videoconferencing, films, games, and generation of training data for gaze estimation require redirecting the gaze, without distorting the appearance of the area surrounding the eye and while producing photo-realistic images. Existing methods lack the ability to generate perceptually plausible images. In this work, we present a novel method to alleviate this problem by leveraging generative adversarial training to synthesize an eye image conditioned on a target gaze direction. Our method ensures perceptual similarity and consistency of synthesized images to the real images. Furthermore, a gaze estimation loss is used to control the gaze direction accurately. To attain high-quality images, we incorporate perceptual and cycle consistency losses into our architecture. In extensive evaluations we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and redirection precision. Finally, we show that generated images can bring significant improvement for the gaze estimation task if used to augment real training data."

The dark sector is connected to the Standard Model(SM) via three righthanded SM singlet neutrinos, $N_R$'s, and the kinetic mixing between $U(1)_s$ and $U(1)_Y$. A mixing between the scalar $\phi$ that breaks $U(1)_s$ and the SM Higgs boson, $H$, is implemented via the term $\phi^\dagger \phi H^\dagger H$ and this provides a third connection to the SM. Integrating out the $N_R$ at a high scale not only gives the active neutrinos, $\nu$, masses but generates effective Dirac type of couplings between $\nu$ and $\chi$. This changes the usual Type-I seesaw results for active neutrino masses and makes $\chi$ behave like a sterile neutrino even though its origin is in the hidden sector. $\chi$ is also split into a pair of Majorana fermions. The amount of splitting depends on the parameters. If the lighter of the pair has a mass around keV, its lifetime is longer than the age of the universe and it can be a warm dark matter candidate. Signatures of $\chi$ in high precision Kurie plots of nuclei $\beta$ decays and low energy neutrino nuclei coherent scatterings are discussed. The model also induces new invisible $Z$ decay modes that can be searched for in future Z factories."

The formula is considerably simplified when applying to ""pluriharmonic perturbations"" of the sphere or to a Fefferman approximate solution to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. As an application, we show that the CR invariant one-form $X_{\alpha}$ constructed recently by Case and Gover is nontrivial on each real ellipsoid of revolution in $\mathbb{C}^3$, unless it is equivalent to the sphere. This resolves affirmatively a question posed by these two authors in 2017 regarding the (non-) local CR invariance of the $\mathcal{I}'$-pseudohermitian invariant in dimension five and provides a counterexample to a recent conjecture by Hirachi."

Direct simulations of these systems that capture the motion and deformation of many immersed filaments in suspension remain a formidable computational challenge due to the complex, coupled fluid--structure interactions of all filaments, the numerical stiffness associated with filament bending, and the various constraints that must be maintained as the filaments deform. In this paper, we address these challenges by first describing filament kinematics using quaternions to resolve both bending and twisting, applying implicit time-integration to alleviate numerical stiffness, and using quasi-Newton methods to obtain solutions to the resulting system of nonlinear equations. In particular, we employ geometric time integration to ensure that the quaternions remain unit as the filaments move. We also show that our framework can be used with a variety of models and methods, including matrix-free fast methods, that resolve low Reynolds number hydrodynamic interactions. We provide a series of tests and example simulations to demonstrate the performance and possible applications of our method. Finally, we provide a link to a MATLAB/Octave implementation of our framework that can be used to learn more about our approach and as a tool for filament simulation."

Statistical mechanics traditionally studied this transition with connectivity $k$ as the control parameter and an exactly balanced excitation-inhibition ratio. While critical connectivity has been found to be low in these model systems, typically around $k=2$, which is unrealistic for natural systems, a recent study utilizing the excitation-inhibition ratio as the control parameter found a new, nearly degree independent, critical point when connectivity is large. However, the new phase transition is accompanied by an unnaturally high level of activity in the network.   Here we study random neural networks with the additional properties of (i) a high clustering coefficient and (ii) neurons that are solely either excitatory or inhibitory, a prominent property of natural neurons. As a result, we observe an additional critical point for networks with large connectivity, regardless of degree distribution, which exhibits low activity levels that compare well with neuronal brain networks."

This region is the boundary between the landscape of consistent low-energy limits of quantum gravity, and the swampland of theories that cannot be embedded within string theory because they violate certain trendy and obviously uncontroversial conjectures. The Marshland is probably fractal, and we show some pretty pictures of fractals that will be useful in talks. We further show that the Marshland contains theories with a large number of light axions, allowing us to cite lots of our own papers. We show that the Marshland makes up most of the volume of the landscape, and admits a novel, weakly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Marshymmetry that we find strong evidence for by considering a carefully crafted example."

We discuss some properties of the derived category of a (one-sided) exact category and its embedding into its derived category.   Our main application is the localization of a one-sided exact category $\mathcal{E}$ with respect to a percolating subcategory $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{E}$. We show that the quotient functor $\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E} / \mathcal{A}$ lifts to a Verdier localization $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{E}) \to \mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{E} / \mathcal{A})$.   We also consider localizations of the exact category $\mathsf{LCA}$ of locally compact abelian groups and show that any quotient of $\mathsf{LCA}$ by a (left or right) percolating subcategory is again exact. This implies that the quotients of $\mathsf{LCA}$ by the subcategory of compact groups or the (finitely generated) discrete groups is two-sided exact.   We further discuss the exact hull $\overline{\mathcal{E}}$ and weak idempotent completion $\widehat{\mathcal{E}}$ of a one-sided exact category $\mathcal{E}$, and we show that the canonical embeddings lift to triangle equivalences on the bounded derived categories."

While great efforts have been spent on the DQCP for 2D systems, both theoretically and numerically, ambiguities among the nature of the transition are still not completely clarified. Here we shift the focus to a recently proposed 1D incarnation of DQCP in a spin-1/2 chain. By solving it with the variational matrix product state in the thermodynamic limit, a continuous transition between a valence-bond solid phase and a ferromagnetic phase is discovered. The scaling dimensions of various operators are calculated and compared with those from field theoretical description. At the critical point, two emergent O(2) symmetries are revealed, and the associated conserved current operators with exact integer scaling dimensions are determined with scrutiny. Our findings provide the low-dimensional analog of DQCP where unbiased numerical results are in perfect agreement with the controlled field theoretical predictions and have extended the realm of the unconventional phase transition as well as its identification with the advanced numerical methodology."

This may lead to a scenario that was not postulated in the design phase. Due to this, formulating a rule based decision maker for selecting maneuvers may not be ideal. Similarly, it may not be effective to design an a-priori cost function and then solve the optimal control problem in real-time. In order to address these issues and to avoid peculiar behaviors when encountering unforeseen scenario, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, where the ego car, i.e., an autonomous vehicle, learns to make decisions by directly interacting with simulated traffic. The decision maker for AV is implemented as a deep neural network providing an action choice for a given system state. In a critical application such as driving, an RL agent without explicit notion of safety may not converge or it may need extremely large number of samples before finding a reliable policy. To best address the issue, this paper incorporates reinforcement learning with an additional short horizon safety check (SC). In a critical scenario, the safety check will also provide an alternate safe action to the agent provided if it exists. This leads to two novel contributions. First, it generalizes the states that could lead to undesirable ""near-misses"" or ""collisions "". Second, inclusion of safety check can provide a safe and stable training environment. This significantly enhances learning efficiency without inhibiting meaningful exploration to ensure safe and optimal learned behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm in highway driving scenario where the trained AV encounters varying traffic density in a highway setting."

While these properties indicate formation by collision, there is no self-consistent and reasonably probable formation hypothesis that can connect the unusually rapid spin and the low relative velocities of Haumea family members (""Haumeans""). We explore and test the proposed formation hypotheses (catastrophic collision, graze-and-merge, and satellite collision). We flexibly parameterize the properties of the collision (e.g., the collision location) and use simple models for the three-dimensional velocity ejection field expected from each model to generate simulated families. These are compared to observed Kuiper Belt Objects using Bayesian parameter inference, including a mixture model that allows for interlopers from the background population. After testing our methodology, we find the best match to the observed Haumeans is an isotropic ejection field with a typical velocity of 150 m s$^{-1}$. The graze-and-merge and satellite collision hypotheses are disfavored. Including these constraints, we discuss the formation hypotheses in detail, including variations, some of which are tested. Some new hypotheses are proposed (a cratering collision and a collision where Haumea's upper layers are ""missing"") and scrutinized. We do not identify a satisfactory formation hypothesis, but we do propose several avenues of additional investigation. In addition, we identify many new candidate Haumeans and dynamically confirm 7 of them as consistent with the observed family. We confirm that Haumeans have a shallow size distribution and discuss implications for the identification of new Haumeans."

However, traditional spectroscopic methods that utilize stellar models struggle to reproduce cool ($<$4700 K) stellar atmospheres due to an abundance of unconstrained molecular transitions, making modeling via synthetic spectral libraries difficult. Because small, cool stars such as K and M dwarfs are both common and good targets for finding small, cool planets, establishing precise spectral modeling techniques for these stars is of high priority. To address this, we apply The Cannon, a data-driven method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool ($<$5200 K) stars from the California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting labels for small ($<$1 $R_{\odot}$) stars of spectral types K and later with accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature ($T_{eff}$), 5% in stellar radius ($R_{*}$), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]), and maintains this performance at low spectral resolutions ($R$ $<$ 5000). As M-dwarfs are the focus of many future planet-detection surveys, this work can aid efforts to better characterize the cool star population and uncover correlations between cool star abundances and planet occurrence for constraining planet formation theories."

However, these sophisticated biological tools currently use ad-hoc and outmoded computational methods to reconstruct the cell lineage tree from the mutated barcodes. Because these methods are agnostic to the biological mechanism, they are unable to take full advantage of the data's structure. We propose a statistical model for the mutation process and develop a procedure to estimate the tree topology, branch lengths, and mutation parameters by iteratively applying penalized maximum likelihood estimation. In contrast to existing techniques, our method estimates time along each branch, rather than number of mutation events, thus providing a detailed account of tissue-type differentiation. Via simulations, we demonstrate that our method is substantially more accurate than existing approaches. Our reconstructed trees also better recapitulate known aspects of zebrafish development and reproduce similar results across fish replicates."

This paper considers the problem of estimating treatment effects when measured connections are, instead, a noisy representation of the true spillover pathways. We show that existing methods, using the potential outcomes framework, yield biased estimators in the presence of this mismeasurement. We develop a new method, using a class of mixture models, that can account for missing connections and discuss its estimation via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We check our method's performance by simulating experiments on real network data from 43 villages in India. Finally, we use data from a previously published study to show that estimates using our method are more robust to the choice of network measure."

In this work, we describe a new method to expose GAN-synthesized images using the locations of the facial landmark points. Our method is based on the observations that the facial parts configuration generated by GAN models are different from those of the real faces, due to the lack of global constraints. We perform experiments demonstrating this phenomenon, and show that an SVM classifier trained using the locations of facial landmark points is sufficient to achieve good classification performance for GAN-synthesized faces."

The (dimensionless) control parameters are the Reynolds numbers of the inner and outer cylinder, the ratio of the cylinder radii, and the aspect ratio. The response of the system is the torque required to retain constant angular velocities, which can be connected to the angular velocity transport through the gap. While the low Reynolds number regime has been very well explored in the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity only developed in the last decade. In this paper we review this recent progress in our understanding of fully developed Taylor-Couette turbulence, from the experimental, numerical, and theoretical point of view. We will focus on the parameter dependence of the global torque and on the local flow organisation, including velocity profiles and boundary layers. Next, we will discuss transitions between different (turbulent) flow states. We will also elaborate on the relevance of this system for astrophysical disks (Keplerian flows). The review ends with a list of challenges for future research on turbulent Taylor-Couette flow.   The published version in ARFM: Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 48:53-80 (2016)."

The goal is to leverage knowledge from the source robot such that the target robot achieves high-accuracy trajectory tracking on arbitrary trajectories from the first attempt with minimal data recollection and training. Most existing approaches for multi-robot knowledge transfer are based on post-analysis of datasets collected from both robots. In this work, we study the feasibility of impromptu transfer of models across robots by learning an error prediction module online. In particular, we analytically derive the form of the mapping to be learned by the online module for exact tracking, propose an approach for characterizing similarity between robots, and use these results to analyze the stability of the overall system. The proposed approach is illustrated in simulation and verified experimentally on two different quadrotors performing impromptu trajectory tracking tasks, where the quadrotors are required to accurately track arbitrary hand-drawn trajectories from the first attempt."

We report the discovery of an asymmetric extended structure northwest of the star, independent from the continuum point source. The structure is only traced by continuum and HCO$^+$, and not detected in the other lines. Kinematics of this structure reveal that the HCO$^+$ gas likely arises from ejecta expelled in the 1890s eruption. The ejecta is propagating outward within the cavity produced by the current wind-wind interaction of Eta Car A and its companion. Chemical analysis of the ejecta reveals an apparent lack of CO and nitrogen-bearing species. We explore possible explanations for this peculiar chemistry, that differentiates this structure from the ejecta of the Great Eruption, rich in HCN and H$^{13}$CN. We also report an absorption component near the continuum point source, only traced by HCN and H$^{13}$CN in their vibrational-ground and vibrationally-excited states. This absorbing gas is attributed to a hot bullet of N-enriched material expelled at a projected velocity of 40 km s$^{-1}$."

Developing an artificial intelligence system that can automatically make lab test imputations and medication recommendations can save cost on potentially redundant lab tests and inform physicians in more effective prescription. We present an intelligent model that can automatically recommend the patients' medications based on their incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately estimate the lab values that have not been taken. We model the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with their inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we learn a distributed representation for each entity in the graph based on graph convolutional networks to make the representations integrate information from multiple types of entities. Since the entity representations incorporate multiple types of medical information, they can be used for multiple medical tasks. In our experiments, we construct a graph to associate patients, encounters, lab tests and medications, and conduct the two tasks: medication recommendation and lab test imputation. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art models in both tasks."

Here we measure the thermal conductivity of crystalline AlN by the 3${\omega}$ method, finding it ranges from 674 ${\pm}$ 56 W/m/K at 100 K to 186 ${\pm}$ 7 W/m/K at 400 K, with a value of 237 ${\pm}$ 6 W/m/K at room temperature. We compare these data with analytical models and first principles calculations, taking into account atomic-scale defects (O, Si, C impurities, and Al vacancies). We find Al vacancies play the greatest role in reducing thermal conductivity because of the largest mass-difference scattering. Modeling also reveals that 10% of heat conduction is contributed by phonons with long mean free paths, over ~7 ${\mu}$m at room temperature, and 50% by phonons with MFPs over ~0.3 ${\mu}$m. Consequently, the effective thermal conductivity of AlN is strongly reduced in sub-micron thin films or devices due to phonon-boundary scattering."

The resulting DP-ZBL model can not only provide overall good performance on the predictions of near-equilibrium material properties but also capture the right physics when atoms are extremely close to each other, an event that frequently happens in computational simulations of irradiation damage events. We applied this scheme to the simulation of the irradiation damage processes in the face-centered-cubic aluminium system, and found better descriptions in terms of the defect formation energy, evolution of collision cascades, displacement threshold energy, and residual point defects, than the widely-adopted ZBL modified embedded atom method potentials and its variants. Our work provides a reliable and feasible scheme to accurately simulate the irradiation damage processes and opens up new opportunities to solve the predicament of lacking accurate potentials for enormous newly-discovered materials in the irradiation effect field."

This approach completely voids session hijacking for the mqtt protocol and provides authenticity without the need for any network-security nor channel-security nor broker-based predefined ACLs. The presented approach does not require the broker to keep any secrets for session handling, what so ever. Moreover, it allows the clientID, which represents the identification for a session, to be publicly known. The presented approach allows completely anonymous but authentic sessions, hence the broker does not need any a priori knowledge of the client-party. As it is especially targeted for applications within the world of IoT, the presented approach is tuned to require only the minimum in extra power in terms of energy and space. The approach does not introduce any new concept, but simply fusions a state-of-the-art cryptographic zero knowledge proof of identity with the existing MQTT-5 specification. Thus no protocol extension is required in order to provide the targeted security properties. The described approach is completely agnostic to the application layer at the client side and is only required during mqtt-session establishment."

We show that there are still models like the mean-field Potts model, where EES does not converge rapidly in certain temperature regimes. Indeed we will show that EES is slowly mixing on the mean-field Potts model, in a regime below the critical temperature. Though we will concentrate on the Potts model with three colors, our arguments remain valid for any number of colors $q \ge 3$, if we adapt the temperature regime. For the situation of the mean-field Potts model this answers a question posed in \cite{HuaKou}."

Our consideration is based on the off-shell amplitudes for hard partonic subprocesses and on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) formalism for the formation of bound states. We try two latest parametrizations for noncollinear, or transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon densities derived from the Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) equation. We use the values of the nonperturbative matrix elements obtained from a combined fit of the $\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$ differential cross sections. Finally, we show an universal set of parameters that provides a reasonable simultaneous description for all of the available data on the prompt $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ production at the LHC."

Further approaches were introduced later on. These approaches (with few exceptions) are here discussed, developed and interrelated. Among other things, different facets of soundness, completeness, decidability and independence are investigated. Specifically arithmetization (Leibniz), algebraization (Leibniz and Boole), and Venn models (Euler and Venn) are closely examined. All proofs are simple. In particular there is no recourse to maximal nor minimal conditions (with only one, dispensable, exception), which makes the long awaited deciphering of the enigmatic Leibniz characteristic numbers possible. The problem was how to look at matters from the right perspective."

Here we seek to explore if and how well Deep Neural Network (DNN) models capture features similar to the brain's representation of humans, objects, and their interactions. We investigate brain regions which process human-, object-, or interaction-specific information, and establish correspondences between them and DNN features. Our results suggest that we can infer the selectivity of these regions to particular visual stimuli using DNN representations. We also map features from the DNN to the regions, thus linking the DNN representations to those found in specific parts of the visual cortex. In particular, our results suggest that a typical DNN representation contains encoding of compositional information for human-object interactions which goes beyond a linear combination of the encodings for the two components, thus suggesting that DNNs may be able to model this important property of biological vision."

Taylor series expansion of a power system dynamic model is calculated around multiple equilibria corresponding to different load levels. The terms of Taylor expansion are converted to the tensor format and reduced into smaller-size matrices with the help of tensor decomposition. The approach adaptively changes the complexity of a power system model based on the size of a disturbance to maintain the compromise between high simulation speed and high accuracy of the reduced model. The proposed approach is compared with a traditional linear model reduction approach on the 140-bus 48-machine Northeast Power Coordinating Council system.

The heterogeneous server structure of the system makes the scheduling much harder than scheduling for systems with homogeneous servers. Throughput optimality of the system on one hand and delay optimality on the other hand creates a dilemma for assigning tasks to servers. The JSQ-MaxWeight and Balanced-Pandas algorithms are the states of the arts algorithms with theoretical guarantees on throughput and delay optimality for systems with two and three levels of data locality. However, the scheduling complexity of these two algorithms are way too much. Hence, we use the power of $d$ choices algorithm combined with the Balanced-Pandas algorithm and the JSQ-MaxWeight algorithm, and compare the complexity of the simple algorithms and the power of $d$ choices versions of them. We will further show that the Balanced-Pandas algorithm combined with the power of the $d$ choices, Balanced-Pandas-Pod, not only performs better than simple Balanced-Pandas, but also is less sensitive to the parameter $d$ than the combination of the JSQ-MaxWeight algorithm and the power of the $d$ choices, JSQ-MaxWeight-Pod. In fact in our extensive simulation results, the Balanced-Pandas-Pod algorithm is performing better than the simple Balanced-Pandas algorithm in low and medium loads, where data centers are usually performing at, and performs almost the same as the Balanced-Pandas algorithm at high loads. Note that the load balancing complexity of Balanced-Pandas and JSQ-MaxWeight algorithms are $O(M)$, where $M$ is the number of servers in the system which is in the order of thousands servers, whereas the complexity of Balanced-Pandas-Pod and JSQ-MaxWeight-Pod are $O(1)$, that makes the central scheduler faster and saves energy."

The large amount of generated sensor data is expected to be exchanged with other CAVs and the road-side infrastructure. Both in Europe and the US, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems, based on the IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer, are key enabler for the communication among vehicles. Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band of 75 MHz, dedicated to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly congested. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a vehicular communication system, operated over the unlicensed bands 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz - 5.875 GHz. Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing track in the centre of Bristol, UK and our system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5 implementation. Our performance investigation compares key communication metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal strength indicator) measured by operating our system over the licensed DSRC and the considered unlicensed bands. In particular, when operated over the 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz band, our system achieves comparable performance to the case when the DSRC band is used. On the other hand, as soon as the system, is operated over the 5.725 GHz - 5.875 GHz band, the packet delivery rate is 30% smaller compared to the case when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system over unlicensed ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental evaluation, we recorded all the generated network interactions and the complete data set has been publicly available."

We characterize the bias and variance of the resulting Taylor-corrected estimators using the Lagrange error formula. Furthermore, we introduce a family of variance reduction techniques that can be applied to other gradient estimators. Finally, we show that these new perturbative methods can be extended to discrete functions using analytic continuation. Using this technique, we derive a new gradient descent method for training stochastic networks with binary weights. In our experiments, we show that the perturbative correction improves the convergence of stochastic variational inference both in the continuous and in the discrete case."

Our experiments show that the multi-task training not only tackles the complexity of optimizing CTC models such as acoustic-to-word but also results in significant improvement compared to the plain-task training with an optimal setup. Furthermore, we propose to use the encoding representation learned by the multi-task network to initialize the encoder of attention-based models. Thereby, we train a deep attention-based end-to-end model with 10 long short-term memory (LSTM) layers of encoder which produces 12.2\% and 22.6\% word-error-rate on Switchboard and CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation."

This catastrophic failure mode is limiting for amorphous materials in many applications, and many fundamental questions surrounding it remain poorly understood. Two challenges that prevent a more fundamental understanding of the transition between a ductile response at temperatures near $T_g$ to brittle failure at lower temperatures are i) a lack of computationally inexpensive molecular models that capture the failure modes observed in experiments and ii) the lack of quantitative metrics that can distinguish various failure mechanisms. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to capture ductile-to-brittle transition in glass-forming short-chain polymer systems by using a modified Lennard-Jones potential to describe non-bonded interactions between the monomers. We characterized the effects of this new potential on macroscopic mechanical properties as well as microscopic structural and dynamical differences during deformation. Lastly, we present quantitative metrics that distinguish between different failure modes."

Though not take part in neutrino oscillation, the sterile neutrino can induce flavor violating semileptonic and leptonic decay of $K, D$ and $B$ mesons. We calculated a box diagram contribution in these processes. By making use of current experiment limit of lepton flavor violating decays $M^+_h\to M_l^+\ell_1^+\ell_2^-$ and $M^0\to \ell_1^-\ell_2^+$, we explore the allowed parameter space of $U_{e4}$ and $U_{\mu 4}$ in different mass ranges. Generally speaking, both channels give a limit to the product of $U_{e4}$ and $U_{\mu 4}$. When sterile neutrino mass is located in between pion and kaon mass, $K^+\to \pi^+ e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$ gives the strongest constraint while $B^+\to \pi^+ e^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$ provides the dominated constraint when its mass in between of kaon and B meson. If sterile neutrino is even heavier than B mesons, the $B^0_s\to \mu^{\pm} e^{\mp}$ experiment which is performed at LHCb gives the strongest constraint."

If $n=1$, then a description of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ is known. In this paper, we calculate the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ for the case $n \geq 2$. As an application, we see that the structure of the bounded derived category of the noncommutative projective scheme of $A$ is different depending on whether $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix} \alpha &1 \\ \beta &0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)^n\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ is zero or not.

For this purpose, we propose a novel systematic approach that employs a distance measure for ellipses, i.e., the Gaussian Wasserstein distance, as a cost function. We derive an explicit approximate expression for the Minimum Mean Gaussian Wasserstein distance (MMGW) estimate. Based on the concept of a MMGW estimator, we develop efficient methods for the fusion of extended target estimates.

Due to their size, such nanodiscoids have a comparatively large boundary-to-area ratio, making them unusually well-suited to probing the effects of Gaussian curvature. Arguing that fluctuations in discoid size and shape are quenched on formation, we quantify the stability, in terms of size and shape, of near-solvation discoid-like flaps that are subject to thermal fluctuations. Using cryo-Electron Microscopy images of Styrene Maleic Acid stabilised discoids, we deduce that stable, saddle-like discoids (with high Gaussian curvature) can likely be solvated from bulk lamellar ($L_\alpha$) phase at moderate-to-high surface tensions ($>10^{-4}$ N/m). We then describe how such tension-controlled solvation can be used for both measuring, and fractionating membrane components according-to, the modulus of Gaussian rigidity $\bar{\kappa}$. Opportunities for investigating the effects of Gaussian curvature on membrane-embedded proteins, which can be co-solvated during the formation process, are also discussed."

A Verification,"The paper [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] considers how human players compare to algorithms for solving the Quantum Moves game BringHomeWater and design new algorithms based on the intuition extracted from players. The claim by [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] is that players outperform widely used algorithms, in particular the KASS algorithm, based on the Krotov algorithm, and that player intuition is crucial to develop improved methods. However, as initially discussed by D. Sels [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97], a standard Coordinate Ascent algorithm outperforms all players by a large margin. Albeit D. Sels only compare to player solutions, the simple algorithm outperforms all algorithms based on player solutions and Krotov, and it does so using much less time and iterations. In this paper we elaborate on the methods discussed by D. Sels and verify that the presented algorithm, solves the problem better than all players and algorithms derived from player solutions in [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532]. We also verify the theoretical analysis presented by D. Sels, that gives a theoretically derived protocol that outperforms all players. We add a comparison with gradient ascent or GRAPE. Starting from uniform random values, GRAPE outperforms all players by a large margin. GRAPE works at least as well as the methods from [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] initialized with player solutions. A standard analysis of the results from GRAPE provides a starting point for GRAPE, that outperform all algorithms from [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532]. We compare with a basic Krotov algorithm, and get results similar to GRAPE, clearly outperforming players and the KASS algorithm. These experiments verify and underline the result in [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97] that the conclusions from [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] regarding algorithms are untenable. In fact the opposite conclusions are true."

Each vertex is partially copied with the same rate, i.e.\ an existing vertex is copied and every edge leading to the copied vertex is copied with independent probability $p$. In addition, every edge is deleted at constant rate, a mechanism which extends previous partial duplication models. In this model, we obtain results on the degree distribution, which shows a phase transition such that either -- if $p$ is small enough -- the frequency of isolated vertices converges to 1, or there is a positive fraction of vertices with unbounded degree. We derive results on the degrees of the initial vertices as well as on the sub-graph of non-isolated vertices. In particular, we obtain expressions for the number of star-like subgraphs and cliques."

It is known, due to Alberti, Cs\""ornyei, and Preiss, that such measures are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the result of A-C-P. Assuming that the representations of $\mu$ are bounded from above, in a natural way to be defined in the introduction, we prove that $\mu \in L^{2}$. If the representations are also bounded from below, we show that $\mu$ satisfies a reverse H\""older inequality with exponent $2$, and is consequently in $L^{2 + \epsilon}$ by Gehring's lemma. A substantial part of the paper is also devoted to showing that both results stated above are optimal."

Here, we report on the fabrication of a (3.4 $\pm$ 0.2) {\mu}m thin, smooth (surface roughness r$_q$ < 0.4 nm over an area of 20 {\mu}m by 30 {\mu}m diamond membrane containing individually resolvable, narrow linewidth (< 100 MHz) NV centers. We fabricate this sample via a combination of high energy electron irradiation, high temperature annealing, and an optimized etching sequence found via a systematic study of the diamond surface evolution on the microscopic level in different etch chemistries. While our particular device dimensions are optimized for cavity-enhanced entanglement generation between distant NV centers in open, tuneable micro-cavities, our results have implications for a broad range of quantum experiments that require the combination of narrow optical transitions and {\mu}m-scale device geometry."

As it follows from the new derivation in the recent paper \cite{M19}, the vorticity is represented as a normal vector to the minimal surface not just at the edge, like it was assumed before, but all over the surface. As it was pointed in that paper, the self-consistency relation for mean vorticity leads to $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$, however the similar conditions for product of two and more vorticities cannot be satisfied without extra terms, which were left undetermined in that paper. In this paper we find these missing terms -- they are delta functions at coinciding points which must be taken into considerations in surface integrals. We compare this value of $\alpha$ with new measurements of the same team which confirmed the area law \cite{S19} and we find that asymptotic formula $\lambda(p) \approx 2 \alpha p + \beta \ln p$, with $\alpha =0.49 \pm 0.02, \beta= 0.92 \pm 0.01 $, fits all data at $p=3,...10$ within error bars."

We focus on gauge theories where the existence of a fermionic dark matter candidate is predicted by anomaly cancellation, its mass is defined by the new symmetry breaking scale, and its stability is guaranteed by a remnant symmetry after the breaking of the gauge symmetry. We find an upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale by applying the relic density and perturbative constraints. The anomaly-free property of the theories allows us to perform a full study of the gamma lines from dark matter annihilation. We investigate the correlation between predictions for final radiation processes and gamma lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the latter can be distinguished from the continuum gamma ray spectrum."

Unlike most existing approaches that are feature-based, our algorithm works on pixels directly, and accounts for errors across the whole images globally. Technically, we formulate the alignment problem as rank-1 and sparse matrix decomposition over transformed images, and develop an efficient algorithm for solving this challenging non-convex optimization problem. The algorithm reduces to solving a sequence of subproblems, where we analytically establish exact recovery conditions, convergence and optimality, together with convergence rate and complexity. We generalize it to simultaneously align multiple images and recover multiple homographies, extending its application scope towards vast majority of practical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of more accurately aligning the images and generating higher quality stitched images than state-of-the-art methods."

At first, we evaluated original cross sections for elastic scattering of neutrinos produced from various astrophysical and laboratory neutrino sources with the most abundant Cd isotopes $^{112}$Cd, $^{114}$Cd and $^{116}$Cd. These isotopes constitute the main material of the COBRA detector aiming to search for neutrinoless double beta decay events and neutrino-nucleus scattering events at the Gran Sasso laboratory (LNGS). The coherent $\nu$-nucleus reaction channel addressed with emphasis here, dominates the neutral current $\nu$-nucleus scattering, events of which have only recently been observed for a first time in the COHERENT experiment at Oak Ridge. Subsequently, simulated $\nu$-signals expected to be recorded at Cd detectors are derived through the application of modern simulation techniques and employment of reliable neutrino distributions of astrophysical $\nu$-sources (as the solar, supernova and Earth neutrinos), as well as laboratory neutrinos (like the reactor neutrinos, the neutrinos produced from pion-muon decay at rest and the $\beta$-beam neutrinos produced from the acceleration of radioactive isotopes at storage rings as e.g. at CERN)."

The cluster, which we designate as Sextans A-GC1, lies some 4.4 arcminutes ($\sim1.8$ kpc) to the SW of the galaxy centre and clearly resolves into stars in sub-arcsecond seeing ground-based imaging.We measure an integrated magnitude $V=18.04$, corresponding to an absolute magnitude, $M_{V,0} = -7.85$. This gives an inferred mass $M\sim$1.6$\times10^5~M\odot$, assuming a Kroupa IMF. An integrated spectrum of Sextans A-GC1 reveals a heliocentric radial velocity $v_{\rm helio}=305\pm15$~ km/s, consistent with the systemic velocity of Sextans A. The location of candidate red giant branch stars in the cluster, and stellar population analyses of the cluster's integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] $\sim$--2.4, and an age $\sim9$ Gyr. We measure a half light radius, $R_h = 7.6\pm0.2$ pc. Normalising to the galaxy integrated magnitude, we obtain a $V$-band specific frequency, $S_N=2.1$. We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1 is close to a ""metallicity floor"" at [Fe/H] $\sim-2.5$ seen in these globular cluster systems which include the Milky Way, M31, M87 and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This metallicity floor appears to hold across 6 dex in host galaxy stellar mass and is seen in galaxies with and without accreted GC subpopulations."

Here we reveal that circular dichroism of rotating optically-isotropic particles has an unexpectedly strong dependence on their internal geometry. In particular, nanorings and nanocrosses exhibit a splitting of $2\Omega$ in the particle optical resonances, while compact particles display weak circular dichroism at low rotation frequency $\Omega$, but a strong circular dichroism at high $\Omega$. We base our findings on a quantum-mechanical description of the polarizability of rotating particles, which has not been rigorously addressed so far. Specifically, we use the random-phase approximation and populate the particle electronic states according to the principle that they are thermally equilibrated in the rotating frame. We further provide insight into the rotational superradience effect and the ensuing optical gain, originating in population inversion as regarded from the lab frame, in which the particle is out of equilibrium. Surprisingly, we find the optical frequency cutoff for superradiance to deviate from the rotation frequency $\Omega$. Our results unveil a rich, unexplored phenomenology of light interaction with rotating objects."

These operators (which we will denote as $J^{\alpha },$ $\alpha >n$) are of the form (J^{\alpha })(x)=\mathcal{F}_{\xi \rightarrow x}^{-1}\left[ (\max\{1,||\xi ||_{p}\})^{-\alpha }\widehat{\varphi }(\xi )\right] ,\text{ } \varphi \in \mathcal{D}\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}),\text{ } x\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}. We show that the fundamental solution $Z(x,t)$ of the $p-$adic heat equation naturally associated to these operators satisfies $Z(x,t)<= 0,x\in\mathbb{Q} _{p}^{n},t>0. So this equation describes the cooling (or loss of heat) in a given region over time. Unlike the archimedean classical theory, although the operator symbol -J^{\alpha } is not a function negative definite, we show that the operator -J^{\alpha } satisfies the positive maximum principle on C_{0}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}). Moreover, we will show that the closure \overline{-J^{\alpha }} of the operator -J^{\alpha } is single-valued and generates a strongly continuous, positive, contraction semigroup {T(t)} on C_{0}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}). On the other hand, we will show that the operator -J^{\alpha } is m-dissipative and is the infinitesimal generator of a C_{0}-semigroup of contractions T(t), t>= 0, on L^{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}). The latter will allow us to show that for f\in L^{1}([0,T):L^{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n})), the function u(t)=T(t)u_{0}+\int\nolimits_{0}^{t}T(t-s)f(s)ds,\text{ \ \ }0<=t <=T, is the mild solution of the initial value problem \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,t)=-J^{\alpha }u(x,t)+f(t) & t>0\text{,\ } x\in \mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n} \\ u(x,0)=u_{0}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n})\text{.}"

Most of these results are related to those obtained by the authors in [IMRN (2016), 1054--1089], where the spectra of lens spaces were described in terms of the one-norm spectrum of a naturally associated congruence lattice. As a consequence, the first examples of Riemannian manifolds isospectral on $p$-forms for all $p$ but not strongly isospectral were constructed.   We also give a new elementary proof in the case of the spectrum on functions. In this proof, representation theory of compact Lie groups is avoided and replaced by the use of Molien's formula and a manipulation of the one-norm generating function associated to a congruence lattice. In the last four sections we present several recent results, open problems and conjectures on the subject."

The mainstream implementations of Lipschitz continuity include gradient penalty and spectral normalization. In this paper, we demonstrate that gradient penalty introduces undesired bias, while spectral normalization might be over restrictive. We accordingly propose a new method which is efficient and unbiased. Our experiments verify our analysis and show that the proposed method is able to achieve successful training in various situations where gradient penalty and spectral normalization fail."

As a result, when presented with an unknown class during testing, such closed-set assumption forces the model to classify it as one of the known classes. However, in a real world scenario, classification models are likely to encounter such examples. Hence, identifying those examples as unknown becomes critical to model performance. A potential solution to overcome this problem lies in a class of learning problems known as open-set recognition. It refers to the problem of identifying the unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on the known classes. In this paper, we propose an open-set recognition algorithm using class conditioned auto-encoders with novel training and testing methodology. In contrast to previous methods, training procedure is divided in two sub-tasks, 1. closed-set classification and, 2. open-set identification (i.e. identifying a class as known or unknown). Encoder learns the first task following the closed-set classification training pipeline, whereas decoder learns the second task by reconstructing conditioned on class identity. Furthermore, we model reconstruction errors using the Extreme Value Theory of statistical modeling to find the threshold for identifying known/unknown class samples. Experiments performed on multiple image classification datasets show proposed method performs significantly better than state of the art."

To this end, LiDAR sensor data can be incorporated to improve the visual image-based road detection, because LiDAR data is less susceptible to visual noises. However, the main difficulty in introducing LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection is that LiDAR data and its extracted features do not share the same space with the visual data and visual features. Such gaps in spaces may limit the benefits of LiDAR information for road detection. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel Progressive LiDAR Adaptation-aided Road Detection (PLARD) approach to adapt LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection and improve detection performance. In PLARD, progressive LiDAR adaptation consists of two subsequent modules: 1) data space adaptation, which transforms the LiDAR data to the visual data space to align with the perspective view by applying altitude difference-based transformation; and 2) feature space adaptation, which adapts LiDAR features to visual features through a cascaded fusion structure. Comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known KITTI road detection benchmark demonstrate that PLARD takes advantage of both the visual and LiDAR information, achieving much more robust road detection even in challenging urban scenes. In particular, PLARD outperforms other state-of-the-art road detection models and is currently top of the publicly accessible benchmark leader-board."

Assuming that tetragonal grains are present during the early stages of growth, matching plane analysis shows that tetragonal [100] grains can transform into orthorhombic [001] during thermal annealing, when they are laterally confined by other grains. We show that among 0%, 2% and %4 Si doping, 4% doping provides the best conditions for the tetragonal [100] to orthorhombic [001] transformation. This also holds for Al doping. We also show that for Hf$_{x}$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$, where we have studied ${x}=1.00,0.75,0.50,0.25,0.00$, the value ${x}=0.50$ provides the most favorable conditions for the desired transformation. In order for this transformation to be preferred over the tetragonal [100] to monoclinic [100] transformation, out-of-plane confinement also needs to be present, as supplied by a top electrode. Our findings illuminate the mechanism that causes ferroelectricity in hafnia-based films and provide an explanation for common experimental observations for the optimal ranges of doping in Si:HfO$_{2}$, Al:HfO$_{2}$ and Hf$_{x}$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$. We also present model thin film heterostructure computations of Ir/HfO$_{2}$/Ir stacks in order to isolate the interface effects, which we show to be significant."

To design an efficient tandem solar cell, two key issues need to be considered. Firstly, subcells with well-matched currents and complementary absorption characteristics are a prerequisite for high efficiency. Secondly identifying the appropriate intermediate layer (IML) to connect the subcells is necessary to minimize the optical and electronic losses. PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are a notable choice for the subcells due to their low cost, solution processibility and remarkable wide range band gap tunability. Single layer Graphene (Gr) has been proposed to be a promising IML due to its high transparency and conductivity. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate a solution processed two terminal PbS CQDs tandem solar cell employing chemical vapor deposited Gr as the IML. In doing so, we report a PbS CQD cell comprising subcells with bandgaps of 1.4 and 0.95 eV that delivers power conversion efficiency in excess of 7%, substantially higher than previously reported CQD tandem cells."

Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the predefined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection accuracy.

The network is trained to maximize a likelihood criterion derived from a spatial mixture model of the observations. It is trained from scratch without requiring any parallel data consisting of degraded input and clean training targets. Thus, training can be carried out on real recordings of noisy speech rather than simulated ones. In contrast to previous work on unsupervised training of neural mask estimators, our approach avoids the need for a possibly pre-trained teacher model entirely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by speech recognition experiments on two different datasets: one mainly deteriorated by noise (CHiME 4) and one by reverberation (REVERB). The results show that the performance of the proposed system is on par with a supervised system using oracle target masks for training and with a system trained using a model-based teacher."

In this work, we propose a simple yet robust approach for scene text recognition. With no need to convert input images to sequence representations, we directly connect two-dimensional CNN features to an attention-based sequence decoder. As no recurrent module is adopted, our model can be trained in parallel. It achieves 1.7x to 10x acceleration to backward pass and 1.4x to 9x acceleration to forward pass, compared with the RNN counterparts. The proposed model is trained with only word-level annotations.

Later on, the behaviour of transitive modal Lukasiewicz logic is compared with that of its non transitive counterpart, exhibiting some particulars concerning computability and equivalence with other logics.

The mHz band is ideally suited to exploring beyond standard model processes in the early universe, and with the sensitivities that can be reached with current technologies, the discovery space for exotic astrophysical systems is vast."

They follow close correlations with global properties of their host galaxies (scaling relations), and are thought to play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. Yet, we lack a complete understanding of fundamental aspects of their growth across cosmic time. In particular, we still do not understand: (1) whether black holes or their host galaxies grow faster and (2) what is the maximum mass that black holes can reach. The high angular resolution capability and sensitivity of 30-m class telescopes will revolutionize our understanding of the extreme end of the black hole and galaxy mass scale. With such facilities, we will be able to dynamically measure masses of the largest black holes and characterize galaxy properties out to redshift $z \sim 1.5$. Together with the evolution of black hole-galaxy scaling relations since $z \sim 1.5$, the maximum mass black hole will shed light on the main channels of black hole growth."

Others, on the contrary, have felt the need to break a lance in its defense by claiming that it should not be dismissed too quickly, but rather only reshaped to fit new needs. In this paper we argue that present pro or contra naturalness debates often miss an important historical point: that naturalness is essentially a hazily defined notion which, in the course of more than four decades, has been steadily, and often not coherently, shaped by its interplay with different branches of model-building in high-energy physics and cosmology on the one side, and new experimental results on the other side. The paper endeavours to clear up some of the physical and philosophical haze by taking a closer look back at the origin of naturalness in the 1970s and 1980s, with particular attention to the early work of Kenneth Wilson."

We compare both healthy cells to primary tumor cell and primary tumor cells to metastatic cancer cells, where tumor biopsies and normal tissues were isolated from the same individuals. To mimic analysis of liquid biopsies by flow cytometry, the cells were imaged while unattached to the substrate. We used low-coherence off-axis interferometric phase microscopy setup, which allows a single-exposure acquisition mode, and thus is suitable for quantitative imaging of dynamic cells during flow. After acquisition, the optical path delay maps of the cells were extracted, and used to calculate 15 parameters derived from cellular 3-D morphology and texture. Upon analyzing tens of cells in each group, we found high statistical significance in the difference between the groups in most of the parameters calculated, with the same trends for all statistically significant parameters. Furthermore, a specially designed machine learning algorithm, implemented on the phase map extracted features, classified the correct cell type (healthy/cancer/metastatic) with 81%-93% sensitivity and 81%-99% specificity. The quantitative phase imaging approach for liquid biopsies presented in this paper could be the basis for advanced techniques of staging freshly isolated live cancer cells in imaging flow cytometers."

Integrating out all the non-dynamical scalar fields of the model results in a coupling between the perturbations of the inflaton and of the CNI pseudo-scalar which is significantly greater than the one obtained in the absence of the gauge CNI dynamics. We compute how this greater coupling impacts the power spectrum of the inflaton perturbations that are sourced nonlinearly by the unstable (tensor) gauge CNI modes, and we require that the amplitude of these modes is well below that of the linear perturbations. Combining this result with various constraints, including backreaction effects, the requirement of having observable and dominant sourced gravitational waves (GW), and the current upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, significantly constrains the range of parameter space where this model can produce an interesting GW signal."

Despite the optical interface of NV center system, however, the significant attenuation of its zero-phonon-line photon in optical fiber prevents the network extended to long distances. Therefore a telecom-wavelength photon interface would be essential to reduce the photon loss in transporting quantum information. Here we propose an efficient scheme for coupling telecom photon to NV center ensembles mediated by rare-earth doped crystal. Specifically, we proposed protocols for high fidelity quantum state transfer and entanglement generation with parameters within reach of current technologies. Such an interface would bring new insights into future implementations of long-range quantum network with NV centers in diamond acting as quantum nodes."

It is based on virtual sinusoidal modulation of the light with frequencies in the MHz range. Phasor Field propagation was shown to be described by the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral. We extend this concept and stress the analogy between electric field and Phasor Field. We introduce Phasor Field optical elements and present experiments demonstrating the validity of the approach. Straightforward use of the Phasor Field concept in real-world applications is also discussed."

Some of their daily tasks require dual-arm manipulation skills in the rapidly changing, dynamic and unpredictable real-world environments where they have to operate. Given the expertise of humans in conducting these activities, it is natural to study humans' motions to use the resulting knowledge in robotic control. With this in mind, this work leverages human knowledge to formulate a more general, real-time, and less task-specific framework for dual-arm manipulation. The proposed framework is evaluated on the iCub humanoid robot and several synthetic experiments, by conducting a dual-arm pick-and-place task of a parcel in the presence of unexpected obstacles. Results suggest the suitability of the method towards robust and generalisable dual-arm manipulation."

The TRGB luminosity is typically measured in the I-band, where the luminosity has little dependency on stellar age or stellar metallicity. As the TRGB is brighter at wavelengths redder than the I-band, observational gains can be made if the TRGB luminosity can be robustly calibrated at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest given the infrared capabilities that will be available with the James Webb Space Telescope and an important calibration consideration for using TRGB distances as part of an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Here, we use simulated photometry to investigate the dependency of the TRGB luminosity on stellar age and metallicity as a function of wavelength (475 nm - 4.5 micron). We find intrinsic variations in the TRGB magnitude to increase from a few hundredths of a magnitude at 800-900 nm to ~0.6 mag by 1.5 micron. We show that variations at the longer infrared wavelengths can be reduced to 0.02-0.05 mag (1-2% accuracy in distance) with careful calibrations that account for changes in age and metal content. These represent the minimum uncertainties; observational uncertainties will be higher. Such calibration efforts may also provide independent constraints of the age and metallicity of stellar halos where TRGB distances are best measured. At 3.6 and 4.5 micron, the TRGB magnitude is predicted to vary up to ~0.15 mag even after corrections for stellar age and metallicity, making these wavelengths less suitable for precision distances."

This ansatz, based on exact matrix product states, captures the low-energy physics all along the transition and allows to probe its characteristic features. The transition is continuous, characterized by the decoupling of antisymmetric degrees of freedom. We futhermore determine the tunneling strength above which non-Abelian statistics should be observed experimentally. Finally, we propose to engineer the inter-layer tunneling to create an interface trapping a neutral chiral Majorana. We microscopically characterize such an interface using a slightly modified model wavefunction."

While linear polarisation of dust and molecular lines can give insight into the magnetic field structure, only observations of the circular polarisation produced by Zeeman splitting provide a direct measurement of magnetic field strenghts. One of the most promising probes of magnetic field strengths is the paramagnetic radical CN. Here we present the first Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the Zeeman splitting of CN in the disc of TW~Hya. The observations indicate an excellent polarisation performance of ALMA, but fail to detect significant polarisation. An analysis of eight individual CN hyperfine components as well as a stacking analysis of the strongest (non-blended) hyperfine components yields the most stringent limits obtained so far on the magnetic field strength in a proto-planetary disc. We find that the vertical component of the magnetic field $|B_z|<0.8$~mG ($1\sigma$ limit). We also provide a $1\sigma$ toroidal field strength limit of $<30$~mG. These limits rule out some of the earlier accretion disc models, but remain consistent with the most recent detailed models with efficient advection. We detect marginal linear polarisation from the dust continuum, but the almost purely toroidal geometry of the polarisation vectors implies that his is due to radiatively aligned grains."

This paper presents a path planning and path-following control solution that can be used to automatically plan and execute difficult parking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers by combining backward and forward motion. A lattice-based path planning framework is developed in order to generate kinematically feasible and collision-free paths and a path-following controller is designed to stabilize the lateral and angular path-following error states during path execution. To estimate the vehicle state needed for control, a nonlinear observer is developed which only utilizes information from sensors that are mounted on the car-like tractor, making the system independent of additional trailer sensors. The proposed path planning and path-following control framework is implemented on a full-scale test vehicle and results from simulations and real-world experiments are presented."

We first prove that, if the payoff function is convex and satisfies some regularity assumptions, then the option value function is increasing with respect to the volatility variable. Then, we focus on the standard put option and we extend to the Heston model some well known results in the Black and Scholes world, most by using probabilistic techniques. In particular, we study the exercise boundary, we prove the strict convexity of the value function in the continuation region, we extend to this model the early exercise premium formula and we prove a weak form of the smooth fit property."

Comparing with other theories, some interesting properties have been found or some problems existing in other theories could be solved in the GBD theory. For example, (1) the state parameter of geometrical dark energy in the GBD model can cross over the phantom boundary $w=-1$, without bearing the problems existing in the quintom model (e.g. the problem of negative kinetic term and the fine-tuning problem, etc); (2) $f(R)$ theory is equivalent to the BD theory with a potential (BDV) with the couple parameter $\omega=0$, where the kinetic term of field in the equivalent BDV theory is absent. While the scalar fields in the GBD own the non-disappeared kinetic term, when one compares the GBD theory with the $f(R)$ theory. In this paper, we continue to investigate the GBD theory. Using the method of the weak-field approximation, we explore the linearized physics in the GBD theory. The linearized equations of the gravitational field and two scalar fields are given. We investigate their solutions in the linearized theory for a point mass. It is shown that the problem of the $\gamma$ (parametrized post-Newtonian parameter) value in the $f(R)$ theory could be solved in the GBD theory, where the theoretical $\gamma$ value in the GBD theory can be consistent with the observational results. At last, we study the gravitational waves physics in the vacuum for the GBD theory. It is found that the gravitational radiation in the GBD theory has new freedoms beyond the two standard modes in the general relativity theory."

In this paper, we present Styler, a tool dedicated to fix formatting errors raised by Checkstyle, a highly configurable format checker for Java. To fix formatting errors in a given project, Styler 1) learns fixes for self-generated errors according to the project-specific Checkstyle ruleset, based on token sequence fed into a LSTM neural network, and then 2) predicts fixes. In an empirical evaluation, we find that Styler repairs 57% of 1504 real Checkstyle errors mined from five GitHub projects. Moreover, we compare Styler with the IntelliJ plugin CheckStyle-IDEA and the machine learning-based code formatters Naturalize and CodeBuff. We find that Styler fixes more Checkstyle errors, from more different Checkstyle rules, and generates smaller repairs compared to the other tools. The promising results suggest that Styler can be used in IDEs and in Continuous Integration environments to repair Checkstyle errors."

To recognise paired snapshots, it has to cope with large cross-view variations caused by the camera view shift. Supervised deep neural networks are effective in producing a set of non-linear projections that can transform cross-view images into a common feature space. However, they typically impose a symmetric architecture, yielding the network ill-conditioned on its optimisation. In this paper, we learn view-invariant subspace for person re-ID, and its corresponding similarity metric using an adversarial view adaptation approach. The main contribution is to learn coupled asymmetric mappings regarding view characteristics which are adversarially trained to address the view discrepancy by optimising the cross-entropy view confusion objective. To determine the similarity value, the network is empowered with a similarity discriminator to promote features that are highly discriminant in distinguishing positive and negative pairs. The other contribution includes an adaptive weighing on the most difficult samples to address the imbalance of within/between-identity pairs. Our approach achieves notable improved performance in comparison to state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets."

We lack a predictive model for how a star of a given mass explodes and what kind of remnant it leaves behind (i.e. the initial-final mass relation, IFMR). Progress has been limited due to the difficulty in finding and weighing black holes and neutron stars in large numbers. Technological advances that allow for sub-milliarcsecond astrometry in crowded fields have opened a new window for finding black holes and neutron stars: astrometric gravitational lensing. Finding and weighing a sample of compact objects with astrometric microlensing will allow us to place some of the first constraints on the present-day mass function of isolated black holes and neutron stars, their multiplicity, and their kick velocities. All of these are fundamental inputs into understanding the death phase of stellar evolution, improving supernovae models, and interpreting LIGO detections in an astrophysical context. To achieve these goals, we require large area surveys, such as the WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey, to photometrically identify long-duration (>120 day), un-blended microlensing events as candidate compact objects. We also require high-precision astrometric follow-up monitoring using extremely large telescopes, equipped with adaptive optics, such as TMT and GMT."

We first classify the irreducible modules of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-orbifold of the simple affine vertex operator algebra of type $A_1^{(1)}$ and determine their fusion rules. Then we study the representations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-orbifold of the parafermion vertex operator algebra $K(sl_2,k)$, we give the quantum dimensions, and more technically, fusion rules for the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-orbifold of the parafermion vertex operator algebra $K(sl_2,k)$ are completely determined."

Different from existing approaches using extensive annotated data for supervised learning, our CNN model is trained on large-scale unlabeled videos in an unsupervised manner. Our motivation is that a robust tracker should be effective in both the forward and backward predictions (i.e., the tracker can forward localize the target object in successive frames and backtrace to its initial position in the first frame). We build our framework on a Siamese correlation filter network, which is trained using unlabeled raw videos. Meanwhile, we propose a multiple-frame validation method and a cost-sensitive loss to facilitate unsupervised learning. Without bells and whistles, the proposed unsupervised tracker achieves the baseline accuracy of fully supervised trackers, which require complete and accurate labels during training. Furthermore, unsupervised framework exhibits a potential in leveraging unlabeled or weakly labeled data to further improve the tracking accuracy."

Hybrid qubit behaves as a charge qubit when the detuning is close to zero and as spin qubit for large detuning values. It is realized starting from an electrostatically defined double quantum dot where three electrons are confined and manipulated through only electrical tuning. By employing a three-level effective model for the qubit and describing the environment bath as a series of harmonic oscillators in the thermal equilibrium states, we extract the relaxation and decoherence times as a function of the bath spectral density and of the bath temperature using the Bloch-Redfield theory. For Si quantum dots the energy dispersion is strongly affected by the physics of the valley, i.e. the conduction band minima, so we also included the contribution of the valley excitations in our analysis. Our results offer fundamental information on the system decoherence properties when the unavoidable interaction with the environment is included and temperature effects are considered."

In adult animals under in vivo anaesthetised conditions (n=8-10/strain), respiratory modulation of splanchnic and renal nerve activity was compared under control conditions, and during peripheral (hypoxia), and central, chemoreceptor (hypercapnia) challenge.

An alternative scenario of production of 10Be (t1/2 =1.386 +- 0.016 million years (ref.9)) by neutrino process in a low mass star (11.8Msun) core collapse supernova has been recently suggested (ref. 10) that can explain the observed abundance of 10Be in the early Solar System. Here, we report well resolved excesses in 7Li/6Li of up to ~21.5 percent in a Type B1 Ca,-Al rich inclusion (CAI) from the Efremovka meteorite that correlate with 9Be/6Li, suggestive of in situ decay of 7Be. The in situ decay of 7Be, with characteristic half-life of 53.12+- 0.07 days (ref. 11) to 7Li, entails multiple episodes of enhanced irradiation in the ESS. The short half-life of 7Be limits its production by interaction of Solar energetic particles with the nebular gas and solids and provides constraints on genealogy and chronology of CAIs. Irradiation of precursor solids/gas of CAIs of Solar composition by a superflare (Lx=10 exp(32) erg/sec) during the terminal phase of class I or II of pre-main sequence stages of the Sun cogently explains the isotopic properties, distinctive petrographic features, and diffusivity constraints in the CAI."

In this paper we study the Betti numbers of $I^k$, for ideals $I$ with linear powers. The Betti numbers are computed explicitly, as polynomials in $k$, for the ideal generated by all square free monomials of degree $d$, for $d=2, 3$ or $n-1$, and the product of all ideals generated by $s$ variables, for $s=n-1$ or $n-2$. We also study the generators of the Rees ideal, for ideals with linear powers. Especially, we are interested in ideals for which the Rees ideal is generated by quadratic elements. This is related to a conjecture on matroids by White."

We find a large contribution from the nonradiative part of this correction, which has not been accounted for in previous investigations. The additional contribution shifts theoretical predictions for ionization energies by about 10$\,\sigma$. Despite this shift, we confirm the previously reported systematic deviations between measured experimental results and theoretical predictions for transitions involving $3D$ states. The reason for these deviations remains unknown."

Tracking and following suspicious objects is therefore required in real-time on limited hardware. With an object detector in the loop, low latency becomes extremely important. In this paper, we propose a solution to make object detection for UAVs both fast and super accurate. We propose a multi-dataset learning strategy yielding top eye-sky object detection accuracy. Our model generalizes well on unseen data and can cope with different flying heights, optically zoomed-in shots and different viewing angles. We apply optimization steps such that we achieve minimal latency on embedded on-board hardware by fusing layers, quantizing calculations to 16-bit floats and 8-bit integers, with negligible loss in accuracy. We validate on NVIDIA's Jetson TX2 and Jetson Xavier platforms where we achieve a speed-wise performance boost of more than 10x."

In these services, the client sends the query to the cloud server and receives the response in which case the query and response are revealed to the service provider. Such data disclosures are unacceptable in several scenarios due to the sensitivity of data and/or privacy laws.   In this paper, we introduce SANNS, a system for secure $k$-NNS that keeps client's query and the search result confidential. SANNS comprises two protocols: an optimized linear scan and a protocol based on a novel sublinear time clustering-based algorithm. We prove the security of both protocols in the standard semi-honest model. The protocols are built upon several state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives such as lattice-based additively homomorphic encryption, distributed oblivious RAM, and garbled circuits. We provide several contributions to each of these primitives which are applicable to other secure computation tasks. Both of our protocols rely on a new circuit for the approximate top-$k$ selection from $n$ numbers that is built from $O(n + k^2)$ comparators.   We have implemented our proposed system and performed extensive experimental results on four datasets in two different computation environments, demonstrating more than $18-31\times$ faster response time compared to optimally implemented protocols from the prior work. Moreover, SANNS is the first work that scales to the database of 10 million entries, pushing the limit by more than two orders of magnitude."

In this paper, we present an automated fact-checking platform which given a claim, it retrieves relevant textual evidence from a document collection, predicts whether each piece of evidence supports or refutes the claim, and returns a final verdict. We describe the architecture of the system and the user interface, focusing on the choices made to improve its user-friendliness and transparency. We conduct a user study of the fact-checking platform in a journalistic setting: we integrated it with a collection of news articles and provide an evaluation of the platform using feedback from journalists in their workflow. We found that the predictions of our platform were correct 58\% of the time, and 59\% of the returned evidence was relevant."

In contrast to the approach via labeled trees in the continuum random tree world, the genealogies are modeled as equivalence classes of ultrametric measure spaces, the elements of the space $\mathbb{U}$. This space is Polish and has a rich semigroup structure for the genealogy. We focus on the evolution of the genealogy in time and the large time asymptotics conditioned both on survival up to present time and on survival forever. We prove existence, uniqueness and Feller property of solutions of the martingale problem for this genealogy valued, i.e., $\mathbb{U}$-valued Feller diffusion. We give the precise relation to the time-inhomogeneous $\mathbb{U}_1$-valued Fleming-Viot process. The uniqueness is shown via Feynman-Kac duality with the distance matrix augmented Kingman coalescent. Using a semigroup operation on $\mathbb{U}$, called concatenation, together with the branching property we obtain a L{\'e}vy-Khintchine formula for $\mathbb{U}$-valued Feller diffusion and we determine explicitly the L{\'e}vy measure on $\mathbb{U}\setminus\{0\}$. From this we obtain for $h>0$ the decomposition into depth-$h$ subfamilies, a representation of the process as concatenation of a Cox point process of genealogies of single ancestor subfamilies. Furthermore, we will identify the $\mathbb{U}$-valued process conditioned to survive until a finite time $T$. We study long time asymptotics, such as generalized quasi-equilibrium and Kolmogorov-Yaglom limit law on the level of ultrametric measure spaces. We also obtain various representations of the long time limits."

Two relevant observing techniques: long baseline interferometry and adaptive optics fed high-contrast imaging produce data whose overall aspect is dominated by the phenomenon of diffraction. The proper interpretation of such data requires an understanding of the coherence properties of astrophysical sources, that is, the ability of light to produce interferences. This theory is used to describe high-contrast imaging in more details. The paper introduces the rationale for ideas such as apodization and coronagraphy and describes how they interact with adaptive optics. The incredible precision brought by the latest generation adaptive optics systems makes observations particularly sensitive to subtle instrumental biases that must be accounted for, up until now using post-processing techniques. The ability to directly measure the coherence of the light in the focal plane of high-contrast imaging instruments using focal-plane based wavefront control techniques will be the next step to further enhance our ability to directly detect extrasolar planets."

It goes beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation by including screening and excited state effects, and shares conceptual similarities with MP2 and RPA calculations. Because GW includes dynamics and time/frequency dependence of the system's screening and excited state behavior, a pivotal issue in any GW calculation is the question of how to numerically represent and manipulate time/frequency dependence. While earlier GW calculations generally used a representation in real time/frequency, many recent calculations have used a representation on the imaginary time axis. Imaginary time is important not only for numerics but also because it can enable additional physics such as systems where self-consistent GW is needed or that are strongly interacting, integration with DMFT, and scaling of GW to very large systems. This current text reviews the research literature on imaginary time GW codes and briefly discusses the possibilities for memory and CPU optimizations."

Here we demonstrate that the thermoelectric Hall conductivity $\alpha_{xy}$ in the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_5$ acquires a robust plateau in the extreme quantum limit of magnetic field. The plateau value is independent of the field strength, disorder strength, carrier concentration, or carrier sign. We explain this plateau theoretically and show that it is a unique signature of three-dimensional Dirac or Weyl electrons in the extreme quantum limit. We further find that other thermoelectric coefficients, such as the thermopower and Nernst coefficient, are greatly enhanced over their zero-field values even at relatively low fields."

Datasets typically used for evaluation include indoor and urban environments, where supporting videos have shown impressive performance. However, such techniques have not been fully evaluated in challenging conditions, such as the marine domain. In this paper, we compare ten recent open-source packages to provide insights on their performance and guidelines on addressing current challenges. Specifically, we selected direct methods and tightly-coupled optimization techniques that fuse camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data together. Experiments are conducted by testing all packages on datasets collected over the years with underwater robots in our laboratory. All the datasets are made available online."

We examined the characteristics of isolated intermediate drift bursts (IMDs) and their morphologies on dynamic spectra, in particular the positioning of emission and absorption ridges and the repetition rate of fiber groups. These were compared with a model in order to determine the conditions under which the IMDs appear and exhibit the above characteristics. Methods. We analyzed sixteen metric type IV events with embedded IMDs. The events were recorded with the Artemis-JLS/SAO high resolution (10 ms cadence) receiver in the 270-450MHz range with a frequency resolution of 1.4 MHz. We developed cross- and autocorrelation techniques to measure the duration, spectral width, and frequency drift of fiber bursts in 47 IMD groups. We also developed a semi-automatic algorithm to track fibers on dynamic spectra. Results. We distinguish six morphological groups of fibers, based on the relative position of the emission and absorption ridges. These included fibers with emission or absorption ridges only, fibers with the absorption ridge at lower or higher frequency than the emission, or with two absorption ridges above and below the emission or with two emission ridges were separated by an absorption ridge. Some borderline cases of IMDs with very high drift rate (~0.30 s-1) or very narrow total bandwidth (~8 MHz) were recorded; among them a group of rope-like IMDs with fast repetition rate and relatively narrow total frequency extent. The whistler hypothesis leads to reasonable magnetic field (~4.6 G), but the Alfven-wave hypothesis requires much higher field. We estimated the ratio of the whistler to the cyclotron frequency, x, to be ~ 0.3 to 0.6 and the average frequency scale along the loop of ~220Mm. We present empirical relations between fiber burst parameters and discuss their possible origin."

This paper aims to bridge the gap between abstract theoretical results and implementable algorithms, by developing a variational optimization framework for controlling infinite-dimensional stochastic models. A measure-theoretic approach is employed for systems evolving on Hilbert spaces, which relies on connections between relative entropy and free energy. The derived scheme is applicable to a wide class of problems, and can be used for optimizing parameterized control policies.

We find that regardless of the jet launching delay time, a structured jet with an angle-dependent luminosity and Lorentz factor is always formed after the jet breaks out the ejecta. On the other hand, the jet launching delay time has an impact on the jet structure. If the jet launching delay time is relatively long, e.g., $\ge 0.5$ s, the line-of-sight material has a dominant contribution from the cocoon. On the other hand, for a relatively short jet launching delay time, the jet penetrates through the ejecta early on and develops an angular structure afterward. The line-of-sight ejecta is dominated by the structured jet itself. We discuss the case of GW170817/GRB 170817A within the framework of both long and short $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$. Future more observations of GW/GRB associations can help to differentiate between these two scenarios."

While providing less information than microphones, blinkies circumvent some difficulties of microphone arrays in terms of manufacturing, synchronization, and deployment. The algorithm is derived from a joint probabilistic model of the microphone and sound power measurements. We assume the separated sources to follow a time-varying spherical Gaussian distribution, and the non-negative power measurement space-time matrix to have a low-rank structure. We show that alternating updates similar to those of independent vector analysis and Itakura-Saito non-negative matrix factorization decrease the negative log-likelihood of the joint distribution. The proposed algorithm is validated via numerical experiments. Its median separation performance is found to be up to 8 dB more than that of independent vector analysis, with significantly reduced variability."

Later this result was extended by Deconinck to generalized Fermat equations of the form $Ax^p +By^p +Cz^p = 0$, where A;B;C are odd integers belonging to a totally real field. Another extension was given by Sengun and Siksek. They showed that the Fermat equation holds asymptotically for imaginary quadratic number fields satisfying usual conjectures about modularity. In this work, combining their techniques we extend their results about the generalized Fermat equations to imaginary quadratic fields. More specifically we prove that the asymptotic generalized Fermat's Last Theorem holds for many quadratic imaginary number fields."

This algebraic structure is encoded by a two-colored operad introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman.

We start with a finite element discretization of the coupled problem, based on a remapping of the Navier-Stokes equation onto a fixed reference framework. The strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction problem is discretized with finite elements in time and finite differences in time. The resulting nonlinear and linear systems of equations are large and show a very high condition number. We present a novel Newton approach that is based on two essential ideas: First, a static condensation of solid deformation by exploiting the velocity-deformation relation $d_t u = v$. Second, the Jacobian of the fluid-structure interaction system is simplified by neglecting all derivatives with respect to the ALE deformation, an approximation that has shown to have little impact. The resulting system of equation decouples into a joint momentum equation and into two separated equations for the deformation fields in solid and fluid. Besides a reduction of the problem sizes, the approximation has a positive effect on the conditioning of the systems such that multigrid solvers with simple smoothers like a parallel Vanka-iteration can be applied. We demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting solver infrastructure on a well-studied 2d test-case and we also introduce a challenging 3d problem. For 3d problems we achieve a substantial acceleration as compared to established approaches found in literature."

This improves on the Ball-Rivoal theorem, that provides only $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+\log 2} \log a$ such irrational values -- but with a stronger property: they are linearly independent over the rationals.In the present paper we generalize this recent result to both $L$-functions of Dirichlet characters and Hurwitz zeta function. The strategy is different and less elementary: the construction is related to a Pad\'e approximation problem, and a generalization of Shidlovsky's lemma is used to apply Siegel's linear independence criterion. We also improve the analogue of the Ball-Rivoal theorem in this setting: we obtain $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+\log 2} \log a$ linearly independent values $L(f,s)$ with $s\leq a$ of a fixed parity, when $f$ is a Dirichlet character. The new point here is that the constant $1+\log 2$ does not depend on $f$."

While there are extensive frequentist and graphical methods for testing multivariate normality, it is challenging to find Bayesian counterparts. The proposed approach is based on the use of the Dirichlet process and Mahalanobis distance. More precisely, the Mahalanobis distance is employed as a good technique to transform the $m$-variate problem into a univariate problem. Then the Dirichlet process is used as a prior on the distribution of the Mahalanobis distance. The concentration of the distribution of the distance between the posterior process and the chi-square distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom is compared to the concentration of the distribution of the distance between the prior process and the chi-square distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom via a relative belief ratio. The distance between the Dirichlet process and the chi-square distribution is established based on the Anderson-Darling distance. Key theoretical results of the approach are derived. The procedure is illustrated through several examples, in which the proposed approach shows excellent performance."

In contrast to direct acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) images of such medium, obtaining its sub-region (s) like two-dimensional (2D) images or several small areas could be much feasible. Therefore, reconstructing whole images from the limited information is a primary technique in such cases. Specially, in practice the given data cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or partially informed, thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or even ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study we proposed a deep learning-based framework for reconstructing full image from its much smaller sub-area(s). Particularly, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is utilized to learn the mapping between input (partial image) and output (full image). To preserve the reconstruction accuracy, two simple but effective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two functions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Due to the inherent essence of this ill-posed problem, a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing reconstruction diversity, thus allowing for providing multiple candidate outputs. Extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and demonstrated by both visual inspection and quantitative comparison, the method is shown to be accurate, stable yet fast ($\sim0.08s$ for a $128 \times 128$ image reconstruction). We highlight that the proposed approach can be readily extended, such as incorporating any user-define conditional data and an arbitrary number of object functions into reconstruction, and being coupled with other reconstruction methods."

The ratio for charged $B$ mesons, $R_{K{^{\ast +}}}$, is the first measurement ever performed. The analysis is based on a data sample of $711~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, containing $772\times 10^{6}$ $B\bar B$ events, recorded at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider."

We compute the viscous dissipation resulting from tidal and libration forcing in the moon's subsurface ocean using the linearised Navier-Stokes equation in a 3-dimensional spherical model. We conclude that libration is the dominant cause of dissipation at the linear order, providing up to about 0.001 GW of heat to the ocean, which remains insufficient to explain the (about) 10 GW observed by Cassini. We also illustrate how resonances with inertial modes can significantly augment the dissipation. Our work is an extension to Rovira-Navarro et al. [2019] to include the effects of libration. The model developed here is readily applicable to the study of other moons and planets."

In predictive modeling, it is quite common to induce a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. For instance, doctors would like to know how effective some treatment will be for a patient or why the model suggested a particular medication for a patient exhibiting those symptoms? We acknowledge that the necessity for interpretability is a consequence of an incomplete formalisation of the problem, or more precisely of multiple meanings adhered to a particular concept. For certain problems, it is not enough to get the answer (what), the model also has to provide an explanation of how it came to that conclusion (why), because a correct prediction, only partially solves the original problem.

The experimentally accessible time resolution of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ is usually limited by the jitter of available single photon detectors. Here, we present a versatile technique allowing to measure $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ from a large variety of light signals with a time resolution given by the pulse length of a mode-locked laser. The technique is based on frequency upconversion in a nonlinear waveguide, and we analyze its properties and limitations by modeling the pulse propagation and the frequency conversion process .We measure $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ from various signals including light from a quantum emitter - a confined exciton-polariton structure - revealing its quantum signatures at a scale of a few picoseconds and demonstrating the capability of the technique."

This description is based on the construction of the universal $R$-matrix for the Yangian. To make the exposition self contained, we include the proofs of all necessary facts about the Yangian itself. In particular, we describe the centre of the Yangian by using its Hopf algebra structure, and provide a proof of the analogue of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for the Yangian based on its representation theory. This proof extends to the double Yangian, thus giving a description of its underlying vector space."

In order to support increased capacity requirement and to enable newer use cases, the next generation wireless systems will have a very dense deployment with advanced beam-forming capability. In such systems, providing a better mobility along with enhanced throughput performance requires an improved handover strategy. In this paper, we will detail a novel method for handover optimization in a 5G cellular network using reinforcement learning (RL). In contrast to the conventional method, we propose to control the handovers between base-stations (BSs) using a centralized RL agent. This agent handles the radio measurement reports from the UEs and choose appropriate handover actions in accordance with the RL framework to maximize a long-term utility. We also show that the handover mechanism can be posed as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. We analyze the performance of the methods using different propagation environment and compare the results with the traditional algorithms. Results indicate that a gain of about 0.3 to 0.7 dB for few practical propagation environments."

Learning Artistic Principles for   Aerial Cinematography,"Aerial filming is constantly gaining importance due to the recent advances in drone technology. It invites many intriguing, unsolved problems at the intersection of aesthetical and scientific challenges. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning agent which supervises motion planning of a filming drone by making desirable shot mode selections based on aesthetical values of video shots. Unlike most of the current state-of-the-art approaches that require explicit guidance by a human expert, our drone learns how to make favorable viewpoint selections by experience. We propose a learning scheme that exploits aesthetical features of retrospective shots in order to extract a desirable policy for better prospective shots. We train our agent in realistic AirSim simulations using both a hand-crafted reward function as well as reward from direct human input. We then deploy the same agent on a real DJI M210 drone in order to test the generalization capability of our approach to real world conditions. To evaluate the success of our approach in the end, we conduct a comprehensive user study in which participants rate the shot quality of our methods. Videos of the system in action can be seen at https://youtu.be/qmVw6mfyEmw."

This modality enables long range 3D reconstruction with high range precision and low laser power. A multispectral single-photon Lidar system provides additional spectral diversity, allowing the discrimination of different materials. However, the main drawback of such systems can be the long acquisition time needed to collect enough photons in each spectral band. In this work, we tackle this problem in two ways: first, we propose a Bayesian 3D reconstruction algorithm that is able to find multiple surfaces per pixel, using few photons, i.e., shorter acquisitions. In contrast to previous algorithms, the novel method processes the jointly all the spectral bands, obtaining better reconstructions using less photon detections. The proposed model promotes spatial correlation between neighbouring points within a given surface using spatial point processes. Secondly, we account for different spatial and spectral subsampling schemes, which reduce the total number of measurements, without significant degradation of the reconstruction performance. In this way, the total acquisition time, memory requirements and computational time can be significantly reduced. The experiments performed using both synthetic and real single-photon Lidar data demonstrate the advantages of tailored sampling schemes over random alternatives. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm yields better estimates than other existing methods for multi-surface reconstruction using multispectral Lidar data."

Interestingly, CMB fits to this model either pick out a specific large value of the neutrino interaction strength, or are consistent with the extremely weak neutrino interaction found in $\Lambda$CDM, resulting in a bimodal posterior distribution for the neutrino self-interaction cross section. In this paper, we explore why current cosmological data select this particular large neutrino self-interaction strength, and by consequence, disfavor intermediate values of the self-interaction cross section. We show how it is the $\ell \gtrsim 1000$ CMB temperature anisotropies, most recently measured by the Planck satellite, that produce this bimodality. We also establish that smaller scale temperature data, and improved polarization data measuring the temperature-polarization cross-correlation, will best constrain the neutrino self-interaction strength. We forecast that the upcoming Simons Observatory should be capable of distinguishing between the models."

Theoretical predictions and   topology-based data analysis,"We discuss the evaluation of the transition form factor (TFF) $F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2)$ by means of QCD theory and by state-space reconstruction from topological data analysis. We first calculate this quantity in terms of quark-gluon interactions using light cone sum rules (LCSRs). The spectral density includes radiative corrections in leading, next-to-leading, and next-to-next-to-leading-order of perturbative QCD. Besides, it takes into account the twist-four and twist-six terms. The hard-scattering part in the LCSR is convoluted with various pion distribution amplitudes with different morphologies in order to obtain a wide range of predictions for the form factor, including two-loop evolution which accounts for heavy-quark thresholds. We then use nonlinear time series analysis to extract information on the long-term $Q^2$ behavior of the measured scaled form factor in terms of state-space attractors embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These are reconstructed by applying the Packard-Takens method of delays to appropriate samplings of the data obtained in the CLEO, \textit{BABAR}, and Belle single-tagged $e^+e^- \to e^+e^-\pi^0$ experiments. The corresponding lag plots show an aggregation of states around the value $Q^2F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2) \approx 0.165\pm 0.005$ GeV pertaining to the momentum interval $Q^2\in [9-11]$~GeV$^2$. We argue that this attractor portrait is a transient precursor of a distribution of states peaking closer to the asymptotic limit $Q^2F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2\to \infty)=\sqrt{2}f_\pi$~GeV. More data with a regular increment of 1~GeV$^2$ in the range between 10 and 25~GeV$^2$ would be sufficient to faithfully determine the terminal portrait of the attractor."

Metasurfaces are artificially engineered 2D metamaterials with designed subwavelength-size building blocks, which allow precise control of optical fields with unparalleled flexibility and performance. The reduced dimensionality of optical metasurfaces enables new physics and leads to functionalities and applications that are remarkably different from those achievable with bulk materials.

The candidate was originally detected in data obtained jointly with the MASCARA and bRing instruments using a BLS search for transit events. Further photometry was taken by the 0.7 m CHAT, and radial velocity measurements with FIDEOS on the ESO 1.0 m Telescope. High resolution spectra during a transit were taken with CHIRON on the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope to target the Doppler shadow of the candidate. We confirm the existence of a hot Jupiter transiting the bright A3V star HD 85628, which we co-designate as MASCARA-4b and bRing-1b. It is in a 2.824 day orbit, with an estimated planet radius of $1.53 ^{0.07}_{0.04}$ $R_{\rm{Jup}}$ and an estimated planet mass of $3.1 \pm 0.9$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, putting it well within the planet mass regime.. The CHAT observations show a partial transit, reducing the probability that the transit was around a faint background star. The CHIRON observations show a clear Doppler shadow, implying that the transiting object is in a retrograde orbit with $|\lambda| = 247.5 \pm 1.6 $\textdegree. The planet orbits at at a distance of 0.047 $\pm$ 0.004 AU from the star and has a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 2100 $\pm$ 100 K. In addition, we find that HD 85628 has a previously unreported stellar companion star in the Gaia DR2 data demonstrating common proper motion and parallax at 4.3 arcsecond separation (projected separation $\sim$740 AU), and with absolute magnitude consistent with being a K/M dwarf."

Previous research on automated abusive language detection in Twitter has shown that community-based profiling of users is a promising technique for this task. However, existing approaches only capture shallow properties of online communities by modeling follower-following relationships. In contrast, working with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we present the first approach that captures not only the structure of online communities but also the linguistic behavior of the users within them. We show that such a heterogeneous graph-structured modeling of communities significantly advances the current state of the art in abusive language detection."

We also discuss the properties of the two new theoretical number density--voltage relationships that we employ. Moment uncertainties, which are calculated analytically via application of the \citet{Gershman2015} moment uncertainty framework, are used in Monte Carlo simulations to infer ranges of magnetospheric source population densities, temperatures, $\kappa$ values, and altitudes. We identify the most likely ranges of source parameters by requiring that the range of $\kappa$ values inferred from fitting experimental moment-voltage relationships correspond to the range of $\kappa$ values inferred from directly fitting observed electron distributions with two-dimensional kappa distribution functions. Observations in the first case study, which are made over $\sim$78--79$^\circ$ invariant latitude (ILAT) in the Northern Hemisphere and 4.5--5.5 magnetic local time (MLT), are consistent with a magnetospheric source population density $n_m =$~0.7--0.8~cm$^{-3}$, source temperature $T_m \approx$~70~eV, source altitude $h =$~6.4--7.7~$R_E$, and $\kappa =$~2.2--2.8. Observations in the second case study, which are made over 76--79$^\circ$~ILAT in the Southern Hemisphere and $\sim$21~MLT, are consistent with a magnetospheric source population density $n_m =$~0.07--0.09~cm$^{-3}$, source temperature $T_m \approx$~95~eV, source altitude $h \gtrsim$~6~$R_E$, and $\kappa =$~2--6."

To this end, we introduce a data augmentation technique that is able to reproduce the variability seen in a longitudinal training data set and simulate continuous biomarkers trajectories for any number of virtual patients. Thanks to this simulation framework, we propose to transform the training set into a simulated data set with more patients, more time-points per patient and longer follow-up duration. We illustrate this approach on the prediction of the MMSE of MCI subjects of the ADNI data set. We show that it allows to reach predictions with errors comparable to the noise in the data, estimated in test/retest studies, achieving a improvement of 37% of the mean absolute error compared to the same non-augmented model."

We study weak* continuity, convexity and G\^ateaux differentiability of the map $\rho\mapsto1/\lambda_1(\rho)$, where $\lambda_1(\rho)$ is the first positive eigenvalue. Moreover, denoting by $\mathcal{G}(\rho_0)$ the class of rearrangements of $\rho_0$, we prove the existence of a minimizer of $\lambda_1(\rho)$ when $\rho$ varies on $\mathcal{G}(\rho_0)$.

GEC models have been previously evaluated based on a single commonly applied corpus: the CoNLL-2014 benchmark. However, the evaluation remains incomplete because the task difficulty varies depending on the test corpus and conditions such as the proficiency levels of the writers and essay topics. To overcome this limitation, we evaluate the performance of several GEC models, including NMT-based (LSTM, CNN, and transformer) and an SMT-based model, against various learner corpora (CoNLL-2013, CoNLL-2014, FCE, JFLEG, ICNALE, and KJ). Evaluation results reveal that the models' rankings considerably vary depending on the corpus, indicating that single-corpus evaluation is insufficient for GEC models."

That has stimulated the study of a phenomenological theory combining synchronization and polar order in active matter. Here, we consider another example inspired by the traction forces of migrating cells. The novelty, in this case, is the global force-free nature of the traction force field. Such a constraint is absent in the case where the vector field describes swimming speeds in micro-organisms suspensions. Cell traction is characterized by means of a complex tensor quantity, that generalizes the nematic orientation tensor to incorporate the ability of particles to synchronize, and cell motility depends on this quantity being non-zero. We provide a realization of migrating cell which comprises an assembly of dipolar elements exerting traction on a fluid substrate. This model indicates that spontaneous transition to the motile state is possible but requires (as in the case of synchronization) non-isochrony of oscillations and involves subtle synchronization patterns, associated to propagation of waves. Such results are consistent with recent experimental work relating motility to the synchronization of actin oscillators at the periphery of migrating cells."

The PAF describes the attributable risk due to an exposure and is often interpreted as the proportion of preventable cases if the exposure could be extinct. Difficulties in the definition and interpretation of the PAF arise when the exposure of interest depends on time. Then, the definition of exposed and unexposed individuals is not straightforward. We propose dynamic prediction and landmarking to define and estimate a PAF in this data situation. Two estimands are discussed which are based on two hypothetical interventions that could prevent the exposure in different ways. Considering the first estimand, at each landmark the estimation problem is reduced to a time-independent setting. Then, estimation is simply performed by using a generalized-linear model accounting for the current exposure state and further (time-varying) covariates. The second estimand is based on counterfactual outcomes, estimation can be performed using pseudo-values or inverse-probability weights. The approach is explored in a simulation study and applied on two data examples. First, we study a large French database of intensive care unit patients to estimate the population-benefit of a pathogen-specific intervention that could prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, we quantify the population-attributable burden of locoregional and distant recurrence in breast cancer patients."

Concerning the information aggregation, a common practice is to use a concatenation followed by a linear transformation, which may not fully exploit the expressiveness of multi-head attention. In this work, we propose to improve the information aggregation for multi-head attention with a more powerful routing-by-agreement algorithm. Specifically, the routing algorithm iteratively updates the proportion of how much a part (i.e. the distinct information learned from a specific subspace) should be assigned to a whole (i.e. the final output representation), based on the agreement between parts and wholes. Experimental results on linguistic probing tasks and machine translation tasks prove the superiority of the advanced information aggregation over the standard linear transformation."

Although it is challenging to observationally determine the outflow velocities, we overcome this by using ALMA [CII]158 $\mu$m emission lines for systemic velocities and deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity profiles available to date. We construct a composite Keck spectrum of the galaxies at $z=$5-6 with the [CII]-systemic velocities, and fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in the composite spectrum. We measure the maximum (90%) and central outflow velocities to be $v_\rm{max}=700^{+180}_{-110}\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ and $v_\rm{out}= 400^{+100}_{-150}\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ on average, respectively, showing no significant differences between the outflow velocities derived with the low to high-ionization absorption lines. For $M_* \sim10^{10.1}\ \rm{M_\odot}$, we find that the $v_\rm{max}$ value of our $z=$5-6 galaxies is 3 times higher than those of $z\sim0$ galaxies and comparable to $z\sim2$ galaxies. Estimating the halo circular velocity $v_\rm{cir}$ from the stellar masses and the abundance matching results, we investigate a $v_\rm{max}$-$v_\rm{cir}$ relation. Interestingly, $v_\rm{max}$ for galaxies with $M_*=10^{10.0-10.8}\ \rm{M_\odot}$ shows a clear positive correlation with $v_\rm{cir}$ and/or the galaxy star formation rate over $z=$0-6 with a small scatter of $\simeq \pm 0.1$ dex, which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. This positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related to the halo circular velocity, and that the redshift evolution of $v_\rm{max}$ at fixed $M_*$ is explained by the increase in $v_\rm{cir}$ toward high redshift."

PoMo consists of more than 231K sentences with post-modifiers and associated facts extracted from Wikidata for around 57K unique entities.

Our results show there is large room for improvement in terms of both identifying relevant facts to include (knowing which claims are relevant gives a >20% improvement in BLEU score), and generating appropriate post-modifier text for the context (providing relevant claims is not sufficient for accurate generation). We conduct an error analysis that suggests promising directions for future research."

While the rich structural properties of such matrices have long been leveraged for algorithmic purposes, little is known about their impact on statistical estimation. In this work, we propose to view this structure as a shape constraint and study the problem of estimating a Monge matrix subject to additive random noise. More specifically, we establish the minimax rates of estimation of Monge and pre-Monge matrices. In the case of pre-Monge matrices, the minimax-optimal least-squares estimator is not efficiently computable, and we propose two efficient estimators and establish their rates of convergence. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments."

In addition to bulk electronic states we also find surface states in PtBi${}_{2}$ which is expected as PtBi${}_{2}$ was theoretical predicated to be a candidate Dirac semimetal. The surface states are also well reproduced from DFT band calculations. Interestingly, the topological surface states form Fermi contours rather than double Fermi arcs that were observed in Na$_3$Bi. The surface bands forming the Fermi contours merge with bulk bands in proximity of the Dirac points projections, as expected. Our data confirms existence of Dirac states in PtBi${}_{2}$ and reveals the fragility of the Fermi arcs in Dirac semimetals. Because the Fermi arcs are not topologically protected in general, they can be deformed into Fermi contours, as proposed by [Kargarian {\it et al.}, PNAS \textbf{113}, 8648 (2016)]. Our results demonstrate validity of this theory in PtBi${}_{2}$."

We find that the MIRO amplitude increases dramatically with carrier density. Our analysis shows that the anticipated increase in the effective microwave power and quantum lifetime with density is not sufficient to explain the observed growth of the amplitude. We further observe that the fundamental oscillation extrema move towards cyclotron resonance with increasing density, which also contradicts theoretical predictions. These findings reveal that the density dependence is not properly captured by existing theories, calling for further studies."

Moreover, if the dimension of $\mathfrak{X}$ is exactly $p$, then the full De Rham complex is decomposable.

More precisely, we show that perturbations of the critical front decay algebraically with rate $t^{-3/2}$ in a weighted $L^\infty$ space. Our proof relies on pointwise semigroup methods and utilizes in a crucial way that the faster decay rate $t^{-3/2}$ is a consequence of the lack of an embedded zero of the Evans function at the origin for the linearized problem around the critical front."

For monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, this field scale is substantial --tens of teslas or more-- due to heavy carrier masses and huge exciton binding energies. Here we report absorption spectroscopy of monolayer MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, and WS$_2$ in very high magnetic fields to 91~T. We follow the diamagnetic shifts and valley Zeeman splittings of not only the exciton's $1s$ ground state but also its excited $2s$, $3s$, ..., $ns$ Rydberg states. This provides a direct experimental measure of the effective (reduced) exciton masses and dielectric properties. Exciton binding energies, exciton radii, and free-particle bandgaps are also determined. The measured exciton masses are heavier than theoretically predicted, especially for Mo-based monolayers. These results provide essential and quantitative parameters for the rational design of opto-electronic van der Waals heterostructures incorporating 2D semiconductors."

The efficiency of acceleration depends on the coupling of the laser energy to the self-generated channel in the target. The accelerated proton beams demonstrate high level of collimation with achromatic angular divergence, and carry a significant amount of charge. For PW-class lasers, this acceleration regime provides favorable scaling of maximum ion energy with laser power for optimized interaction parameters. The mega Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by the laser-driven co-axial plasma structure in the target are prerequisite for accelerating protons to the energy of several hundred MeV."

However, from a data security perspective, the development of NDN-IoT raises several new authentication challenges. In particular, NDN-IoT authentication may require per-packet-level signatures, thus imposing intolerably high computational and time costs on the resource-poor IoT end devices. This paper proposes an effective solution by seamlessly integrating the lightweight and unforgeable physical-layer identity (PHY-ID) into the existing NDN signature scheme for the mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled NDN-IoT networks. The PHY-ID generation exploits the inherent signal-level device-specific radio-frequency imperfections of IoT devices, including the in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, and thereby avoids adding any implementation complexity to the constrained IoT devices. We derive the offline maximum entropy-based quantization rule and propose an online two-step authentication scheme to improve the accuracy of the authentication decision making. Consequently, a cooperative MEC device can securely execute the costly signing task on behalf of the authenticated IoT device in an optimal manner. The evaluation results demonstrate 1) elevated authentication time efficiency, 2) robustness to several impersonation attacks including the replay attack and the computation-based spoofing attack, and 3) increased differentiation rate and correct authentication probability by applying our integration design in MEC-enabled NDN-IoT networks."

It is found that, as the training noise becomes larger, LSTM learns to depend more on its autonomous dynamics than the noisy input data. As a result, LSTM trained on noisy data becomes less susceptible to the perturbation in the data, but has a longer relaxation timescale. On the other hand, when trained on noiseless data, LSTM becomes extremely sensitive to a small perturbation, but is able to adjusts to the changes in the input data."

One possibility is to assume a linear model for wakes, in which case detection approaches are based on transforms such as Radon and Hough. These express the bright (dark) lines as peak (trough) points in the transform domain. In this paper, ship wake detection is posed as an inverse problem, which the associated cost function including a sparsity enforcing penalty, i.e. the generalized minimax concave (GMC) function. Despite being a non-convex regularizer, the GMC penalty enforces the overall cost function to be convex. The proposed solution is based on a Bayesian formulation, whereby the point estimates are recovered using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. To quantify the performance of the proposed method, various types of SAR images are used, corresponding to TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1, and ALOS2. The performance of various priors in solving the proposed inverse problem is first studied by investigating the GMC along with the L1, Lp, nuclear and total variation (TV) norms. We show that the GMC achieves the best results and we subsequently study the merits of the corresponding method in comparison to two state-of-the-art approaches for ship wake detection. The results show that our proposed technique offers the best performance by achieving 80% success rate."

We give a comprehensive introduction to the KPZ universality class, a conjectured class of stochastic process with local interactions related to random growth processes in $1+1$ dimensions. We describe some of the characteristic properties of the KPZ universality class such as scaling exponents and limiting statistics. In particular, we aim to extract the characteristic properties of the KPZ universality class by understanding the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation by a special discrete approximation given by the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). The connection with the ASEP is very important as the process enjoys a rich integrability structure that leads to many exact formulas."

The spectra are calculated based on the exact long-time solutions of the single-photon emission and scattering processes in this system. We find that there exist some phonon sideband peaks in the spectra and there are some sub peaks around the phonon sideband peaks under proper parameter conditions. The correspondence between the spectral features and the optomechanical interactions is confirmed, and the optomechanical coupling strengths can be inferred by analyzing the resonance peaks and dips in the spectra."

In this work, we aim to segment brain MRI volumes. 3D convolution neural networks (CNN) such as 3D U-Net and V-Net employing 3D convolutions to capture the correlation between adjacent slices have achieved impressive segmentation results. However, these 3D CNN architectures come with high computational overheads due to multiple layers of 3D convolutions, which may make these models prohibitive for practical large-scale applications. To this end, we propose a highly efficient 3D CNN to achieve real-time dense volumetric segmentation. The network leverages the 3D multi-fiber unit which consists of an ensemble of lightweight 3D convolutional networks to significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, 3D dilated convolutions are used to build multi-scale feature representations. Extensive experimental results on the BraTS-2018 challenge dataset show that the proposed architecture greatly reduces computation cost while maintaining high accuracy for brain tumor segmentation.

Motivated by the positive concentrated and negative separated properties observed from category-wise supervised learning, we propose to utilize the instance-wise supervision to approximate these properties, which aims at learning data augmentation invariant and instance spread-out features. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel instance based softmax embedding method, which directly optimizes the `real' instance features on top of the softmax function. It achieves significantly faster learning speed and higher accuracy than all existing methods. The proposed method performs well for both seen and unseen testing categories with cosine similarity. It also achieves competitive performance even without pre-trained network over samples from fine-grained categories."

It remains challenging to build nodule detection deep learning models with good generalization performance due to unbalanced positive and negative samples. In order to overcome this problem and further improve state-of-the-art nodule detection methods, we develop a novel deep 3D convolutional neural network with an Encoder-Decoder structure in conjunction with a region proposal network. Particularly, we utilize a dynamically scaled cross entropy loss to reduce the false positive rate and combat the sample imbalance problem associated with nodule detection. We adopt the squeeze-and-excitation structure to learn effective image features and utilize inter-dependency information of different feature maps. We have validated our method based on publicly available CT scans with manually labelled ground-truth obtained from LIDC/IDRI dataset and its subset LUNA16 with thinner slices. Ablation studies and experimental results have demonstrated that our method could outperform state-of-the-art nodule detection methods by a large margin."

For example, the swimming of bacteria and spermatozoa as well as important physiological functions at organ-level, such as the cilia-induced motion of mucus in the lungs, or individual cell-level, such as actin filaments or microtubules, all employ flexible filaments moving in viscous fluids. As a result of fluid-structure interactions, a variety of nonlinear phenomena may arise in the dynamics of such moving flexible filaments. In this paper we derive the mathematical tools required to study filament-driven propulsion in the asymptotic limit of stiff filaments. Motion in the rigid limit leads to hydrodynamic loads which deform the filament and impact the filament propulsion. We first derive the general mathematical formulation and then apply it to the case of a helical filament, a situation relevant for the swimming of flagellated bacteria and for the transport of artificial, magnetically actuated motors. We find that, as a result of flexibility, the helical filament is either stretched or compressed (conforming previous studies) and its axis also bends, a new result which we interpret physically. We then explore and interpret the dependence of the perturbed propulsion speed due to the deformation on the relevant dimensionless dynamic and geometric parameters."

We show that the number of (decimal-based) SanD numbers less than $x$ grows as $c1\cdot x,$ where $c1 = 2/3,$ while the number of SanD primes less than $x$ grows as $c2\cdot x/\log^2{x},$ where $c2 = 3/4.$ Due to the quasi-fractal nature of the digital-sum function, convergence is both slow and erratic compared to twin primes, which, apart from the constant, have the same leading asymptotics."

The presence of noise or errors in the text transcriptions, in real life scenarios make the task more challenging. In this paper, we address the spoken language intent detection under noisy conditions imposed by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We propose to employ confusion2vec word feature representation to compensate for the errors made by ASR and to increase the robustness of the SLU system. The confusion2vec, motivated from human speech production and perception, models acoustic relationships between words in addition to the semantic and syntactic relations of words in human language. We hypothesize that ASR often makes errors relating to acoustically similar words, and the confusion2vec with inherent model of acoustic relationships between words is able to compensate for the errors. We demonstrate through experiments on the ATIS benchmark dataset, the robustness of the proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art results under noisy ASR conditions. Our system reduces classification error rate (CER) by 20.84% and improves robustness by 37.48% (lower CER degradation) relative to the previous state-of-the-art going from clean to noisy transcripts. Improvements are also demonstrated when training the intent detection models on noisy transcripts."

Frequency shifts as large as 11 MHz (45 ppm) are observed during a single Rabi oscillation. We attribute the frequency shifts to a ""dressing"" of the nutation by spin-spin interactions. A nonlinear semi-classical model which includes a temperature- and sample-geometry-dependent demagnetizing field reproduces experimental results. Because experiments are performed without a cavity, radiation damping -- the most common nonlinear interaction in magnetic resonance -- is negligible in our experiments."

This answers a folklore problem in rational homotopy theory, showing that the rational homotopy type of a space is determined by its associative dg algebra of rational cochains. We also show a Koszul dual statement, under an additional completeness hypothesis: two homotopy complete dg Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are quasi-isomorphic as associative dg algebras must themselves be quasi-isomorphic. The latter result applies in particular to nilpotent Lie algebras (not differential graded), in which case it says that two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as associative algebras must be isomorphic."

In contrast to the commonly used loss functions for speech enhancement such as the L2 loss, the VoiceID loss is based on the feedback from a speaker verification model to generate a ratio mask. The generated ratio mask is multiplied pointwise with the original spectrogram to filter out unnecessary components for speaker verification. In the experiments, we observed that the enhancement network, after training with the VoiceID loss, is able to ignore a substantial amount of time-frequency bins, such as those dominated by noise, for verification. The resulting model consistently improves the speaker verification system on both clean and noisy conditions."

The theory is formulated directly in terms of the density field, thus forgoing the need to define collective variables. It is illustrated by application to diffusion-limited nucleation of macromolecules in solution for both liquid-liquid separation and crystallization. Both involve nonclassical pathways with crystallization, in particular, proceeding by a two-step mechanism consisting of the formation of a dense-solution droplet followed by ordering originating at the core of the droplet. Furthermore, during the ordering, the free-energy surface shows shallow minima associated with the freezing of liquid into solid shells, which may shed light on the widely observed metastability of nanoscale clusters."

Based on these results we identify a new class of objects that we call \emph{Semi-Countable Sets}. As the name suggests these sets form a separate class of objects between countable and uncountable sets. In principle these objects are countable, but the information in the descriptions of the elements of the class grows faster than the information in the natural numbers that index them. Any characterization of the class in terms of natural numbers is fundamentally incomplete. Semi-countable sets define one-to-one injections into the set of natural numbers that can be computed in exponential time, but not in polynomial time. A characteristic semi-countable object is $\phi_{\Sigma}$ the set of all additions for all finite sets of natural numbers. The class $\phi_{\Sigma}$ codes the Subset Sum problem. This gives a natural and transparant analysis of the separation between the classes $P$ and $NP$."

We present a sequence-to-sequence-to-sequence autoencoder (SEQ^3), consisting of two chained encoder-decoder pairs, with words used as a sequence of discrete latent variables. We apply the proposed model to unsupervised abstractive sentence compression, where the first and last sequences are the input and reconstructed sentences, respectively, while the middle sequence is the compressed sentence. Constraining the length of the latent word sequences forces the model to distill important information from the input. A pretrained language model, acting as a prior over the latent sequences, encourages the compressed sentences to be human-readable. Continuous relaxations enable us to sample from categorical distributions, allowing gradient-based optimization, unlike alternatives that rely on reinforcement learning. The proposed model does not require parallel text-summary pairs, achieving promising results in unsupervised sentence compression on benchmark datasets."

Interactions between domains may lead to unexpected folding and misfolding phenomena. This study of human {\gamma}D-crystallin, a two-domain protein in the eye lens, revealed one such surprise: conformational catalysis of misfolding via intermolecular domain interface ''stealing''. An intermolecular interface between the more stable domains outcompetes the native intramolecular domain interface. Loss of the native interface in turn promotes misfolding and subsequent aggregation, especially in cataract-related {\gamma}D-crystallin variants. This phenomenon is likely a contributing factor in the development of cataract disease, the leading worldwide cause of blindness. However, interface stealing likely occurs in many proteins composed of two or more interacting domains."

The same switching gives a linear algebra explanation for the construction of a large number of non-isomorphic designs."

Here, we investigate the freezing process of NaCl solutions using a combination of x-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) for different salt-water concentrations, ranging from seawater conditions to saturation. A linear superposition model reproduces well the brine rejection due to hexagonal ice Ih formation and allows us to quantify the fraction of ice and brine. Furthermore, upon cooling at T = 233 K we observe the formation of NaCl$\cdot$2H$_2$O hydrates (hydrohalites), which coexist with ice Ih. MD simulations are utilized to model the formation of NaCl crystallites. From the simulations we estimate that the salinity of the newly produced ice is 0.5% mass percent (m/m) due to ion inclusions, which is within the salinity limits of fresh water. In addition, we show the effect of ions on the local ice structure using the tetrahedrality parameter and follow the crystalite formation by using the ion coordination parameter and cluster analysis."

The proposed theorem produces topologies of a type known as the coupled-ladder, which has been previously studied for only polynomial responses (e.g. Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.). A comparison between these topologies and another classical approach known as the economy bridge reveals that those proposed here have a number of theoretical and practical advantages. The theory is tested by the construction of a sixth-order, low-pass reflectionless filter exhibiting a pseudo-elliptic frequency response. Measured results are in excellent agreement with theory, and show return loss better than 20 dB throughout the pass-band, the transition-band, and up to two octaves into the stop-band."

One problem with current methods is that they require prior knowledge of the method of forgery in order to determine which features to extract from the image to localize the region of interest. When a machine learning algorithm is used to learn different types of tampering from a large set of various image types, with a large enough database we can easily classify which images are tampered (by training on the entire image feature map for each image). However, we still are left with the question of which features to train on, and how to localize the manipulation. To solve this, object detection networks such as Faster R-CNN, which combine an RPN (Region Proposal Network) with a CNN, have recently been adapted to fraud detection by utilizing their ability to propose bounding boxes for objects of interest to localize the tampering artifacts. By making use of the computational powers of today's GPUs this method also achieves a fast run-time and higher accuracy than the top current methods such as noise analysis, ELA (Error Level Analysis), or CFA (Color Filter Array). In this work, a multi-linear Faster RCNN network will be applied similarly but with the second stream having an input of the ELA JPEG compression level mask. This is shown to provide even higher accuracy by adding training features from the segmented image map to the network."

The learned dialog structure can shed light on how to analyze human dialogs, and more importantly contribute to the design and evaluation of dialog systems. We propose to extract dialog structures using a modified VRNN model with discrete latent vectors. Different from existing HMM-based models, our model is based on variational-autoencoder (VAE). Such model is able to capture more dynamics in dialogs beyond the surface forms of the language. We find that qualitatively, our method extracts meaningful dialog structure, and quantitatively, outperforms previous models on the ability to predict unseen data. We further evaluate the model's effectiveness in a downstream task, the dialog system building task. Experiments show that, by integrating the learned dialog structure into the reward function design, the model converges faster and to a better outcome in a reinforcement learning setting."

If the disc and the jet are connected, the jet variability may also contain a characteristic time-scale related to that of the disc-corona. Recent observations of the blazar Mrk 421 have confirmed the broken power law shape of the PSD of its jet X-ray variability. We model the time variability of a blazar, in which emitting particles are assumed to be accelerated by successive shock waves flowing down the jet with a varying inter-shock time-scale. We investigate the possible relation between the characteristic time-scales in the disc and jet variability based on the above model, along with mathematically and physically simulated disc variability. We find that both the PSD of the jet and disc variability may have a broken power law shape but the break time-scales are not related in general except only in systems with a small range of BH mass. The break in the jet and the disc PSD are connected to the interval between large amplitude outbursts in the jet (inter-shock time-scale) and to the viscous time-scale in the disc, respectively. In frequency bands where multiple emission processes are involved or emission is from lower energy particles, the break in the PSD may not be prominent enough for detection."

In the present letter, we investigated the longitudinal spatial coherence properties of the pseudo-thermal light source (PTS) as a function of spot size at the diffuser plane, which is controlled by translating microscope objective lens towards or away from the diffuser plane. The axial resolution of PTS is found to be maximum ~ 13 microns for the beam spot size of 3.5 mm at the diffuser plane. The change in the axial resolution of the system as the spot size is increased at the diffuser plane is further confirmed by performing experiments on standard gauge blocks of height difference of 15 microns. Thus, by appropriately choosing the beam spot size at the diffuser plane, any monochromatic laser light source depending on the biological window can be utilized to obtain high axial-resolution with large penetration depth and speckle-free tomographic images of multilayered biological specimens irrespective of the source temporal coherence length. In addition, PTS could be an attractive alternative light source for achieving high axial-resolution without needing chromatic aberration corrected optics and dispersion-compensation mechanism, unlike conventional setups."

Mrozek, J. Reiss, A. Szymczak. Construction of Symbolic Dynamics from Experimental Time Series, Physical Review Letters, 82 (1999), 1144-1147] is reshaped to improve its range of applicability, particularly in the presence of sparse data and strong expansion. The improvement is based on a multivalued map representation of the data. However, unlike the previous approach, it is not required that the representation has a continuous selector. Instead of a selector, a recently developed new version of Conley index theory for multivalued maps [B. Batko and M. Mrozek. Weak index pairs and the Conley index for discrete multivalued dynamical systems, SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems 15 (2016), 1143-1162], [B.Batko. Weak index pairs and the Conley index for discrete multivalued dynamical systems. Part II: properties of the Index, SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems 16 (2017), 1587-1617] is used in computations. The existence of a continuous, single-valued generator of the relevant dynamics is guaranteed in the vicinity of the graph of the multivalued map constructed from data. Some numerical examples based on time series derived from the iteration of H\'enon type maps are presented."

The zero-energy states appear in the junction when the superconductors induce a large energy shift in the nanowire, such that the junction naturally forms a quantum dot, a process that is highly tunable by the superconductor width. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the zero-energy states produce a $\pi$-shift in the phase-biased supercurrent, which can be used as a simple tool for their unambiguous detection, ruling out any Majorana-like interpretation."

However, learning the representation of rare words is a challenging problem causing the NLM to produce unreliable probability estimates. To address this problem, we propose a method to enrich representations of rare words in pre-trained NLM and consequently improve its probability estimation performance. The proposed method augments the word embedding matrices of pre-trained NLM while keeping other parameters unchanged. Specifically, our method updates the embedding vectors of rare words using embedding vectors of other semantically and syntactically similar words. To evaluate the proposed method, we enrich the rare street names in the pre-trained NLM and use it to rescore 100-best hypotheses output from the Singapore English speech recognition system. The enriched NLM reduces the word error rate by 6% relative and improves the recognition accuracy of the rare words by 16% absolute as compared to the baseline NLM."

It has surpassed human-level performance in fixed game environments and turn-based two player board games. However, to the best of our knowledge, current research has yet to produce a result that has surpassed human-level performance in modern complex fighting games. This is due to the inherent difficulties with real-time fighting games, including: vast action spaces, action dependencies, and imperfect information. We overcame these challenges and made 1v1 battle AI agents for the commercial game ""Blade & Soul"". The trained agents competed against five professional gamers and achieved a win rate of 62%. This paper presents a practical reinforcement learning method that includes a novel self-play curriculum and data skipping techniques. Through the curriculum, three different styles of agents were created by reward shaping and were trained against each other. Additionally, this paper suggests data skipping techniques that could increase data efficiency and facilitate explorations in vast spaces. Since our method can be generally applied to all two-player competitive games with vast action spaces, we anticipate its application to game development including level design and automated balancing."

Current label propagation algorithms cannot consistently yield satisfactory performance due to two reasons: one is the instability of single propagation method in dealing with various practical data, and the other one is the improper propagation sequence ignoring the labeling difficulties of different examples. To remedy above defects, this paper proposes a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid diffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically, HyDEnT integrates multiple propagation methods as base learners to fully exploit their individual wisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging results. More importantly, HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an ensemble of teachers. That is to say, in every propagation round the simplest curriculum examples are wisely designated by a teaching algorithm, so that their labels can be reliably and accurately decided by the learners. To optimally choose these simplest examples, every teacher in the ensemble should comprehensively consider the examples' difficulties from its own viewpoint, as well as the common knowledge shared by all the teachers. This is accomplished by a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the block coordinate descent method. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers, all the unlabeled examples are logically propagated from simple to difficult, leading to better propagation quality of HyDEnT than the existing methods."

Evolutionary optimization using simulations is a promising way to automatically design such control systems, however, if the disparity between simulation and the real world becomes too large, the optimization process may result in dysfunctional real-world behaviors. In this paper, we address this challenge by considering embodied phase coordination in the evolutionary optimization of a quadruped robot controller based on central pattern generators. With this method, leg phases, and indirectly also inter-leg coordination, are influenced by sensor feedback.By comparing two very similar control systems we gain insight into how the sensory feedback approach affects the evolved parameters of the control system, and how the performances differs in simulation, in transferal to the real world, and to different real-world environments. We show that evolution enables the design of a control system with embodied phase coordination which is more complex than previously seen approaches, and that this system is capable of controlling a real-world multi-jointed quadruped robot.The approach reduces the performance discrepancy between simulation and the real world, and displays robustness towards new environments."

Such parametrization occurs naturally in a wide range of applications. Striking examples are certain power management problems, which are modeled as metrical task systems with $m=2$. We characterize the competitive ratio in terms of the parameter $m$ for both deterministic and randomized algorithms on hierarchically separated trees. Our findings uncover a rich and unexpected picture that differs substantially from what is known or conjectured about the unparametrized versions of these problems. For metrical task systems, we show that deterministic algorithms do not exhibit any asymptotic gain beyond one-level trees (namely, uniform metric spaces), whereas randomized algorithms do not exhibit any asymptotic gain even for one-level trees. In contrast, the special case of metrical service systems (subset chasing) behaves very differently. Both deterministic and randomized algorithms exhibit gain, for $m$ sufficiently small compared to $n$, for any number of levels. Most significantly, they exhibit a large gain for uniform metric spaces and a smaller gain for two-level trees. Moreover, it turns out that in these cases (as well as in the case of metrical task systems for uniform metric spaces with $m$ being an absolute constant), deterministic algorithms are essentially as powerful as randomized algorithms. This is surprising and runs counter to the ubiquitous intuition/conjecture that, for most problems that can be modeled as metrical task systems, the randomized competitive ratio is polylogarithmic in the deterministic competitive ratio."

In all these contexts, a proper knowledge of the viscoelastic modulus is very important. However, the experimental characterization of the frequency dependent modulus, carried out through different standard procedures, still presents some complexities, then possible alternative approaches are desirable. For example, the experimental investigation of viscoelastic beam dynamics would be challenging, especially for the intrinsic simplicity of this kind of test. This is why, a deep understanding of damping mechanisms in viscoelastic beams results to be a quite important task to better predict their dynamics. With the aim to enlighten damping properties in such structures, an analytical study of the transversal vibrations of a viscoelastic beam is presented in this paper. Some dimensionless parameters are defined, depending on the material properties and the beam geometry, which enable to shrewdly design the beam dynamics. In this way, by properly tuning such disclosed parameters, for example the dimensionless beam length or a chosen material, it is possible to enhance or suppress some resonant peaks, one at a time or more simultaneously. This is a remarkable possibility to efficiently control damping in these structures, and the results presented in this paper may help in elucidating experimental procedures for the characterization of viscoelastic materials."

Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is rarely feasible in practice and approximation methods are usually employed, but do such methods preserve the generalization properties of Bayesian inference ? In this paper, we show that this is indeed the case for some variational inference (VI) algorithms. We consider a few existing online, tempered VI algorithms, as well as a new algorithm, and derive their generalization bounds. Our theoretical result relies on the convexity of the variational objective, but we argue that the result should hold more generally and present empirical evidence in support of this. Our work in this paper presents theoretical justifications in favor of online algorithms relying on approximate Bayesian methods."

Currently available tools ignore either the label relationship or the view complementary. Motivated by the success of the vector-valued function that constructs matrix-valued kernels to explore the multi-label structure in the output space, we introduce multi-view vector-valued manifold regularization (MV$\mathbf{^3}$MR) to integrate multiple features. MV$\mathbf{^3}$MR exploits the complementary property of different features and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features under the theme of manifold regularization. We conducted extensive experiments on two challenging, but popular datasets, PASCAL VOC' 07 (VOC) and MIR Flickr (MIR), and validated the effectiveness of the proposed MV$\mathbf{^3}$MR for image classification."

Ideally, such techniques should provide an atomistic definition of possibly many reaction pathways, because crude estimates may lead either to overestimating energy barriers, or inability to sample hidden energy barriers that are not captured by reaction pathway estimates. Here we provide an implementation of a new method [J. Rydzewski \& O. Valsson, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 150}, 221101 (2019)] dedicated entirely to sampling the reaction pathways of the ligand-protein dissociation process. The program, called \texttt{maze}, is implemented as an official module for PLUMED 2, an open source library for enhanced sampling in molecular systems, and comprises algorithms to find multiple heterogeneous reaction pathways of ligand unbinding from proteins during atomistic simulations. The \texttt{maze} module requires only a crystallographic structure to start a simulation, and does not depend on many \textit{ad hoc} parameters. The program is based on enhanced sampling and non-convex optimization methods. To present its applicability and flexibility, we provide several examples of ligand unbinding pathways along transient protein tunnels reconstructed by \texttt{maze} in a model ligand-protein system, and discuss the details of the implementation."

We propose a theoretical model of this phenomenon bringing together several different mechanisms previously considered only separately. We take into account the contribution of electron-electron interaction with the hybrid density functional theory, as well as the renormalization of energy spectrum due to the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we consider the presence of at least one point defect responsible for hole trapping and the formation of a localized polaron state. Our numerical simulations show that photoluminescence due to the recombination of a non-trapped electron and a trapped hole results in the giant Stokes shift in AgInS$_2$ nanocrystal, which is in close agreement with the recent experimental results."

Not Always: denoising policy gradient updates using   variance explained,"Policy gradient algorithms in reinforcement learning optimize the policy directly and rely on efficiently sampling an environment. However, while most sampling procedures are based solely on sampling the agent's policy, other measures directly accessible through these algorithms could be used to improve sampling before each policy update. Following this line of thoughts, we propose the use of SAUNA, a method where transitions are rejected from the gradient updates if they do not meet a particular criterion, and kept otherwise. This criterion, the fraction of variance explained $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$, is a measure of the discrepancy between a model and actual samples. In this work, $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$ is used to evaluate the impact each transition will have on learning: this criterion refines sampling and improves the policy gradient algorithm. In this paper: (a) We introduce and explore $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$, the criterion used for denoising policy gradient updates. (b) We conduct experiments across a variety of benchmark environments, including standard continuous control problems. Our results show better performance with SAUNA. (c) We investigate why $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$ provides a reliable assessment for the selection of samples that will positively impact learning. (d) We show how this criterion can work as a dynamic tool to adjust the ratio between exploration and exploitation."

In this paper, we examine the problem of transfer distance metric learning (DML), which usually aims to mitigate the label information deficiency issue in the target DML. Most of the current Transfer DML (TDML) methods are not applicable to the scenario where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) approaches can learn target distance metric by usually transforming the samples of source and target domain into a common subspace. However, these approaches lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations are often restricted to be linear. This motivates us to develop a general flexible heterogeneous TDML (HTDML) framework. In particular, any (linear/nonlinear) DML algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric beforehand. Then the pre-learned source metric is represented as a set of knowledge fragments to help target metric learning. We show how generalization error in the target domain could be reduced using the proposed transfer strategy, and develop novel algorithm to learn either linear or nonlinear target metric. Extensive experiments on various applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

For complex systems, the states of the maximum efficiency and the minimum entropy production are usually not equivalent. Here we show that the proper adjustments of the interaction between the energy and matter currents offer some important criteria for the performance characterizations of thermal agents, regardless of the system types and transition protocols. The universal thermodynamic coupling rule plays a critical role in irreversible processes. A double quantum dot system is applied to demonstrate that the performances of heat engines or refrigrators can be enhanced by suitably adjusting the coupling strength between thermodynamic fluxes."

The stability of four different atomic configurations of the Fe$_3$Si/GaAs multilayers is analyzed by calculating the formation energies and phonon dispersion curves. The differences in charge density, magnetization, and electronic density of states between the configurations are examined. Our calculations unveil that magnetic moments of the Fe atoms tend to align in a plane parallel to the interface, along the [110] direction of the Fe$_3$Si crystallographic unit cell. In some configurations, the spin polarization of interface layers is larger than that of bulk Fe$_3$Si. The effect of the interface on element-specific and layer-resolved phonon density of states is discussed. The Fe-partial phonon density of states measured for the Fe$_3$Si layer thickness of three monolayers is compared with theoretical results obtained for each interface atomic configuration. The best agreement is found for one of the configurations with a mixed Fe-Si interface layer, which reproduces the anomalous enhancement of the phonon density of states below 10 meV"

Production of particles, notably heavy flavour states, can be studied in p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies in the forward rapidity region (pseudorapidity between 2 and 5), providing measurements which are highly complementary to the other LHC experiments. Moreover, owing to its forward geometry, the detector is also well suited to study fixed-target collisions, obtained by impinging the LHC beams on gas targets with different mass numbers. In this configuration, p-A collisions can be studied at the relatively unexplored scale of sqrt(sNN) ~ 100 GeV, also providing valuable inputs to cosmic ray physics.

Taking the example of two different deep (3 hidden layers) classifiers for MNIST data, we find quite different $T$ values to be appropriate in each case. In particular, for a typical neural network classifier a clear minimum of the test error is observed at $T>0$. This suggests an early stopping criterion for full batch simulated annealing: cool until the average validation error starts to increase, then revert to the parameters with the lowest validation error. As $T$ is increased classifiers transition from accurate classifiers to classifiers that have higher training error than assigning equal probability to each class. Efficient studies of these temperature-induced effects are enabled using a replica-exchange Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation technique. Finally, we show how thermodynamic integration can be used to perform model selection for deep neural networks. Similar to the Laplace approximation, this approach assumes that the posterior is dominated by a single mode. Crucially, however, no assumption is made about the shape of that mode and it is not required to precisely compute and invert the Hessian."

One problem in this context arises from the need to define and label action boundaries to create annotations for training which is very time and cost intensive. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised approach for learning action classes from untrimmed video sequences. To this end, we use a continuous temporal embedding of framewise features to benefit from the sequential nature of activities. Based on the latent space created by the embedding, we identify clusters of temporal segments across all videos that correspond to semantic meaningful action classes. The approach is evaluated on three challenging datasets, namely the Breakfast dataset, YouTube Instructions, and the 50Salads dataset. While previous works assumed that the videos contain the same high level activity, we furthermore show that the proposed approach can also be applied to a more general setting where the content of the videos is unknown."

Indeed, it is relatively consistent with KM for any infinite $\lambda$ with $\omega\leq\lambda\leq\text{Ord}$ that there is a class function $F:\text{Ord}\to\lambda$ that is not constant on any stationary class. Strikingly, it is consistent with KM that there is a class $A\subseteq\omega\times\text{Ord}$, such that each section $A_n=\{\alpha\mid (n,\alpha)\in A\}$ contains a class club, but $\bigcap_n A_n$ is empty. Consequently, it is relatively consistent with KM that the class club filter is not $\sigma$-closed."

Of them, 6 (27%) are Compton Thick AGN candidates with column densities N$_{H}$$>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ while 15 are moderately obscured AGNs with 10$^{22}$ $<$ N$_{H}$ $<$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. Additionally, we estimate AGN contributions to the IR luminosity (8-1000$\mu$m rest-frame) greater than 20% for 19 DOGs based on SED decomposition using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m and the five Herschel bands (100-500 $\mu$m). Only 7 of these are detected in X-rays individually. We performed a X-ray stacking analysis for the 86 undetected DOGs. We find that the AGN fraction in DOGs increases with 24$\mu$m flux and that it is higher than that of the general 24$\mu$m population. However, no significant difference is found when considering only X-ray detections. This strongly motivates the combined use of X-ray and far-IR surveys to successfully probe a wider population of AGNs, particularly for the most obscured ones."

Our approach is direct in the sense that a single pair of corresponding local patches already provides the necessary transformation cue for the global registration. To achieve that, we first endow the state of the art PPF-FoldNet auto-encoder (AE) with a pose-variant sibling, where the discrepancy between the two leads to pose-specific descriptors. Based upon this, we introduce RelativeNet, a relative pose estimation network to assign correspondence-specific orientations to the keypoints, eliminating any local reference frame computations. Finally, we devise a simple yet effective hypothesize-and-verify algorithm to quickly use the predictions and align two point sets. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments suggests that our approach outperforms the state of the art in challenging real datasets of pairwise registration and that augmenting the keypoints with local pose information leads to better generalization and a dramatic speed-up."

Instead of utilizing raw EEG channel data, we compute the joint variability of the channels in the form of a covariance matrix that provide spatio-temporal representations of EEG. The networks are trained hierarchically and the extracted features are passed onto the next network hierarchy until the final classification. Using a publicly available EEG based speech imagery database we demonstrate around 23.45% improvement of accuracy over the baseline method. Our approach demonstrates the promise of a mixed DNN approach for complex spatial-temporal classification problems."

As a source of inspiration, insects are quite apt at searching for mates and tracking prey -- which always appear as small dim speckles in the visual field. The exquisite sensitivity of insects for small target motion, as revealed recently, is coming from a class of specific neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Although a few STMD-based models have been proposed, these existing models only use motion information for small target detection and cannot discriminate small targets from small-target-like background features (named as fake features). To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel visual system model (STMD+) for small target motion detection, which is composed of four subsystems -- ommatidia, motion pathway, contrast pathway and mushroom body. Compared to existing STMD-based models, the additional contrast pathway extracts directional contrast from luminance signals to eliminate false positive background motion. The directional contrast and the extracted motion information by the motion pathway are integrated in the mushroom body for small target discrimination. Extensive experiments showed the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed visual system model over existing STMD-based models against fake features."

However, existing approaches often use out-of-the-box sequence models which are limited by speed and memory consumption, are often infeasible for production environments, and usually do not incorporate cross-session information, which is crucial for effective recommendations. Here we propose Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks (HierTCN), a hierarchical deep learning architecture that makes dynamic recommendations based on users' sequential multi-session interactions with items. HierTCN is designed for web-scale systems with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users. It consists of two levels of models: The high-level model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to aggregate users' evolving long-term interests across different sessions, while the low-level model is implemented with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), utilizing both the long-term interests and the short-term interactions within sessions to predict the next interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on a public XING dataset and a large-scale Pinterest dataset that contains 6 million users with 1.6 billion interactions. We show that HierTCN is 2.5x faster than RNN-based models and uses 90% less data memory compared to TCN-based models. We further develop an effective data caching scheme and a queue-based mini-batch generator, enabling our model to be trained within 24 hours on a single GPU. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic recommendation methods, with up to 18% improvement in recall and 10% in mean reciprocal rank."

We present a quantum statistical model based on dynamical structure factors for the ionization potential depression, where quantum exchange and dynamical correlation effects in plasma environments are consistently and systematically taken into account in terms of the concept of self-energy. Under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the charge state distribution (or ionic fraction) characterized by the ionization balance is obtained by solving the coupled Saha equations. Calculations for the ionization potential depression of different chemical elements are performed with the electronic and ionic structure factors. The ionic structure factors are determined by solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation in combination with the hypernetted-chain equation. As a further application of our approach, we present results for the charge state distribution of aluminium plasmas at several temperatures and densities."

Space-borne photometry by the Kepler telescope provides unprecedented datasets to investigate these phenomena in Sun-like stars. We present a new analysis of the entire Kepler photometric time series of the moderately young Sun-like star Kepler-17 that is accompanied by a transiting hot Jupiter. We applied a maximum-entropy spot model to the long-cadence out-of-transit photometry of the target to derive maps of the starspot filling factor versus the longitude and the time. These maps are compared to the spots occulted during transits to validate our reconstruction and derive information on the latitudes of the starspots. We find two main active longitudes on the photosphere of Kepler-17, one of which has a lifetime of at least $\sim 1400$ days, although with a varying level of activity. The latitudinal differential rotation is of solar type, that is, with the equator rotating faster than the poles. We estimate a minimum relative amplitude $\Delta \Omega/ \Omega$ between $\sim 0.08 \pm 0.05$ and $0.14 \pm 0.05$, our determination being affected by the finite lifetime of individual starspots and depending on the adopted spot model parameters. We find marginal evidence of a short-term intermittent activity cycle of $\sim 48$ days and an indication of a longer cycle of $400-600$ days characterized by an equatorward migration of the mean latitude of the spots as in the Sun. The rotation of Kepler-17 is likely to be significantly affected by the tides raised by its massive close-by planet. We confirm the reliability of maximum-entropy spot models to map starspots in young active stars and characterize the activity and differential rotation of this young Sun-like planetary host."

We show the inspired inflation model is well consistent with current observations and will be probed further by future experiments. Furthermore, we clarify and prove the stability of Weyl gauge boson in the general theory with multiple scalars.

Recent wide-area and high-sensitivity polarization observations have drawn attention to the challenges of modeling magnetic field structure of star forming regions, due to variations in dust polarization properties in the interstellar medium. However, these observations also for the first time provide sufficient information to begin to break the degeneracy between polarization efficiency variations and depolarization due to magnetic field sub-beam structure, and thus to accurately infer magnetic field properties in the star-forming interstellar medium. In this article we discuss submillimeter and far-infrared polarization observations of star-forming regions made with single-dish instruments. We summarize past, present and forthcoming single-dish instrumentation, and discuss techniques which have been developed or proposed to interpret polarization observations, both in order to infer the morphology and strength of the magnetic field, and in order to determine the environments in which dust polarization observations reliably trace the magnetic field. We review recent polarimetric observations of molecular clouds, filaments, and starless and protostellar cores, and discuss how the application of the full range of modern analysis techniques to recent observations will advance our understanding of the role played by the magnetic field in the early stages of star formation."

Radiative momentum has been a controversial subject for decades. The momentum of isotropic noise is intuitively expected to be zero. We formulate the general features of the isotropic noise such as equipartition of energy and the vanishing of integrated Poynting vector. We demonstrate that in bi-anisotropic materials, a finite radiative momentum persists that performs work on the matter when its parameters change slowly. We find that Faraday rotation in the scattering of the radiative noise induces an angular momentum along the applied external magnetic field. Also, a Poynting vector starts circulating around the matter, raising the question whether it really describes the energy flow. These effects are small and hard to measure in any real experiment. Yet, they are surprising predictions of the classical, macroscopic Maxwell equations, and make contact with the outcome of recent QED calculations done for the quantum vacuum."

It was developed and is maintained by the Boltzmann-Zuse Society for Computational Molecular Engineering (BZS). The set of molecular models in the MolMod database provides a coherent framework for molecular simulations of fluids. The molecular models in the MolMod database consist of Lennard-Jones interaction sites, point charges, and point dipoles and quadrupoles, which can be equivalently represented by multiple point charges. The force fields can be exported as input files for the simulation programs ms2 and ls1 mardyn, Gromacs, and LAMMPS. To characterise the semantics associated with the numerical database content, a force-field nomenclature is introduced that can also be used in other contexts in materials modelling at the atomistic and mesoscopic levels. The models of the pure substances that are included in the data base were generally optimised such as to yield good representations of experimental data of the vapour-liquid equilibrium with a focus on the vapour pressure and the saturated liquid density. In many cases, the models also yield good predictions of caloric, transport, and interfacial properties of the pure fluids. For all models, references to the original works in which they were developed are provided. The models can be used straightforwardly for predictions of properties of fluid mixtures using established combination rules. Input errors are a major source of errors in simulations. The MolMod database contributes to reducing such errors."

Compared to conventional ESNs, the physics-informed ESNs are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while ensuring that their predictions do not violate physical laws. This is achieved by introducing an additional loss function during the training of the ESNs, which penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional training data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system, where the physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two Lyapunov times as compared to conventional ESNs. The proposed framework shows the potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge to improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems."

In particular, features and concept instances are put into context. This may help with understanding or implementing a similar model. The paper suggests that features are in fact the wiring. With this idea, the actual length of the connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron synchronization. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that link features and concept instances are the signals from those groups. Therefore, features become the static framework of the interconnected neural system and concepts are combinations of these, as determined by the external stimulus and the neural synaptic strengths. Along with this statistical model, it is possible to propose a simplified design for a neuron, based on an action potential and variable output signal. A strong comparison with Hebbian theory is then proposed, with some test results to support the theory."

On the basis of the concept that `Bayesian deep learning knows what it does not know,' the uncertainty of DNN outputs has been investigated as a reliability measure for the classification and regression tasks. However, in the image-caption retrieval task, well-known samples are not always easy-to-retrieve samples. This study investigates two aspects of image-caption embedding-and-retrieval systems. On one hand, we quantify feature uncertainty by considering image-caption embedding as a regression task, and use it for model averaging, which can improve the retrieval performance. On the other hand, we further quantify posterior uncertainty by considering the retrieval as a classification task, and use it as a reliability measure, which can greatly improve the retrieval performance by rejecting uncertain queries. The consistent performance of two uncertainty measures is observed with different datasets (MS COCO and Flickr30k), different deep learning architectures (dropout and batch normalization), and different similarity functions."

We propose and analyze a distributed primal-dual gradient-free algorithm for this challenging problem. We show that by appropriately choosing the parameters, the proposed algorithm converges to the set of first order stationary solutions with a provable global sublinear convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for optimizing nonconvex and nonsmooth problems over a network."

However, physical systems that can host these exotic excitations are rare and hard to realize in experiments. Here we study the domain walls and the edge states formed in spin transitions in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Effective theory approach and exact diagonalization in a disk and torus geometries proves the existence of the counter-propagating edge modes with opposite spin polarizations at the boundary between the two neighboring regions of the two-dimensional electron liquid in spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized phases. By analytical and numerical analysis, we argue that these systems can host parafermions when coupled to an s-wave superconductor and are experimentally feasible. We investigate settings based on $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$, $\nu=\frac{4}{3}$ and $\nu=\frac{5}{3}$ spin transitions and analyze spin-flipping interactions that hybridize counter-propagating modes.

The unique device geometry allows the interactions between edge-states to be probed at both electrostatic edges defined by pn junctions and at the graphene physical edge. Measurements show that while the lowest LL edge-state is decoupled from the other LLs along the electrostatic junction, all the edge-states strongly equilibrate at the graphene physical edge despite the relatively short distance that they travel along the edge in our device. These findings are fundamental for the engineering of future high-performance graphene field-effect transistors based upon electron optics."

The situation may be improved with a proper UV completion of the model. A well-defined self-consistent way is to introduce an $R^2$-term into the action. In this modified model the strong coupling scale returns back to the Planck scale, which justifies the use of the perturbative methods in studies of the model dynamics after inflation. We investigate the reheating of the post-inflationary Universe, which involves two highly anharmonic oscillators strongly interacting with each other: homogeneous Higgs field and scalaron. We observe that in interesting regions of model parameter space these oscillations make longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons tachyonic, triggering instant preheating at timescales much shorter than the Hubble time. The weak gauge bosons are heavy and decay promptly into light Standard Model particles, ensuring the onset of the radiation domination era right after inflation."

Increasingly, energy storage is being deployed alongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency. However, a formal characterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with storage is lacking in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap. We use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability (LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an uncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the fundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the storage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we present a case study using real-world wind power data to demonstrate the applicability of our results in practice."

While it is well known that BMA accounts for the additional uncertainty of the model itself, we show that it also decreases the posterior variance of the prediction errors via an explicit decomposition. We extend BMA to the situation where the competing models are defined on non-identical study regions. Any model's local forecasting difficulty is offset by predictions obtained from the average model, thus extending individual models to the full domain. We illustrate our methodology via pedagogical simulations and applications to forecasting nuclear observables, which exhibit convincing improvements in both the BMA prediction error and empirical coverage probabilities."

This enables the brain to process visual information from the eyes efficiently. Taking inspiration from biology, artificial spiking neural networks coupled with silicon retinas attempt to model these computations. Recent findings in machine learning allowed the derivation of a family of powerful synaptic plasticity rules approximating backpropagation for spiking networks. Are these rules capable of processing real-world visual sensory data? In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Event-Driven Random Back-Propagation (eRBP) at learning representations from event streams provided by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). First, we show that eRBP matches state-of-the-art performance on the DvsGesture dataset with the addition of a simple covert attention mechanism. By remapping visual receptive fields relatively to the center of the motion, this attention mechanism provides translation invariance at low computational cost compared to convolutions. Second, we successfully integrate eRBP in a real robotic setup, where a robotic arm grasps objects according to detected visual affordances. In this setup, visual information is actively sensed by a DVS mounted on a robotic head performing microsaccadic eye movements. We show that our method classifies affordances within 100ms after microsaccade onset, which is comparable to human performance reported in behavioral study. Our results suggest that advances in neuromorphic technology and plasticity rules enable the development of autonomous robots operating at high speed and low energy consumption."

Compared to the fully device-independent model, our scheme requires an extra natural assumption, namely that the mean energy per signal is bounded. The scheme is self-testing, as it allows the user to verify in real-time the correct functioning of the setup, hence guaranteeing the continuous generation of certified random bits. Based on a prepare-and-measure setup, our scheme is practical, and we implement it using only off-the-shelf optical components. The randomness generation rate is 1.25 Mbits/s, comparable to commercial solutions. Overall, we believe that this scheme achieves a promising trade-off between the required assumptions, ease-of-implementation and performance."

In this work, we revisit this paradigm through a careful study on how different samples contribute to the overall performance measured in terms of mAP. Our study suggests that the samples in each mini-batch are neither independent nor equally important, and therefore a better classifier on average does not necessarily mean higher mAP. Motivated by this study, we propose the notion of Prime Samples, those that play a key role in driving the detection performance. We further develop a simple yet effective sampling and learning strategy called PrIme Sample Attention (PISA) that directs the focus of the training process towards such samples. Our experiments demonstrate that it is often more effective to focus on prime samples than hard samples when training a detector. Particularly, On the MSCOCO dataset, PISA outperforms the random sampling baseline and hard mining schemes, e.g., OHEM and Focal Loss, consistently by around 2% on both single-stage and two-stage detectors, even with a strong backbone ResNeXt-101."

Dense material has also been detected around the Centaur Chiron, although its nature is debated. This is the first time ever that rings are observed elsewhere than around the giant planets, suggesting that those features are more common than previously thought. The origins of those rings remain unclear. In particular, it is not known if the same generic process can explain the presence of material around Chariklo, Chiron, Haumea, or if each object has a very different history. Nonetheless, a specific aspect of small bodies is that they may possess a non-axisymmetric shape (topographic features and or elongation) that are essentially absent in giant planets. This creates strong resonances between the spin rate of the object and the mean motion of ring particles. In particular, Lindblad-type resonances tend to clear the region around the corotation (or synchronous) orbit, where the particles orbital period matches that of the body. Whatever the origin of the ring is, modest topographic features or elongations of Chariklo and Haumea explain why their rings should be found beyond the outermost 1/2 resonance, where the particles complete one revolution while the body completes two rotations. Comparison of the resonant locations relative to the Roche limit of the body shows that fast rotators are favored for being surrounded by rings. We discuss in more details the phase portraits of the 1/2 and 1/3 resonances, and the consequences of a ring presence on satellite formation."

Sufficiently large magnetic fields can overcome the effects of disorder, leading to a weakly pinned collective mode called the magnetophonon. Consequently, in this regime it is possible to develop a tightly constrained hydrodynamic theory of pinned magnetophonons. The behavior of the magnetophonon resonance across thermal and quantum melting transitions has been experimentally characterized in two-dimensional electron systems. Applying our theory to these transitions we explain several key features of the data: (i) violation of the Fukuyama-Lee sum rule as the transition is approached is directly tied to the non-Lorentzian form taken by the resonance and (ii) the non-Lorentzian shape is caused by characteristic dissipative channels that become especially important close to melting: proliferating dislocations and uncondensed charge carriers."

Since 2004, an enhanced probability of $\gamma$-decay with $\gamma$-ray energies below $\approx2 - 4$ MeV has been measured in reaction data for numerous nuclei. This has been observed as an increase in the $\gamma$-ray strength with decreasing $\gamma$-ray energy, often referred to as the low-energy enhancement or \textit{upbend} in the $\gamma$-ray strength. Nevertheless, the available data confirming this enhancement corresponded solely to charged-particle included reactions and no low-energy enhancement had yet been confirmed from neutron-induced reaction measurements. In this work, we present the first evidence of low-energy $\gamma$-ray strength enhancement from neutron-capture reaction data. Gamma-ray spectra following thermal neutron capture on $^{58,60}$Ni have been used to determine the strength for primary and secondary $\gamma$-rays in $^{59,61}$Ni, showing an enhancement for $\gamma$-ray energies below $\approx 3$ MeV and $\approx 2$ MeV for $^{59,61}$Ni, respectively. For the first time, this enhancement is observed down to $\gamma$-ray energies of $\approx0.2$ MeV. Further, available spin-parity assignments have been used to obtain the multipolarity and electromagnetic character of these transitions, showing that this low-energy enhancement is dominated by $M1$ and $E2$ strength, with $E1$ strength also exceeding Standard Lorentzian Model predictions. Finally, large-basis shell-model calculations have been performed, also predicting a strong $M1$ enhancement at low $\gamma$-ray energies."

Due to the presence of light atoms (e.g., H or D), nuclear quantum fluctuations lead to observable changes in the structural properties of liquid water (e.g., isotope effects), and therefore provide yet another challenge for $ab$ $initio$ approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that the combination of dispersion-inclusive hybrid density functional theory (DFT), the Feynman discretized path-integral (PI) approach, and machine learning (ML) constitutes a versatile $ab$ $initio$ based framework that enables extensive sampling of both thermal and nuclear quantum fluctuations on a quite accurate underlying PES. In particular, we employ the recently developed deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) model---a neural-network representation of the $ab$ $initio$ PES---in conjunction with a PI approach based on the generalized Langevin equation (PIGLET) to investigate how isotope effects influence the structural properties of ambient liquid H$_2$O and D$_2$O. Through a detailed analysis of the interference differential cross sections as well as several radial and angular distribution functions, we demonstrate that this approach can furnish a semi-quantitative prediction of these subtle isotope effects."

This work consists of five chapters. In the first one, we summarize the most important notions and results from the theory of functional equations. In Chapter 2 we collect all the definitions and results regarding derivations that are essential while studying this area.   In Chapter 3 we intend to show that derivations can be characterized by one single functional equation. More exactly, we study here the following problem. Let $Q$ be a commutative ring and let $P$ be a subring of $Q$. Let $\lambda, \mu\in Q\setminus\left\{0\right\}$ be arbitrary, $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$ be a function and consider the equation \[ \lambda\left[f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)\right]+ \mu\left[f(xy)-xf(y)-yf(x)\right]=0 \quad \left(x, y\in P\right). \] In this chapter it will be proved that under some assumptions on the rings $P$ and $Q$, derivations can be characterized via the above equation.   Chapter 4 is devoted to the additive solvability of a system of functional equations. Moreover, the linear dependence and independence of the additive solutions $d_{0},d_{1},\dots,d_{n} \colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ of the above system of equations is characterized.   Finally, the closing chapter deals with the following problem. Assume that $\xi\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a given differentiable function and for the additive function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, the mapping \[   \varphi(x)=f\left(\xi(x)\right)-\xi'(x)f(x) \] fulfills some regularity condition on its domain. Is it true that in such a case $f$ is a sum of a derivation and a linear function?"

However, the electrophysiological signatures of top-down predictions are not clear yet. Here, we cued subjects to expect a certain perceptual state in a binocular rivalry task and quantitatively analyzed their EEG signals during the cue period and prior to binocular rivalry task. We found that when predictions can successfully influence the perception of the rivalrous stimuli, the power of beta band rhythms increases in primary visual cortices and beta band phase lag in a frontal-visual homologous channel pair was notably diminished. Building upon earlier works, our findings suggest that beta rhythm is potentially considered as a signature of top-down communication in the brain."

Current works mostly seek to compress the network by reducing its parameters or parameter-incurred computation, neglecting the influence of the input image on the system complexity. Based on the fact that input images of a CNN contain much redundant spatial content, we propose in this paper an efficient and unified framework, dubbed as ThumbNet, to simultaneously accelerate and compress CNN models by enabling them to infer on one thumbnail image. We provide three effective strategies to train ThumbNet. In doing so, ThumbNet learns an inference network that performs equally well on small images as the original-input network on large images. With ThumbNet, not only do we obtain the thumbnail-input inference network that can drastically reduce computation and memory requirements, but also we obtain an image downscaler that can generate thumbnail images for generic classification tasks. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of ThumbNet, and demonstrate that the thumbnail-input inference network learned by ThumbNet can adequately retain the accuracy of the original-input network even when the input images are downscaled 16 times."

In heavy rain, streaks are strongly visible, dense rain accumulation or rain veiling effect significantly washes out the image, further scenes are relatively more blurry, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these problems. We put forth a 2-stage network: a physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage. We have evaluated our method against the state of the art methods. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms them on real rain image data, recovering visually clean images with good details."

Such type of graphs are usually considered opposite to the regular graphs. An irregularity measure ($IM$) of a connected graph $G$ is a non-negative graph invariant satisfying the property: $IM(G) = 0$ if and only if $G$ is regular. The total irregularity of a graph $G$, denoted by $irr_t(G)$, is defined as $irr_t(G)= \sum_{\{u,v\} \subseteq V(G)} |d_u - d_v|$ where $V(G)$ is the vertex set of $G$ and $d_u$, $d_v$ denote the degrees of the vertices $u$, $v$, respectively. Antiregular graphs are the most nonregular graphs according to the irregularity measure $irr_t$; however, various non-antiregular graphs are also the most nonregular graphs with respect to this irregularity measure. In this note, two new irregularity measures having high discriminatory ability are devised. Only antiregular graphs are the most nonregular graphs according to the proposed measures."

We show that if the Hodge-de Rham short exact sequence of $X$ splits $G$-equivariantly then the action of $G$ on $X$ is weakly ramified. In particular, this generalizes the result of K\""{o}ck and Tait for hyperelliptic curves. We discuss also converse statements and tie this problem to lifting coverings of curves to the ring of Witt vectors of length $2$."

Differences between models are typically evaluated in the range appropriate for cosmic-ray air shower arrays ($10^{15}$-$10^{20}$ eV). However, accurate modelling of charged cosmic-ray measurements with ground based gamma-ray observatories is becoming more and more important. We assess the model predictions on the gross behaviour of measurable air shower parameters in the energy (0.1-100 TeV) and altitude ranges most appropriate for detection by ground-based gamma-ray observatories. We go on to investigate the particle distributions just after the first interaction point, to examine how differences in the micro-physics of the models may compound into differences in the gross air shower behaviour. Differences between the models above 1 TeV are typically less than 10%. However, we find the largest variation in particle densities at ground at the lowest energy tested (100 GeV), resulting from striking differences in the early stages of shower development."

This paper considers constraining GPs to arbitrarily-shaped domains with boundary conditions. We solve a Fourier-like generalised harmonic feature representation of the GP prior in the domain of interest, which both constrains the GP and attains a low-rank representation that is used for speeding up inference. The method scales as $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ in prediction and $\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ in hyperparameter learning for regression, where $n$ is the number of data points and $m$ the number of features. Furthermore, we make use of the variational approach to allow the method to deal with non-Gaussian likelihoods. The experiments cover both simulated and empirical data in which the boundary conditions allow for inclusion of additional physical information."

An example for this are embedded systems in autonomous cars that communicate in order to coordinate their actions.   Our model is a variant of the classical Page Migration Problem. More formally, we consider a mobile server holding a data page. The server can move in the Euclidean space (of arbitrary dimension). In every round, requests for data items from the page pop up at arbitrary points in the space. The requests are served, each at a cost of the distance from the requesting point and the server, and the mobile server may move, at a cost $D$ times the distance traveled for some constant $D$. We assume a maximum distance $m$ the server is allowed to move per round.   We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio independent of the length of the input sequence in this setting. Hence we augment the maximum movement distance of the online algorithms to $(1+\delta)$ times the maximum distance of the offline solution. We provide a deterministic algorithm which is simple to describe and works for multiple variants of our problem. The algorithm achieves almost tight competitive ratios independent of the length of the input sequence.   Our Algorithm also achieves a constant competitive ratio without resource augmentation in a variant where the distance between two consecutive requests is restricted to a constant smaller than the limit for the server."

We show these are holographically described by a deformation of the Schwarzian theory where the reparametrization mode is integrated over different coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. We show that the quantization of each coadjoint orbit is connected to 2d Liouville CFT between branes with insertions of Verlinde loop operators. We also propose an interpretation for the exceptional orbits. We use this perspective to solve these deformations of the Schwarzian theory, computing their partition function and correlators. In the process, we define two geometric observables: the horizon area operator $\Phi_h$ and the geodesic length operator $L(\gamma)$. We show this procedure is structurally related to the deformation of the particle-on-a-group quantum mechanics by the addition of a chemical potential. As an example, we solve the low-energy theory of complex SYK with a U(1) symmetry and generalize to the non-abelian case."
2961,11581,2019-04-10,2019-04-10,physics,3.0,2.0,1904.05231v1,Models of infiltration into homogeneous and fractal porous media with   localized sources,"We study a random walk infiltration (RWI) model, in homogeneous and in fractal media, with localized sources at their boundaries. The particles released at a source, which is maintained at a constant density, execute unbiased random walks over a lattice; it represents solute infiltration by diffusion into a medium in contact with a reservoir. A scaling approach shows that the infiltrated length, area, or volume evolves in time as the number of distinct sites visited by a single random walker in the same medium. This is consistent with simulations of the lattice model and exact and numerical solutions of the corresponding diffusion equation. In a Sierpinski carpet, the infiltrated area is expected to evolve as t^{D_F/D_W} (Alexander-Orbach relation), where D_F is the fractal dimension of the medium and D_W is the random walk dimension; the numerical integration of the diffusion equation supports this relation and improves results of lattice random walk simulations. In a Menger sponge in which D_F>D_W (a fractal with a dimension close to 3), a linear time increase of the infiltrated volume is predicted and confirmed numerically. Thus, no evidence of fractality can be observed in infiltrated volumes or masses in media where random walks are not recurrent, although the tracer diffusion is anomalous. We compare our results with a fluid infiltration model in which the pressure head is constant at the source and the front displacement is driven by the local gradient of that head. Exact or numerical solutions in two and three dimensions and in a carpet show that this type of fluid infiltration is in the same universality class of RWI, with an equivalence between the head and the particle concentration. These results set a relation between different infiltration processes with localized sources and the recurrence properties of random walks in the same media."

One of its main features is that voters can delegate their votes in a transitive manner such that: A delegates to B and B delegates to C leads to A indirectly delegates to C. These delegations can be effectively empowered by implementing liquid democracy in a social network, so that voters can delegate their votes to any of their neighbors in the network. However, it is uncertain that such a delegation process will lead to a stable state where all voters are satisfied with the people representing them. We study the stability (w.r.t. voters preferences) of the delegation process in liquid democracy and model it as a game in which the players are the voters and the strategies are their possible delegations. We answer several questions on the equilibria of this process in any social network or in social networks that correspond to restricted types of graphs.   We show that a Nash-equilibrium may not exist, and that it is even NP-complete to decide whether one exists or not. This holds even if the social network is a complete graph or a bounded degree graph. We further show that this existence problem is W[1]-hard w.r.t. the treewidth of the social network. Besides these hardness results, we demonstrate that an equilibrium always exists whatever the preferences of the voters iff the social network is a tree. We design a dynamic programming procedure to determine some desirable equilibria (e.g., minimizing the dissatisfaction of the voters) in polynomial time for tree social networks. Lastly, we study the convergence of delegation dynamics. Unfortunately, when an equilibrium exists, we show that a best response dynamics may not converge, even if the social network is a path or a complete graph."

Environmental sounds generally involve more sound sources while exhibiting less structure in temporal spectral representations. However, the background of an acoustic scene exhibits temporal homogeneity in acoustic properties, suggesting it could be characterized by distribution statistics rather than temporal details. In this work, we investigated using auditory summary statistics as the feature for ASC tasks. The inspiration comes from a recent neuroscience study, which shows the human auditory system tends to perceive sound textures through time-averaged statistics. Based on these statistics, we further proposed to use linear discriminant analysis to eliminate redundancies among these statistics while keeping the discriminative information, providing an extreme com-pact representation for acoustic scenes. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of the proposed feature over the conventional handcrafted features."

By tailoring optical gain and loss in integrated photonic structures, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric non-Hermitian photonics has found applications in many fields ranging from single mode lasing to novel topological matters. Here we propose a new paradigm towards non-Hermitian photonics based on the charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) symmetry that has the potential to control the flow of light in an unprecedented way. In particular, we consider continuous dielectric chiral materials, where the charge conjugation and parity symmetries are broken individually, but preserved jointly. Surprisingly, the phase transition between real and imaginary spectra across the exceptional point is accompanied by a dramatic change of the photonic band topology from dielectric to hyperbolic. We showcase broad applications of $\mathcal{CP}$ symmetric photonics such as all-angle polarization-dependent negative refraction materials, enhanced spontaneous emission for laser engineering, and non-Hermitian topological photonics. The $\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry opens an unexplored pathway for studying non-Hermitian photonics without optical gain/loss by connecting two previously distinct material properties: chirality and hyperbolicity, therefore providing a powerful tool for engineering many promising applications in photonics and other related fields."

Using a subset of hand-labeled articles from SemEval as a validation set, we test the performance of different parameters for BERT models. We find that accuracy from two different BERT models using different proportions of the articles is consistently high, with our best-performing model on the validation set achieving 85% accuracy and the best-performing model on the test set achieving 77%. We further determined that our model exhibits strong consistency, labeling independent slices of the same article identically. Finally, we find that randomizing the order of word pieces dramatically reduces validation accuracy (to approximately 60%), but that shuffling groups of four or more word pieces maintains an accuracy of about 80%, indicating the model mainly gains value from local context."

Through it, any spherical potential can be converted to an axisymmetric potential via the replacement of spherical polar $r^2$ with $R^2 + ( a + \!\sqrt{z^2+b^2} )^2$, where ($R,z$) are cylindrical coordinates and $a$ and $b$ are constants. We show that if the spherical potential has everywhere positive density, and satisfies some straightforward constraints, then the transformed model also corresponds to positive density everywhere. This is in sharp contradistinction to substitutions like $r^2 \rightarrow R^2 + z^2/q^2$, which leads to simple potentials but can give negative densities. We use the Miyamoto--Nagai substitution to generate a number of new flattened models with analytic potential--density pairs. These include (i) a flattened model with an asymptotically flat rotation curve, which (unlike Binney's logarithmic model) is always non-negative for a wide-range of axis ratios, (ii) flattened generalizations of the hypervirial models which include Satoh's disk as a limiting case and (iii) a flattened analogue of the Navarro--Frenk--White halo which has the cosmologically interesting density fall-off of (distance)$^{-3}$. Finally, we discuss properties of the prolate and triaxial generalizations of the Miyamoto-Nagai substitution."

In this study, we perform three dimensional computational investigation of a particle in a viscoelastic channel flow by considering combined inertial and elastic effects. We calculate equilibrium positions of the particle in the microchannel for a wide range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers, which are important in the design of microfluidic devices. The results provide an insight into the motion of cells and particles and explain the findings of previous experiments. Furthermore, we suggest new particle behaviors that have not been found before. Ultimately, a phase diagram is provided to predict the particle dynamics under a wide range of inertial and elastic effects."

In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of a flow-adapted version of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to a catalytic bacterial biofilm. A three-electrode microfluidic electrochemical flow cell measured increased turnover rates by as much as 50% from a Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm as flow rate was varied. Based on parameters from the applied kinetic framework, flow-induced increases to turnover rate, catalytic efficiency and device reaction capacity could be linked to an increase in catalytic biomass. This study demonstrates that a standardized kinetic framework is critical for quantitative measurements of new living catalytic systems in flow cells and for benchmarking against well-studied catalytic systems such as enzymes."

Every principal Galois order can be written as $eFe$ for any idempotent $e$ in an algebra $F$, which we call a flag Galois order; and in most important cases we can assume that these algebras are Morita equivalent. These algebras have the property that the completed algebra controlling the fiber over a maximal ideal has the same form as a subalgebra in a skew group ring, which gives a new perspective to a number of result about these algebras.   We also discuss how this approach relates to the study of Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima, which are particularly beautiful examples of principal Galois orders. These include most of the interesting examples of principal Galois orders, such as $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. In this case, all the objects discussed have a geometric interpretation which endows the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules with a graded lift and allows us to interpret the classes of simple Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in terms of dual canonical bases for the Grothendieck group. In particular, we classify Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and relate their characters to a generalization of Leclerc's shuffle expansion for dual canonical basis vectors.   Finally, as an application, we confirm a conjecture of Mazorchuk, showing that the weights of the Gelfand-Tsetlin integrable system which appear in finite-dimensional modules never appear in an infinite-dimensional simple module."

Carrier transport is modeled using the drift-Diffusion formulation, whereas light emission and propagation is modeled using Maxwell's equations. The drift Diffusion equation is solved self-consistently with Poisson equation. The carrier transport and photon emission are coupled by formulating an appropriate relation between radiative recombinations and dipole sources such that the strength of the dipole sources is given by the radiative recombination rates gauged to an appropriate value. This gauging factor is obtained by calibrating the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of homojunction GaN LED with the experimental value."

Such behavior has often been associated with the implosion conjecture and interpreted as the result of either momentum conservation while the eruption moves upward, or of the contraction of flare loops. We characterize the physical origin of these observed behaviors by analyzing a generic 3D MHD simulation of an eruptive flare. Even though the simulation was undesigned to recover the magnetic field and Lorentz force properties, it is fully consistent with them, and it provides key additional informations to understand them. The area where the magnetic field increases gradually develops between current ribbons, which spread away from each other and are connected to the coronal region. This area is merely the footprint of the coronal post-flare loops, whose contraction increases their shear field component and the magnetic energy density in line with the ideal induction equation. For simulated data, we computed the Lorentz force density map by applying the method used in observations. We obtained increase of the downward component of the Lorentz force density around the PIL -consistent with observations. However, this significantly differs from the Lorentz force density maps obtained directly from the 3D magnetic field and current. These results altogether question previous interpretations based on the implosion conjecture and momentum conservation with the CME, and rather imply that the observed increases in photospheric horizontal magnetic fields result from the reconnection-driven contraction of sheared flare-loops."

The price processes of crypto discount bonds are worked out, along with expressions for the instantaneous forward rates and the prices of interest-rate derivatives. The model admits functional degrees of freedom that can be calibrated to the initial yield curve and other market data.

The motion of spin textures affects the electronic states. Here we show that to describe correctly the electronic dynamics, the momentum space needs to be transcended to higher dimensions by including the ancillary dimensions associated with phason modes of the translational motion of the spin textures. The electronic states have non-trivial topology characterized by the first and second Chern numbers in the high dimensional hybrid momentum space. This gives rise to an anomalous electric charge transport due to the motion of spin textures. By deforming the spin textures, a nonlinear response associated with the second Chern number can be induced. The charge transport is derived from the semi-classical equation of motion of electrons that depends on the Berry curvature in the hybrid momentum space. Our results suggest that the motion of multiple-$Q$ spin textures has significant effects on the electronic dynamics and provides a new platform to explore high dimensional topological physics."

The study of the real-time behavior of various conductivities and susceptibilities help refine the simulation tools we use to compare the theories and the experimental findings. In this contribution we take steps to give the chiral magnetic conductivity in case of magnetic field and chiral imbalance are both space-time dependent. Using linear response approximation we present the general 1-loop resummed expression for the electric current. We also suggest simple limiting cases in hope for possible implementation into a hydrodynamical framework.

We call them \emph{volumetric benchmarks} (VBs) because they generalize IBM's benchmark for measuring quantum volume [1]. The quantum volume benchmark defines a family of \emph{square} circuits whose depth $d$ and width $w$ are the same. A volumetric benchmark defines a family of \emph{rectangular} quantum circuits, for which $d$ and $w$ are uncoupled to allow the study of time/space performance trade-offs. Each VB defines a mapping from circuit shapes -- $(w,d)$ pairs -- to test suites $\mathcal{C}(w,d)$. A test suite is an ensemble of test circuits that share a common structure. The test suite $\mathcal{C}$ for a given circuit shape may be a single circuit $C$, a specific list of circuits $\{C_1\ldots C_N\}$ that must all be run, or a large set of possible circuits equipped with a distribution $Pr(C)$. The circuits in a given VB share a structure, which is limited only by designers' creativity. We list some known benchmarks, and other circuit families, that fit into the VB framework: several families of random circuits, periodic circuits, and algorithm-inspired circuits. The last ingredient defining a benchmark is a success criterion that defines when a processor is judged to have ""passed"" a given test circuit. We discuss several options. Benchmark data can be analyzed in many ways to extract many properties, but we propose a simple, universal graphical summary of results that illustrates the Pareto frontier of the $d$ vs $w$ trade-off for the processor being benchmarked.

To meet the project specifications in efficiency and purity, the entire process chain of ionization, isotope separation, and implantation of $^{163}$Ho was optimized. A new two-step resonant laser ionization scheme was established at the $30\, kV$ magnetic mass separator RISIKO. This achieved ionization and separation efficiencies with an average of $69(5)_\textrm{stat}(4)_\textrm{sys}\,\%$ using intra-cavity frequency doubled Ti:sapphire lasers. The implantation of a $^{166\textrm{m}}$Ho impurity is suppressed about five orders of magnitude by the mass separation.

It is demonstrated that a set equipped with a $\mathsf{Q}$-valued dissimilarity is precisely a symmetric category enriched in a subquantaloid of the quantaloid of back diagonals of $\mathsf{Q}$. Interactions between $\mathsf{Q}$-valued dissimilarities and $\mathsf{Q}$-valued similarities (which are equivalent to $\mathsf{Q}$-valued equalities in the sense of H{\""o}hle--Kubiak) are investigated with the help of lax functors. In particular, it is shown that similarities and dissimilarities are interdefinable if $\mathsf{Q}$ is a Girard quantale with a hermitian and cyclic dualizing element."

The ASVspoof2019 is the extended version of the previous challenges and includes 2 evaluation conditions: logical access use-case scenario with speech synthesis and voice conversion attack types and physical access use-case scenario with replay attacks. During the challenge we developed anti-spoofing solutions for both scenarios. The proposed systems are implemented using deep learning approach and are based on different types of acoustic features. We enhanced Light CNN architecture previously considered by the authors for replay attacks detection and which performed high spoofing detection quality during the ASVspoof2017 challenge. In particular here we investigate the efficiency of angular margin based softmax activation for training robust deep Light CNN classifier to solve the mentioned-above tasks. Submitted systems achieved EER of 1.86% in logical access scenario and 0.54% in physical access scenario on the evaluation part of the Challenge corpora. High performance obtained for the unknown types of spoofing attacks demonstrates the stability of the offered approach in both evaluation conditions.

Particles are added to the system with a site-dependent creation rate, and removed from the system with a uniform annihilation rate. On a fully-connected lattice with a large number of sites, the mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for the number of particles at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping, creation and annihilation rates. This model of particles is mapped to a model of population dynamics: the site label is interpreted as a level of fitness, the site-dependent creation rate is interpreted as a selection function, and the hopping process is interpreted as the introduction of mutants. In the limit of large density, the fraction of the total population occupying each site approaches the limiting distribution in the house-of-cards model of selection-mutation, introduced by Kingman. A single site can be occupied by a macroscopic fraction of the particles if the mutation rate is below a critical value (which matches the critical value worked out in the house-of-cards model). This feature generalises to classes of selection functions that increase sufficiently fast at high fitness. The process can be mapped to a model of evolving networks, inspired by the Bianconi--Barab\'asi model, but involving a large and fixed set of nodes. Each node forms links at a rate biased by its fitness, moreover links are destroyed at a uniform rate, and redirected at a certain rate. If this redirection rate matches the mutation rate, the number of links pointing to nodes of a given fitness level is distributed as the numbers of particles in the non-conserving zero-range process. There is a finite critical redirection rate if the density of quenched fitnesses goes to zero sufficiently fast at high fitness."

Most methods based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) have small receptive fields, and hence they are unable to capture global context information of larger regions, with difficult to identify lesions. The final segmented retina vessels contain more noise with low classification accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DCNN structure named as D-Net. In the proposed D-Net, the dilation convolution is used in the backbone network to obtain a larger receptive field without losing spatial resolution, so as to reduce the loss of feature information and to reduce the difficulty of tiny thin vessels segmentation. The large receptive field can better distinguished between the lesion area and the blood vessel area. In the proposed Multi-Scale Information Fusion module (MSIF), parallel convolution layers with different dilation rates are used, so that the model can obtain more dense feature information and better capture retinal vessel information of different sizes. In the decoding module, the skip layer connection is used to propagate context information to higher resolution layers, so as to prevent low-level information from passing the entire network structure. Finally, our method was verified on DRIVE, STARE and CHASE dataset. The experimental results show that our network structure outperforms some state-of-art method, such as N4-fields, U-Net, and DRIU in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUCROC. Particularly, D-Net outperforms U-Net by 1.04%, 1.23% and 2.79% in DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE three dataset, respectively."

We provide an algorithm to determine the complete system of invariants for the osculating map of constant symbol $(\mathfrak g_-, \operatorname{gr} V, L)$, which in turn gives the complete system of invariants of a (weightedly) involutive system of linear differential equations of finite type and of constant symbol, by virtue of a categorical isomorphism between the extrinsic geometries in flag varieties and the involutive systems of linear differential equations of finite type. The invariants are proved to live in a cohomology group $H^1_+(\mathfrak g_-, \mathfrak l / \bar{\mathfrak g})$ which is defined algebraically from the symbol of the osculating map, and which, in many cases, can be computed by the algebraic harmonic theory, and the vanishing of which gives rigidity theorems in various concrete geometries. We also extend the theory to the case when $L$ is infinite dimensional and fulfills a unified method for the general equivalence problem of extrinsic geometry."

As is well known, the key point for such calculations is properly evaluating the hadronic transition matrix elements which are dominated by the non-perturbative QCD effect. In our calculation, we employ the light-front quark model and rather than the traditional diquark picture, we account the two spectator light quarks as individual ones. Namely during the transition, they retain their color indices, momenta and spin polarizations unchanged. Definitely, the subsystem composed of the two light quarks is still in a color-anti-triplet and possesses a definite spin, but we do not priori assume the two light quarks to be in a bound system-diquark. Our purpose is probing the diquark picture, via comparing the results with the available data, we test the validity and applicability of the diquark structure which turns a three-body problem into a two-body one, so greatly simplifies the calculation. It is indicated that the two approaches (diquark and a subsystem within which the two light quarks are free) lead to similar numerical results even though the model parameters in the two schemes might deviate slightly. Thus, the diquark approach seems sufficiently reasonable."

In this work, we study a one-dimensional phononic metamaterial, made of mechanical resonant oscillators and chiral couplings. We show that by design, the oscillator mass and inter-oscillator coupling, although both are positive naturally, can be either single negative or double negative effectively within a certain frequency range. At the frequency where the effective mass and coupling are both infinite, a flat band emerges that will induce an extremely high density of states. At the critical point of band degeneracy, a Dirac-like point emerges where both effective mass and the inverse of effective coupling are simultaneously zero, so that zero index is realized for phonons. Moreover, the phononic topological phase transition is observed that the phononic band gap switches between single mass-negative and single coupling-negative regime. As a consequence, a topological interface state is identified, well explained by the theory."

Being a theory of geometries, the phase transitions which in usual lattice field theories are used to define the continuum limit of the lattice theory will in the CDT case be transitions between different types of geometries. This picture is interwoven with the topology of space which is kept fixed in the lattice theory, the reason being that ""classical"" geometries around which the quantum fluctuations take place depend crucially on the imposed topology. Thus it is possible that the topology of space can influence the phase transitions and the corresponding critical phenomena used to extract continuum physics. In this article we perform a systematic comparison between a CDT phase transition where space has spherical topology and the ""same"" transition where space has toroidal topology. The ""classical"" geometries around which the systems fluctuate are very different it the two cases, but we find that the order of phase transition is not affected by this."

We show that the vortex lattice carries an electric current $I=\tfrac{1}{2}(Q_{\rm eff}^2/h)(\Phi/\Phi_0) V$ between two normal metal contacts at voltage difference $V$, with $\Phi$ the magnetic flux through the system, $\Phi_0$ the superconducting flux quantum, and $Q_{\rm eff}<e$ the renormalized charge of the Weyl fermions in the superconducting Landau level. Because the charge renormalization is energy dependent, a nonzero thermo-electric coefficient appears even in the absence of energy-dependent scattering processes."

The spectrum of the persistent emission was modeled with a blackbody component having a temperature between 1.31 and 1.67 keV and with a Comptonization component with an electron temperature of 9.4 keV and a photon index $\Gamma$ between 2.5 and 2.9. The presence of absorption features associated with highly ionized elements suggested the presence of partially ionized plasma in the system. Aims: In this work we performed a study of the spectrum of XB 1916-053, which aims to shed light on the nature of the seed photons that contribute to the Comptonization component. Methods: We analyzed three Suzaku observations of XB 1916-053: the first was performed in November 2006 and the others were carried out in October 2014. We extracted the persistent spectra from each observation and combined the spectra of the most recent observations, obtaining a single spectrum with a higher statistic. We also extracted and combined the spectra of the dips observed during the same observations. Results: On the basis of the available data statistics, we infer that the scenario in which the corona Comptonizes photons emitted both by the innermost region of the accretion disk and the NS surface is not statistically relevant with respect to the case in which only photons emitted by the NS surface are Comptonized. We find that the source is in a soft spectral state in all the analyzed observations. We detect the K$\alpha$ absorption lines of \ion{Fe}{xxv} and \ion{Fe}{xxvi}, which have already been reported in literature, and for the first time the K$\beta$ absorption lines of the same ions. We also detect an edge at 0.876 keV, which is consistent with a \ion{O}{viii} K absorption edge. (Abridged)"

The device consists of separate pixels for the emission of horizontally and vertically polarized THz radiation. The broadband (0.3-5.0THz) nature of the device is demonstrated, and the polarization angle of the generated far-field THz radiation is shown to be readily controlled by varying the relative bias voltage applied to the horizontally and vertically emitting pixels. The device is scalable in design, and with its simple method of polarization rotation it allows the modulation of the generated THz polarization at rates significantly faster than those achievable in ellipsometry systems based on mechanically rotating components."

The dynamics of light in such fibers is described by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with the Raman term, due to stimulated Raman self-scattering. It is shown that dispersive shock waves are formed during the evolution of sufficiently intensive pulses. In this case, the situation is much richer than for the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with Kerr nonlinearity only. The Whitham equations are obtained under the assumption that the Raman term can be considered as a small perturbation. These equations describe slow evolution of dispersive shock waves. It is shown that if one takes into account the Raman effect, then dispersive shock waves can asymptotically acquire a stationary profile. The analytical theory is confirmed by numerical calculations."

In recent work, we conjectured that if $G$ is nonamenable then the matrix of critical connection probabilities $T_{p_c}(u,v)=\mathbb{P}_{p_c}(u\leftrightarrow v)$ is bounded as an operator $T_{p_c}:L^2(V)\to L^2(V)$ and proved that this conjecture holds for several classes of graphs. We also noted in that work that the conjecture implies two older conjectures, namely that percolation on transitive nonamenable graphs always has a nontrivial nonuniqueness phase, and that critical percolation on the same class of graphs has mean-field critical behaviour.   In this paper we further investigate the consequences of the $L^2$ boundedness conjecture. In particular, we prove that the following hold for all transitive graphs: i) The two-point function decays exponentially in the distance for all $p<p_{2\to 2}$; ii) If $p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then the critical exponent governing the extrinsic diameter of a critical cluster is $1$; iii) Below $p_{2\to 2}$, percolation is ""ballistic"" in the sense that the intrinsic distance between two points is exponentially unlikely to be much larger than their extrinsic distance; iv) If $p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then $\|T_{p_c}\|_{q\to q} \asymp (q-1)^{-1}$ and $p_{q\to q}-p_c \asymp q-1$ as $q\downarrow 1$. v) If $p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then various 'multiple-arm' events have probabilities comparable to the upper bound given by the BK inequality. In particular, the probability that the origin is a trifurcation point is of order $(p-p_c)^3$ as $p \downarrow p_c$. All of these results are new even in the Gromov hyperbolic case.   Finally, we apply these results together with duality arguments to compute the critical exponents governing the geometry of intrinsic geodesics at the uniqueness threshold of percolation in the hyperbolic plane."

In this work, we derive the properties of optimal electromagnetic searches for these candidates, subject to the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) on amplification. We show that a single-pole resonant search may possess substantial sensitivity outside of the resonator bandwidth and that optimizing this sensitivity may increase scan rates by up to five orders of magnitude at low frequencies. Additional enhancements can be obtained with resonator quality factors exceeding one million, which corresponds to the linewidth of the dark matter signal. We present the resonator optimization in the broader context of determining the optimal receiver architecture (resonant or otherwise). We discuss prior probabilities on the dark matter signal and their role in the search optimization. We determine frequency-integrated sensitivity to be the figure of merit in a wideband search and demonstrate that it is limited by the Bode-Fano criterion. The optimized single-pole resonator is approximately 75% of the Bode-Fano limit, establishing it as a fundamentally near-ideal, single-moded dark matter detection scheme. Our analysis shows, in contrast to previous work, that the scanned single-pole resonant search is superior to a reactive broadband search. Our results motivate the broad application of quantum measurement techniques evading the SQL in future axion- and hidden-photon dark matter searches."

Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways.   Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents).   We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task."

To grapple with these problems and to define effective resource management solutions for their services, providers often must expend significant efforts and incur prohibitive costs in developing performance models of their services under a variety of interference scenarios on different hardware. This is a hard problem due to the wide range of possible co-located services and their workloads, and the growing heterogeneity in the runtime platforms including the use of fog and edge-based resources, not to mention the accidental complexity in performing application profiling under a variety of scenarios. To address these challenges, we present FECBench, a framework to guide providers in building performance interference prediction models for their services without incurring undue costs and efforts. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we developed a technique to build resource stressors that can stress multiple system resources all at once in a controlled manner to gain insights about the interference on an application's performance. Second, to overcome the need for exhaustive application profiling, FECBench intelligently uses the design of experiments (DoE) approach to enable users to build surrogate performance models of their services. Third, FECBench maintains an extensible knowledge base of application combinations that create resource stresses across the multi-dimensional resource design space. Empirical results using real-world scenarios to validate the efficacy of FECBench show that the predicted application performance has a median error of only 7.6% across all test cases, with 5.4% in the best case and 13.5% in the worst case."

The linear transformations, which are generally used in the fully-connected as well as convolutional layers, contain most of the variational parameters that are trained and stored. Compressing a deep neural network to reduce its number of variational parameters but not its prediction power is an important but challenging problem towards the establishment of an optimized scheme in training efficiently these parameters and in lowering the risk of overfitting. Here we show that this problem can be effectively solved by representing linear transformations with matrix product operators (MPO). We have tested this approach in five main neural networks, including FC2, LeNet-5, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet on two widely used datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10, and found that this MPO representation indeed sets up a faithful and efficient mapping between input and output signals, which can keep or even improve the prediction accuracy with dramatically reduced number of parameters."

For this purpose, we first write down the most general Lagrangian which can generate the desired effects and then calculate the generic expressions for all relevant $b\to s$ Wilson coefficients. Here we extend previous analysis by allowing that the new particles can also couple to right-handed Standard Model (SM) fermions as preferred by recent $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In the second part of this article we illustrate this generic approach for a UV complete model in which we supplement the Standard Model by a $4^{\rm th}$ generation of vector-like fermions and a real scalar field. This model allows one to coherently address the observed anomalies in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions and in $a_\mu$ without violating the bounds from other observables (in particular $B_s -\bar B_s$ mixing) or LHC searches. In fact, we find that our global fit to this model, after the recent experimental updates, is very good and prefers couplings to right-handed SM fermions, showing the importance of our generic setup and calculation performed in the first part of the article."

Load balancing method based on work of several components of network intrusion detection system and on the analysis of multifractal properties of incoming traffic is proposed. The proposed method takes into account a degree of multifractality for calculation of deep packet inspection time, on the basis of which the time necessary for comparing the packet with the signatures is calculated. Load balancing rules are generated using the estimated average deep packet inspection time and the multifractality parameters of incoming load. Comparative analysis of the proposed load balancing method with the standard one showed that the proposed method improves the quality of service parameters and the percentage of packets that are not analyzed."

Using the X-ray data, we measure energy-dependent morphologies and spatially-resolved spectra of the PWN. We find that the PWN size becomes smaller with increasing energy and that the spectrum is softer in outer regions. In the spatially integrated spectrum of the PWN, we find a hint of a spectral break at $\sim$25 keV. We interpret these findings using synchrotron-radiation scenarios. We attribute the size change to the synchrotron burn-off effect. The radial profile of the spectral index has a break at $R\sim80''$, implying a maximum electron energy of $\sim$200 TeV which is larger than a previous estimate, and the 25-keV spectral break corresponds to a maximum electron energy of $\sim$140 TeV for an assumed magnetic field strength of 80 $\mu$G. Combining the X-ray data and a previous radio-to-IR SED, we measure a cooling break frequency to be $\sim 10^{15}$ Hz, which constrains the magnetic-field strength in 3C 58 to be 30-200$\mu$G for an assumed age range of 800-5000 years."

Among them the planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG) algorithm uses $3n-6$ edges to build a graph whose features include a high frequency of small cliques and a good clustering of stocks. We propose a new algorithm which we call proportional degree (PD) to filter information on the complete graph of normalised mutual information (NMI) across stocks. Our results show that the PD algorithm produces a network showing better homogeneity with respect to cliques, as compared to economic sectoral classification than its PMFG counterpart. We also show that the partition of the PD network obtained through normalised spectral clustering (NSC) agrees better with the NSC of the complete graph than the corresponding one obtained from PMFG. Finally, we show that the clusters in the PD network are more robust with respect to the removal of random sets of edges than those in the PMFG network."

Their radial limits at the roots of unity should recover the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. In this paper we discuss how, for complements of knots in $S^3$, the analogue of the invariants $\hat{Z}_{a}(q)$ should be a two-variable series $F_K(x,q)$ obtained by parametric resurgence from the asymptotic expansion of the colored Jones polynomial. The terms in this series should satisfy a recurrence given by the quantum A-polynomial. Furthermore, there is a formula that relates $F_K(x,q)$ to the invariants $\hat{Z}_{a}(q)$ for Dehn surgeries on the knot. We provide explicit calculations of $F_K(x,q)$ in the case of knots given by negative definite plumbings with an unframed vertex, such as torus knots. We also find numerically the first terms in the series for the figure-eight knot, up to any desired order, and use this to understand $\hat{Z}_a(q)$ for some hyperbolic 3-manifolds."

Instead of training deep models for this purpose in a blind manner, we propose to inspect factors that contribute to gaze guidance during daily tasks. Bottom-up saliency and optical flow are assessed versus strong spatial prior baselines. Task-specific cues such as vanishing point, manipulation point, and hand regions are analyzed as representatives of top-down information. We also look into the contribution of these factors by investigating a simple recurrent neural model for ego-centric gaze prediction. First, deep features are extracted for all input video frames. Then, a gated recurrent unit is employed to integrate information over time and to predict the next fixation. We also propose an integrated model that combines the recurrent model with several top-down and bottom-up cues. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets reveal that (1) spatial biases are strong in egocentric videos, (2) bottom-up saliency models perform poorly in predicting gaze and underperform spatial biases, (3) deep features perform better compared to traditional features, (4) as opposed to hand regions, the manipulation point is a strong influential cue for gaze prediction, (5) combining the proposed recurrent model with bottom-up cues, vanishing points and, in particular, manipulation point results in the best gaze prediction accuracy over egocentric videos, (6) the knowledge transfer works best for cases where the tasks or sequences are similar, and (7) task and activity recognition can benefit from gaze prediction. Our findings suggest that (1) there should be more emphasis on hand-object interaction and (2) the egocentric vision community should consider larger datasets including diverse stimuli and more subjects."

Due to its particle-antiparticle equivalence, an MZM exhibits robust resonant Andreev reflection and 2e2/h quantized conductance at low temperature. By utilizing variable-tunnel-coupled scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study tunneling conductance of vortex bound states on FeTe0.55Se0.45 superconductors. We report observations of conductance plateaus as a function of tunnel coupling for zero-energy vortex bound states with values close to or even reaching the 2e2/h quantum conductance. In contrast, no such plateau behaviors were observed on either finite energy Caroli-de Genne-Matricon bound states or in the continuum of electronic states outside the superconducting gap. This unique behavior of the zero-mode conductance reaching a plateau strongly supports the existence of MZMs in this iron-based superconductor, which serves as a promising single-material platform for Majorana braiding at a relatively high temperature."

In order to have a complete understanding of their behavior, in parallel with on beam testing, a Monte Carlo code has to be developed to simulate their response to the passage of particles. The software must take into account all the physical processes involved from the primary ionization up to the signal formation, e.g. the avalanche multiplication and the effect of the diffusion on the electrons. In the case of gas detectors, existing software such as Garfield already perform a very detailed simulation but are CPU time consuming. A description of a reliable but faster simulation is presented here: it uses a parametric description of the variables of interest obtained by suitable preliminary Garfield simulations and tuned to the test beam data. It can reproduce the real values of the charge measured by the strip, needed to reconstruct the position with the Charge Centroid method. In addition, particular attention was put to the simulation of the timing information, which permits to apply also the micro-Time Projection Chamber position reconstruction, for the first time on a triple-GEM. A comparison between simulation and experimental values of some sentinel variables in different conditions of magnetic field, high voltage settings and incident angle will be shown."

Entropy and dynamics,"Macroscopic fields like electromagnetic, MHD, acoustic or gravitational waves are usually described by classical wave equations with possible additional damping terms and coherent sources. The aim of this paper is to develop a complete macroscopic formalism including random/thermal sources, dissipation and random scattering of waves by environment. The proposed reduced state of field (RSF) combines averaged field with the two-point correlation function called single-particle density matrix. The evolution equations for RSF is obtained by reduction of the generalized quasi-free dynamical semigroups describing irreversible evolution of bosonic quantum field and the definition of RSF's entropy follows from the von Neumann entropy of quantum field states. The presented formalism can be applied, for example, to superradiance phenomena and allows to unify the Mueller and Jones calculi in polarization optics."

Reject inference is the process of attempting to infer the creditworthiness status of the rejected applications. In this research, we use deep generative models to develop two new semi-supervised Bayesian models for reject inference in credit scoring, in which we model the data generating process to be dependent on a Gaussian mixture. The goal is to improve the classification accuracy in credit scoring models by adding reject applications. Our proposed models infer the unknown creditworthiness of the rejected applications by exact enumeration of the two possible outcomes of the loan (default or non-default). The efficient stochastic gradient optimization technique used in deep generative models makes our models suitable for large data sets. Finally, the experiments in this research show that our proposed models perform better than classical and alternative machine learning models for reject inference in credit scoring."

Solar outflows are a considerable source of free energy which accumulates in multiple forms like beaming (or drifting) components and/or temperature anisotropies. However, kinetic anisotropies of plasma particles do not grow indefinitely and particle-particle collisions are not efficient enough to explain the observed limits of these anisotropies. Instead, the self-generated wave instabilities can efficiently act to constrain kinetic anisotropies, but the existing approaches are simplified and do not provide satisfactory explanations. Thus, small deviations from isotropy shown by the electron temperature ($T$) in fast solar winds are not explained yet.   Aims. This paper provides an advanced quasilinear description of the whistler instability driven by the anisotropic electrons in conditions typical for the fast solar winds. The enhanced whistler-like fluctuations may constrain the upper limits of temperature anisotropy $A \equiv T_\perp /T_\parallel > 1$, where $\perp, \parallel$ are defined with respect to the magnetic field direction.   Methods. Studied are the self-generated whistler instabilities, cumulatively driven by the temperature anisotropy and the relative (counter)drift of the electron populations, e.g., core and halo electrons. Recent studies have shown that quasi-stable states are not bounded by the linear instability thresholds but an extended quasilinear approach is necessary to describe them in this case.   Results. Marginal conditions of stability are obtained from a quasilinear theory of the cumulative whistler instability, and approach the quasi-stable states of electron populations reported by the observations.The instability saturation is determined by the relaxation of both the temperature anisotropy and the relative drift of electron populations."

Here, we propose a novel topological phase that exhibits features of both and is dubbed composite Dirac semimetal (CDSM). In its bulk, the CDSM has a pair of Dirac points and a pair of bands inverted along a high-symmetry path. At side surfaces, a pair of Fermi arcs connecting the projected Dirac points coexist with a pair of Fermi loops traversing the surface Brillouin zone. A nonsymmorphic symmetry dictates degeneracies between the Fermi arcs and the Fermi loops. We characterize the CDSM by multiple topological invariants and show that, under a transition without breaking any symmetry, it deforms into a topological crystalline insulator hosting two pairs of surface Fermi loops. We demonstrate the CDSM in two models and predict its realization in the KAuTe-family materials."

It relies on the observation that the dynamical structure factor of the interacting electron gas shows a logarithmic threshold singularity when evaluated to first order perturbation theory in the two-particle interaction. This term was interpreted as the linear one in an expansion which was conjectured to resum to a power law. A field theory, the mobile impurity model, which is constructed such that it provides the power law in the structure factor, was suggested to be the proper effective model and used to compute the single-particle spectral function. This forms the basis of the nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology. Surprisingly, the second order perturbative contribution to the structure factor was so far not studied. We first close this gap and show that it is consistent with the conjectured power law. Secondly, we critically assess the steps leading to the mobile impurity Hamiltonian. We show that the model does not allow to include the effect of the momentum dependence of the (bulk) two-particle potential. This dependence was recently shown to spoil power laws in the single-particle spectral function which previously were believed to be part of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid universality. Although our second order results for the structure factor are consistent with power-law scaling, this raises doubts that the conjectured nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology can be considered as universal. We conclude that more work is required to clarify this."

SUs can adaptively switch between FD transmission-and-reception (TR) and transmission-and-sensing (TS) modes based on the NN prediction results for each transmission duration. The prediction performance is then analysed in terms of prediction error probability. We also compare the performance of our proposed scheme with conventional TR and TS modes in terms of SUs average throughput and collision probability, respectively. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves even better SUs average throughput compared with TR mode. Meanwhile, the collision probability can be reduced close to the level of TS mode."

Specifically, we find the minimal energy increase $\Delta E_{\mathrm{min}}$ in the system resulting from replacing an entangled pair of modes, sharing entanglement entropy $\Delta S$, by a product state, and we show how to construct modes achieving this minimal energy cost. Thus, we obtain a protocol independent lower bound on the extraction of pure state entanglement from quadratic systems. Due to their generality, our results apply to a large range of physical systems, as we discuss with examples."

The proposed deep network has four convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers, and two parallel fully connected layers. To adjust the deep network to multi-task learning problem, we propose to learn a low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer, and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty, so that the useful features learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark data sets of multiple face attribute prediction, multi-task natural language processing, and joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of the low-rank deep CNN model over multi-task problems."

While Bayesian models offer a computationally tractable way of recovering uncertainty, they need large data volumes to be trained, which in imaging applications implicates prohibitively expensive collections with specific imaging instruments. This paper introduces a novel framework to train variational inference for inverse problems exploiting in combination few experimentally collected data, domain expertise and existing image data sets. In such a way, Bayesian machine learning models can solve imaging inverse problems with minimal data collection efforts. Extensive simulated experiments show the advantages of the proposed framework. The approach is then applied to two real experimental optics settings: holographic image reconstruction and imaging through highly scattering media. In both settings, state of the art reconstructions are achieved with little collection of training data."

In this paper, we provide a contemporary survey of AL, focused particularly on defenses against attacks on statistical classifiers. After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis; we identify the hyperparameters a particular method requires, its computational complexity, as well as the performance measures on which it was evaluated and the obtained quality. We then dig deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: 1) robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; 2) the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; 3) small perturbations for test-time evasion attacks: a fallacy or a requirement?; 4) validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; 5) black, grey, or white box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; 6) susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

However the resulting models are specialized to a single very specific task and domain. Adapting the learned classification to new domains is a hard problem due to at least three reasons: (1) the new domains and the tasks might be drastically different; (2) there might be very limited amount of annotated data on the new domain and (3) full training of a new model for each new task is prohibitive in terms of computation and memory, due to the sheer number of parameters of deep CNNs. In this paper, we present a method to learn new-domains and tasks incrementally, building on prior knowledge from already learned tasks and without catastrophic forgetting. We do so by jointly parametrizing weights across layers using low-rank Tucker structure. The core is task agnostic while a set of task specific factors are learnt on each new domain. We show that leveraging tensor structure enables better performance than simply using matrix operations. Joint tensor modelling also naturally leverages correlations across different layers. Compared with previous methods which have focused on adapting each layer separately, our approach results in more compact representations for each new task/domain. We apply the proposed method to the 10 datasets of the Visual Decathlon Challenge and show that our method offers on average about 7.5x reduction in number of parameters and competitive performance in terms of both classification accuracy and Decathlon score."

We identify a sample of $92$ UDGs in the simulations that match a wide range of observables such as sizes, central surface brightness, S\'{e}rsic indices, colors, spatial distribution and abundance. Auriga UDGs have dynamical masses similar to normal dwarfs. In the field, the key to their origin is a strong correlation present in low-mass dark matter haloes between galaxy size and halo spin parameter. Field UDGs form in dark matter haloes with larger spins compared to normal dwarfs in the field, in agreement with previous semi-analytical models. Satellite UDGs, on the other hand, have two different origins: $\sim 55\%$ of them formed as field UDGs before they were accreted; the remaining $\sim 45\%$ were normal field dwarfs that subsequently turned into UDGs as a result of tidal interactions."

In this work, we examine the X-ray morphologies of different elements from oxygen to iron found in the youngest known core-collapse (CC) SNR in the Milky Way, Cassiopeia A. The heaviest elements exhibit the highest levels of asymmetry, which we relate to the burning process that created the elements and their proximity to the center of explosion. Our findings support recent model predictions that the material closest to the source of explosion will reflect the asymmetries inherent to the SN mechanism. Additionally, we find that the heaviest elements are moving more directly opposed to the neutron star (NS) than the lighter elements. This result is consistent with NS kicks arising from ejecta asymmetries."

To support arbitrary routing protocols in WASNs, the routing-dependent necessary conditions for the optimal deployment are explored. Based on these necessary conditions, we propose a routing-aware Lloyd algorithm to optimize node deployment.

Generalized linear models are commonly used to analyze categorical data. The model-based mean for a treatment group usually estimates the response at the mean covariate. However, the mean response for the treatment group for studied population is at least equally important in the context of clinical trials. New methods were proposed to estimate such a mean response in generalized linear models; however, this has only been done when there are no random effects in the model. We suggest that, in a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), there are at least two possible definitions of a treatment group mean response that can serve as estimation/prediction targets. The estimation of these treatment group means is important for healthcare professionals to be able to understand the absolute benefit versus risk. For both of these treatment group means, we propose a new set of methods that suggests how to estimate/predict both of them in a GLMM models with a univariate subject-wise random effect. Our methods also suggest an easy way of constructing corresponding confidence and prediction intervals for both possible treatment group means.

One way to address this question is to find an upper bound on the probability (equivalently a lower bound on the negative log likelihood) that the model can assign to some data as one varies the prior and/or the likelihood function in a latent variable model. The core of our contribution is to formally show that the problem of optimizing priors in latent variable models is exactly an instance of the variational optimization problem that information theorists solve when computing rate-distortion functions, and then to use this to derive a lower bound on negative log likelihood. Moreover, we will show that if changing the prior can improve the log likelihood, then there is a way to change the likelihood function instead and attain the same log likelihood, and thus rate-distortion theory is of relevance to both optimizing priors as well as optimizing likelihood functions. We will experimentally argue for the usefulness of quantities derived from rate-distortion theory in latent variable modeling by applying them to a problem in image modeling."

This notion of spatial redundancy must be defined locally and thus we give some examples of functions (auto-similarity and template similarity) which, given one or two images, computes a similarity measurement between patches. Two patches are said to be similar if the similarity measurement is small enough. To derive a criterion for taking a decision on the similarity between two patches we present an a contrario model. Namely, two patches are said to be similar if the associated similarity measurement is unlikely to happen in a background model. Choosing Gaussian random fields as background models we derive non-asymptotic expressions for the probability distribution function of similarity measurements. We introduce a fast algorithm in order to assess redundancy in natural images and present applications in denoising, periodicity analysis and texture ranking."

Such temporal networks (or edge streams) consist of a sequence of timestamped edges and are seemingly ubiquitous. Despite the importance of accurately modeling the temporal information, most embedding methods ignore it entirely or approximate the temporal network using a sequence of static snapshot graphs. In this work, we introduce the notion of \emph{temporal walks} for learning dynamic embeddings from temporal networks. Temporal walks capture the temporally valid interactions (\eg, flow of information, spread of disease) in the dynamic network in a lossless fashion. Based on the notion of temporal walks, we describe a general class of embeddings called continuous-time dynamic network embeddings (CTDNEs) that completely avoid the issues and problems that arise when approximating the temporal network as a sequence of static snapshot graphs. Unlike previous work, CTDNEs learn dynamic node embeddings directly from the temporal network at the finest temporal granularity and thus use only temporally valid information. As such CTDNEs naturally support online learning of the node embeddings in a streaming real-time fashion. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this class of embedding methods for prediction in temporal networks."

The sheet resistance, transparency, and haze were measured for each sample. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we studied the electrical conductivity of random resistor networks produced by the random deposition of the conducting rings onto the substrate. Both systems of equal-sized rings, and systems with rings of different sizes were simulated. Our simulations demonstrated the linear dependence of the electrical conductivity on the number of rings per unit area. Size dispersity decreased the percolation threshold, but without having any other significant effect on the behavior of the electrical conductance. Analytical estimations obtained for dense systems of equal-sized conductive rings were consistent with the simulations."

By selecting the appropriate coefficients, the space-time solutions can possess a unique AdS vacuum with a fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda=-\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2\ell^{2}}$. The black hole solutions can be divided into two cases: $d>2k+1$ and $d=2k+1$. In the case of $d>2k+1$, the black hole is in an analogy with the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, and the life time is bounded by a time of the order of $\ell^{d-2k+1}$, which reduces Page's result on the Einstein gravity in $k=1$. In the case of $d=2k+1$, the black hole resembles the three dimensional black hole. The black hole vacuum corresponds to $T=0$, so the black hole will take infinite time to evaporate away for any initial states, which obeys the third law of thermodynamics. In the asymptotically flat limit $\ell\rightarrow \infty$, the system reduces to the pure Lovelock gravity that only possesses the highest $k$-th order term. For a initial mass $M_0$, the life time of the black hole is in the order of $M_0^{\frac{d-2k+1}{d-2k-1}}$."

J. \v{C}erny discovered in 1964 a sequence of $n$-state complete DFA possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length $(n-1)^2$. The hypothesis, well known today as \v{C}erny conjecture, claims that $(n-1)^2$ is a precise upper bound on the length of such a word over alphabet $\Sigma$ of letters on edges of $\Gamma$ for every complete $n$-state DFA. The hypothesis was formulated distinctly in 1966 by Starke. A special classes of matrices induced by words in the alphabet of labels on edges of the underlying graph of DFA are used for the study of synchronizing automata."

With the help of deep learning, activity understanding has made huge progress recently. But some challenges such as imbalanced data distribution, action ambiguity, complex visual patterns still remain. To address these and promote the activity understanding, we build a large-scale Human Activity Knowledge Engine (HAKE) based on the human body part states. Upon existing activity datasets, we annotate the part states of all the active persons in all images, thus establish the relationship between instance activity and body part states. Furthermore, we propose a HAKE based part state recognition model with a knowledge extractor named Activity2Vec and a corresponding part state based reasoning network. With HAKE, our method can alleviate the learning difficulty brought by the long-tail data distribution, and bring in interpretability. Now our HAKE has more than 7 M+ part state annotations and is still under construction. We first validate our approach on a part of HAKE in this preliminary paper, where we show 7.2 mAP performance improvement on Human-Object Interaction recognition, and 12.38 mAP improvement on the one-shot subsets."

Spontaneous scalarization of BHs is a phenomenon that the scalar field spontaneously obtains a nontrivial profile in the vicinity of the event horizon via the nonminimal couplings and eventually the BH possesses a scalar charge. In the theory in which spontaneous scalarization takes place, the Schwarzschild solution with a trivial profile of the scalar field exhibits a tachyonic instability in the vicinity of the event horizon, and evolves into a hairy BH solution. Our analysis will extend the previous studies about the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theory to other classes of the Horndeski theory. First, we clarify the conditions for the existence of the vanishing scalar field solution $\phi=0$ on top of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and we apply them to each individual generalized galileon coupling. For each coupling, we choose the coupling function with minimal power of $\phi$ and $X:=-(1/2)g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$ that satisfies the above condition, which leaves nonzero and finite imprints in the radial perturbation of the scalar field. Second, we investigate the radial perturbation of the scalar field about the $\phi=0$ solution on top of the Schwarzschild spacetime. While each individual generalized galileon coupling except for a generalized quartic coupling does not satisfy the hyperbolicity condition or realize a tachyonic instability of the Schwarzschild spacetime by itself, a generalized quartic coupling can realize it in the intermediate length scales outside the event horizon. Finally, we investigate a model with generalized quartic and quintic galileon couplings, which includes the Einstein-scalar-GB theory as the special case."

This work focuses on coupled chemo-mechanical modeling of bonded geomaterials undergoing either mechanical strengthening, due to increased cementation, or weakening, due to cement dissolution. A constitutive model is developed that accounts for the multi-scale nature of the chemo-mechanical problem, introducing some cross-scale functions establishing a relationship between the evolution of microscopic variables and the macroscopic material behavior, realistically following the evolution of the reactive surface area, cross-sectional area and the number of bonds along with dissolution/deposition. The model presented here builds up on a previously introduced framework. However, at variance with existing works, it is specialized on materials with only reactive bonds, such as carbonate cemented sandstone or microbially cemented silica sand. Model validation is provided upon reproducing different types of chemo-mechanical experimental datasets, on different naturally and artificially cemented materials, to establish the reliability of the proposed framework."

CCDM suffers from significant rate loss at short blocklengths and requires long blocklengths to achieve high shaping gain, which makes its implementation very challenging. In this paper, we propose to use enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) and investigate its performance for the nonlinear fiber optical channel. ESS has lower rate loss than CCDM at the same shaping rate, which makes it a suitable candidate to be implemented in real-time high-speed optical systems. In this paper, we first show that finite blocklength ESS and CCDM exhibit higher effective signal-to-noise ratio than their infinite blocklength counterparts. These results show that for the nonlinear fiber optical channel, large blocklengths should be avoided. We then show that for a 400 Gb/s dual-polarization 64-QAM WDM transmission system, ESS with short blocklengths outperforms both uniform signaling and CCDM. Gains in terms of both bit-metric decoding rate and bit-error rate are presented. ESS with a blocklength of 200 is shown to provide an extension reach of about 200 km in comparison with CCDM with the same blocklength. The obtained reach increase of ESS with a blocklength of 200 over uniform signaling is approximately 450 km (approximately 19%)"

The notion of Quantum Chesire Cat challenges this, as far as quantum systems are concerned. It shows that a quantum system can be decoupled from its physical property under suitable pre and postselections. However, in the Quantum Cheisre Cat setup, the decoupling is not permanent. The photon, for example, and its polarization is separated and then recombined. In this paper, we present a thought experiment where we decouple two photons from their respective polarizations and then interchange them during recombination. Thus, our proposal shows that that the belongingness of a property for a physical system is very volatile in the world of quantum mechanics."

The $\alpha$ + core interaction is described by a nuclear potential of (1 + Gaussian)$\times$(W.S. + W.S.$^3$) shape with two free parameters, which has been successfully tested in nuclei of different mass regions. The model produces $Q_{\alpha}$ values and $\alpha$-decay half-lives for $^{104}$Te in agreement with the 2018 experimental data of Auranen et al. in the energy range $5.13 \; \mathrm{MeV} < Q_{\alpha} < 5.3 \; \mathrm{MeV}$ using an $\alpha$ preformation factor $P_{\alpha} = 1$. The comparison of the calculated reduced $\alpha$-widths for the ground state bands of $^{104}$Te, $^{94}$Mo and $^{212}$Po indicates that $^{104}$Te has an $\alpha$-cluster degree significantly higher than $^{94}$Mo and much higher than $^{212}$Po. These results point to $^{104}$Te as a preferential nucleus for $\alpha$-clustering in the $N,Z = 50$ region and corroborate the statement on the superallowed $\alpha$-decay in $^{104}$Te."

Thus, automatic facial expression recognition is an interesting and crucial task to interpret the humans cognitive state through the machine. In this paper, we proposed an Exigent Features Preservative Network (EXPERTNet), to describe the features of the facial expressions. The EXPERTNet extracts only pertinent features and neglect others by using exigent feature (ExFeat) block, mainly comprises of elective layer. Specifically, elective layer selects the desired edge variation features from the previous layer outcomes, which are generated by applying different sized filters as 1 x 1, 3 x 3, 5 x 5 and 7 x 7. Different sized filters aid to elicits both micro and high-level features that enhance the learnability of neurons. ExFeat block preserves the spatial structural information of the facial expression, which allows to discriminate between different classes of facial expressions. Visual representation of the proposed method over different facial expressions shows the learning capability of the neurons of different layers. Experimental and comparative analysis results over four comprehensive datasets CK+, MMI DISFA and GEMEP-FERA, ensures the better performance of the proposed network as compared to existing networks."

More than half (55%) of the hosts contain regular disks, and a substantial fraction (38%), in fact, are disk-dominated ($B/T\lesssim 0.2$) late-type galaxies with low Sersic indices ($n < 2$), which is characteristic of pseudo bulges.

The half-space geometry supports an edge and a bulk surface plasmon (SP) mode. The Purcell factor of the QE is enhanced over eight orders of magnitude when its emission energy matches the resonance energy modes, for a specific value of the in-plane wave vector, at a separation distance of $5\,$nm. The different transition dipole moment orientations influence differently the enhancement factor of a QE, leading to large anisotropic behavior when positioned at different places above the half-space geometry. The field distribution is presented, showing clearly the excitation of the SP modes at the edge of the nanostructures. Also, we present the spontaneous emission spectrum of the QE near the half-space graphene nanostructure and show that strong light-matter coupling may emerge. When a QE with a free-space lifetime of $1\,$ns is placed at a distance of $10\,$nm away from the edge of the graphene half-space, a Rabi splitting of $80 \,m$eV is found.

In the standard formal framework, PDBs are finite probability spaces over relational database instances. It has been argued convincingly that this is not compatible with an open world semantics (Ceylan et al., KR 2016) and with application scenarios that are modeled by continuous probability distributions (Dalvi et al., CACM 2009).   We recently introduced a model of PDBs as infinite probability spaces that addresses these issues (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019). While that work was mainly concerned with countably infinite probability spaces, our focus here is on uncountable spaces. Such an extension is necessary to model typical continuous probability distributions that appear in many applications. However, an extension beyond countable probability spaces raises nontrivial foundational issues concerned with the measurability of events and queries and ultimately with the question whether queries have a well-defined semantics.   It turns out that so-called finite point processes are the appropriate model from probability theory for dealing with probabilistic databases. This model allows us to construct suitable (uncountable) probability spaces of database instances in a systematic way. Our main technical results are measurability statements for relational algebra queries as well as aggregate queries and datalog queries."

Multiple examples of frisson-inducing sounds have been reported, but the mechanism of auditory frisson remains elusive. Typical frisson-inducing sounds may contain a looming effect, in which a sound appears to approach the listener's peripersonal space. Previous studies on sound in peripersonal space have provided objective measurements of sound-inducing effects, but few have investigated the subjective experience of frisson-inducing sounds. Here we explored whether it is possible to produce subjective feelings of frisson by moving a noise sound (white noise, rolling beads noise, or frictional noise produced by rubbing a plastic bag) stimulus around a listener's head. Our results demonstrated that sound-induced frisson can be experienced stronger when auditory stimuli are rotated around the head (binaural moving sounds) than the one without the rotation (monaural static sounds), regardless of the source of the noise sound. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that several acoustic features of auditory stimuli, such as variance of interaural level difference (ILD), loudness, and sharpness, were correlated with the magnitude of subjective frisson. We had also observed that the subjective feelings of frisson by moving a musical sound had increased comparing with a static musical sound."

In this new context, it is important to know not only which brain areas are activated by a particular stimulus but, mainly, how these areas are structurally and functionally connected, distributed, and organized in relation to other areas. Additionally, the arrangement of the network elements, i.e., its topology, and the dynamics they give rise to are also important. This new approach is called connectomics. It brings together a series of techniques and methodologies capable of systematizing, from the different types of signals and images of the nervous system, how neuronal units to brain areas are connected. Through this approach, the different patterns of connectivity can be graphically and mathematically represented by the so-called connectomes. The connectome uses quantitative metrics to evaluate structural and functional information from images of neural tracts and pathways or signals from the metabolic and/or electrophysiologic activity of cell populations or brain areas. Besides, with adequate treatment of this information, it is also possible to infer causal relationships. In this way, structural and functional evaluations are complementary descriptions which, together, represent the anatomic and physiologic neural properties, establishing a new paradigm for understanding how the brain functions by looking at brain connections. Here, we highlight five critical elements of a network that allows an integrative analysis, focusing mainly on a functional description. These elements include; (i) the properties of its nodes; (ii) the metrics for connectivity and coupling between nodes; (iii) the network topologies; (iv) the network dynamics and (v) the interconnections between different domains and scales of network representations."

Our goal is to verify if this numerically efficient method provides sufficiently accurate phonon frequencies and group velocities to compute reliable thermoelectric properties. To this end, the results are compared to available DFT results and experimental data. To quantify the accuracy for a given band, a descriptor is introduced that summarizes contributions to the lattice conductivity that are available already in the harmonic approximation. We find that the DFTB predictions depend strongly on the employed repulsive pair-potentials, which are an important prerequisite of this method. For carbon-based materials, accurate pair-potentials are identified and lead to errors of the descriptor that are of the same order as differences between different local and semi-local DFT approaches."

They were independently introduced in modal logic to capture the intersection of Horn first-order logic with modal logic. In this paper, we introduce model comparison games for the basic Horn description logic hornALC (corresponding to the basic Horn modal logic) and use them to obtain an Ehrenfeucht-Fra\""iss\'e type definability result and a van Benthem style expressive completeness result for hornALC. We also establish a finite model theory version of the latter. The Ehrenfeucht-Fra\""iss\'e type definability result is used to show that checking hornALC indistinguishability of models is ExpTime-complete, which is in sharp contrast to ALC indistinguishability (i.e., bisimulation equivalence) checkable in PTime. In addition, we explore the behavior of Horn fragments of more expressive description and modal logics by defining a Horn guarded fragment of first-order logic and introducing model comparison games for it."

One of the most prominent applications of blockchains is cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. In this work, we consider a particular attack on wallets for collecting assets in a cryptocurrency network based on brute-force search attacks. Using Bitcoin as an example, we demonstrate that if the attack is implemented successfully, a legitimate user is able to prove that fact of this attack with a high probability. We also consider two options for modification of existing cryptocurrency protocols for dealing with this type of attacks. First, we discuss a modification that requires introducing changes in the Bitcoin protocol and allows diminishing the motivation to attack wallets. Second, an alternative option is the construction of special smart-contracts, which reward the users for providing evidence of the brute-force attack. The execution of this smart-contract can work as an automatic alarm that the employed cryptographic mechanisms, and (particularly) hash functions, have an evident vulnerability."

Demands for accurate routing quality prediction raise to a new level to accelerate hardware innovation with advanced technology nodes. This work presents an approach that forecasts the density of all routing channels over the entire floorplan, with features collected up to placement, using conditional GANs. Specifically, forecasting the routing congestion is constructed as an image translation (colorization) problem. The proposed approach is applied to a) placement exploration for minimum congestion, b) constrained placement exploration and c) forecasting congestion in real-time during incremental placement, using eight designs targeting a fixed FPGA architecture."

The liquid clusters are highly dynamic, and continuously form and break through a mechanism attributed to the rotation of the self-propelling directions. Here we demonstrate that clusters might break through a novel instability mechanism induced by their rotational motion, and show that the efficiency of this mechanism is tamed by the frictional interaction between the particles. When this instability mechanism is present, phase separation only occurs if the density of the particles above a critical value, while conversely it occurs at all densities. The frictional dependence of this mechanism may thus allow to engineer the motility induced phase diagram by tuning the roughness of the particles."

Molvig et al., PRL~{\bf 116}, 255003 (2016)]. These nested two-shell experiments measured the pre- and post-collision outer-surface trajectory of the 7.19 g/cc chromium inner shell. Measurements of the shell trajectory are in excellent agreement with simulations; the measured outer-surface velocity was $7.52\pm0.59$ cm/$\mu$s compared to the simulated value of 7.27 cm/$\mu$s. Agreement between the measurements and simulations provides confidence in our ability to model collisions with features which have not been validated previously. Notable features include the absence of $\sim$40 mg/cc foam between shells commonly used in double shell experiments, a dense (7.19 g/cc) inner shell representative of the densities to be used at full scale, approximately mass matched ablator payload and inner shells, and the inclusion of a tamping-layer-like cushion layer for the express purpose of reducing the transfer of high mode growth to the driver shell and mediation of the shell collision. Agreement of experimental measurements with models improves our confidence in the models used to design the Revolver ignition target."

Depending on the media and the particles to be modeled, the equation has slightly different forms. In this article, we investigate a model Boltzmann equation with highly oscillatory media in the small Knudsen number regime, and study the numerical behavior of the Generalized Multi-scale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) in the fluid regime when high oscillation in the media presents. The Generalized Multi-scale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) is a general approach to numerically treat equations with multi-scale structures. The method is divided into the offline and online steps. In the offline step, basis functions are prepared from a snapshot space via a well-designed generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP), and these basis functions are then utilized to patch up for a solution through DG formulation in the online step to incorporate specific boundary and source information. We prove the wellposedness of the method on the Boltzmann equation, and show that the GEP formulation provides a set of optimal basis functions that achieve spectral convergence. Such convergence is independent of the oscillation in the media, or the smallness of the Knudsen number, making it one of the few methods that simultaneously achieve numerical homogenization and asymptotic preserving properties across all scales of oscillations and the Knudsen number."

Such equations arise often in the characterization of G-distributed random variables in a sublinear expectation space. The proposed scheme is constructed recursively based on a piecewise constant approximation of the viscosity solution to the G-equation. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate with an explicit error bound, using the comparison principles for both the scheme and the equation together with a mollification procedure. The first application is obtaining the convergence rate of Peng's robust central limit theorem with an explicit bound of Berry-Esseen type. The second application is an approximation scheme with its convergence rate for the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation."

Furthermore, recent literature suggests the phenomena of gentrification as a cause of perpetuation or increase of racial residential segregation in some American cities. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of racial residential segregation for white, black, Asian, and Hispanic citizens in New York City in the years of 1990, 2000, and 2010. It was possible to observe that segregation between white and Hispanic citizens, and discrimination between white and Asian ones has grown, while segregation between white and black is quite stable. Furthermore, we analyzed the per capita income and the Gini coefficient in each segregated zone, showing that the highest inequalities occur in the zones where there is overlap of high-density zones of pair of races. Focusing on census tracts that have changed density of population during these twenty years, and, particularly, by analyzing white and black people's segregation, our analysis reveals that a positive flux of white (black) people is associated to a substantial increase (decrease) of the property values, as compared with the city mean. Furthermore, by clustering the region of high density of black citizens, we measured the variation of area and displacement of the four biggest clusters in the period from 1990 to 2010. The large displacements (~ 1.6 Km) observed for two of these clusters, namely, one in the neighborhood of Harlem and the other inside the borough of Brooklyn, led to the emergence of typically gentrified regions."

The OT rose over 15 days to an observed luminosity of $M_r=-13$ (${\nu}L_{\nu}=9\times10^6~L_{\odot}$), in the luminosity gap between novae and typical supernovae (SNe). Spectra during the outburst show a red continuum, Balmer emission with a velocity width of $\approx400$ km s$^{-1}$, Ca II and [Ca II] emission, and absorption features characteristic of an F-type supergiant. The spectra and multiband light curves are similar to the so-called ""SN impostors"" and intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs). We directly identify the likely progenitor in archival Spitzer Space Telescope imaging with a $4.5~\mu$m luminosity of $M_{[4.5]}\approx-12.2$ and a $[3.6]-[4.5]$ color redder than 0.74 mag, similar to those of the prototype ILRTs SN 2008S and NGC 300 OT2008-1. Intensive monitoring of M51 with Spitzer further reveals evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate at [4.5] in the years before the OT. The progenitor is not detected in pre-outburst Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR images. The optical colors during outburst combined with spectroscopic temperature constraints imply a higher reddening of $E(B-V)\approx0.7$ mag and higher intrinsic luminosity of $M_r\approx-14.9$ (${\nu}L_{\nu}=5.3\times10^7~L_{\odot}$) near peak than seen in previous ILRT candidates. Moreover, the extinction estimate is higher on the rise than on the plateau, suggestive of an extended phase of circumstellar dust destruction. These results, enabled by the early discovery of M51 OT2019-1 and extensive pre-outburst archival coverage, offer new clues about the debated origins of ILRTs and may challenge the hypothesis that they arise from the electron-capture induced collapse of extreme asymptotic giant branch stars."

The peculiar light curve has two roughly equal brightness peaks ($\approx -19$ mag) separated by 100 days, and a subsequent slow decline by 5 mag in 650 rest-frame days. The spectra are dominated by emission lines of calcium and oxygen, with a width of only $3400$ km s$^{-1}$, superposed on a strong blue continuum in the first year, and with a large ratio of $L_{\rm [Ca\,II]}/L_{\rm [O\,I]}\approx 4$ at late times. There is no clear evidence for hydrogen or helium associated with the SN at any phase. We model the light curves with several potential energy sources: radioactive decay, central engine, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. Regardless of the model, the inferred progenitor mass near the end of its life (i.e., CO core mass) is $\gtrsim 55$ M$_\odot$ and up to $120$ M$_\odot$, placing the event in the regime of pulsational pair instability supernovae (PPISNe) or pair instability supernovae (PISNe). The models of CSM interaction provide the most consistent explanation for the light curves and spectra, and require a CSM mass of $\approx 35$ M$_\odot$ ejected in the final decade before explosion. We further find that SN 2016iet is located at an unusually large offset ($16.5$ kpc) from its low metallicity dwarf host galaxy ($Z\approx 0.1$ Z$_\odot$, $M\approx 10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$), supporting the PPISN/PISN interpretation. In the final spectrum, we detect narrow H$\alpha$ emission at the SN location, likely due to a dim underlying galaxy host or an H II region. Despite the overall consistency of the SN and its unusual environment with PPISNe and PISNe, we find that the inferred properties of SN\,2016iet challenge existing models of such events."

For example, it can undergo expansion which decelerates to a minimum rate, passes through a `cosmic jerk,' then accelerates.

For the standard gravitational central force, it recovers the deep MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) (accelerations $\ll a_0\approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^{2}$) equations of motion in the case of a circular orbit. Perturbations to that turn on higher derivative terms, leading to exponentially unstable solutions that must vanish in order to account for the very small scattering of the Tully-Fisher relation. Unstable solutions linearly growing with time remain valid for a characteristic timescale of at least 3 billion years. We show that vertical perturbations recover similar results to dark matter for old galaxies, but deviations could be present for young ones. We also present ways to probe our approach and describe some of its subtleties, such as the strong equivalence principle (violated in general), the center of mass motion of a composite body, and how in some cases it could overcome Ostrogradsky's instabilities (with naturally occurring piecewise Lagrangians). Our main conclusions regarding our MOND-like proposal are: (i) it constitutes a possible recipe where Ostrogradsky instabilities could be ""tamed""; (ii) it is a falsifiable approach in various contexts and (iii) it might explain simultaneously some of the issues usual modified gravity MOND and dark matter phenomenologies have difficulties individually. These aspects seem relevant to start addressing practical ways to differentiate modified gravity MOND from modified inertia and give insights into alternative ways to tackle some astrophysical and cosmological puzzles."

We report on a methodical investigation into differences in face recognition accuracy between African-American and Caucasian image cohorts of the MORPH dataset. We find that, for all four matchers considered, the impostor and the genuine distributions are statistically significantly different between cohorts. For a fixed decision threshold, the African-American image cohort has a higher false match rate and a lower false non-match rate. ROC curves compare verification rates at the same false match rate, but the different cohorts achieve the same false match rate at different thresholds. This means that ROC comparisons are not relevant to operational scenarios that use a fixed decision threshold. We show that, for the ResNet matcher, the two cohorts have approximately equal separation of impostor and genuine distributions. Using ICAO compliance as a standard of image quality, we find that the initial image cohorts have unequal rates of good quality images. The ICAO-compliant subsets of the original image cohorts show improved accuracy, with the main effect being to reducing the low-similarity tail of the genuine distributions."

From this sample, we create an `ancient infallers' and `recent infallers' subsample, based on the mean infall time predicted from cosmological simulations for galaxies with their location in phase-space. We compare the stellar mass growth histories of the galaxies in these two subsamples, as determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting that uses a comprehensive library of star formation history shapes derived from cosmological simulations. By simultaneously controlling for satellite stellar mass and host halo mass, we can clearly see the impact of time spent in their hosts. As we might predict, the ancient infaller population shows clear signs of earlier quenching, especially for lower mass satellites in more massive hosts. More importantly, we find the effects are not limited to massive hosts. We find that hosts which might be considered low mass groups (halo masses $\sim$10$^{13}$ M$_\odot$) can significantly alter their satellites, even for massive satellites (stellar masses $\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$). Intriguingly, we see changes in the mass growth history of the satellites of clusters as early as 8 or 9 Gyr ago, when they had not yet entered the virial radius of their current host. We propose that this could be the result of galaxies being pre-processed in low-mass substructures in the protocluster outskirts, prior to infall."

A   less biased view of the early co-evolution of black holes and host galaxies,"We present ALMA [CII] line and far-infrared (FIR) continuum observations of three $z > 6$ low-luminosity quasars ($M_{\rm 1450} > -25$) discovered by our Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The [CII] line was detected in all three targets with luminosities of $(2.4 - 9.5) \times 10^8~L_\odot$, about one order of magnitude smaller than optically luminous ($M_{\rm 1450} \lesssim -25$) quasars. The FIR continuum luminosities range from $< 9 \times 10^{10}~L_\odot$ (3$\sigma$ limit) to $\sim 2 \times 10^{12}~L_\odot$, indicating a wide range in star formation rates in these galaxies. Most of the HSC quasars studied thus far show [CII]/FIR luminosity ratios similar to local star-forming galaxies. Using the [CII]-based dynamical mass ($M_{\rm dyn}$) as a surrogate for bulge stellar mass ($M_{\rm bulge}$), we find that a significant fraction of low-luminosity quasars are located on or even below the local $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relation, particularly at the massive end of the galaxy mass distribution. In contrast, previous studies of optically luminous quasars have found that black holes are overmassive relative to the local relation. Given the low luminosities of our targets, we are exploring the nature of the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their hosts in a less biased way. Almost all of the quasars presented in this work are growing their black hole mass at much higher pace at $z \sim 6$ than the parallel growth model, in which supermassive black holes and their hosts grow simultaneously to match the local $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relation at all redshifts. As the low-luminosity quasars appear to realize the local co-evolutionary relation even at $z \sim 6$, they should have experienced vigorous starbursts prior to the currently observed quasar phase to catch up with the relation."

Judicious orderings of events enable solvers to efficiently make decisions over sequences of actions to satisfy complex hybrid specifications. The ordering problem is thus fundamental to planning. Promising recent works have explored the ordering problem as search, incorporating a special tree structure for efficiency. However, such approaches only reason over partial order specifications. Having observed that an ordering is inconsistent with respect to underlying constraints, prior works do not exploit the tree structure to efficiently generate orderings that resolve the inconsistency. In this paper, we present Conflict-directed Incremental Total Ordering (CDITO), a conflict-directed search method to incrementally and systematically generate event total orders given ordering relations and conflicts returned by sub-solvers. Due to its ability to reason over conflicts, CDITO is much more efficient than Incremental Total Ordering. We demonstrate this by benchmarking on temporal network configuration problems that involve routing network flows and allocating bandwidth resources over time."

In this DMS material the concentration of magnetic moments can be controlled independently from the concentration of electric charge carriers that are required for mediating magnetic interactions between these moments. This feature allows us to separately investigate the effect of carriers and of spins on the ferromagnetic properties of this new DMS alloy, and particularly of the critical ferromagnetic behavior. We use modified Arrott plot technique to establish critical exponents b, g, and d of this alloy. We find that at low Mn concentrations (< 10 at.%), it is governed by short-range 3D-Ising behavior, with experimental values of b, g, and d very close to theoretical 3D-Ising values of 0.325, 1.24, and 4.815. However, as the Mn concentration increases, this DMS material exhibits a mixed-phase behavior, with g retaining its 3D-Ising characteristics, but b crossing over to longer-range mean-field behavior."

To achieve higher efficiency of EH, we propose a new PS-based EH architecture at the relay by incorporating an alternating current (AC) computing logic, which is employed to directly use the wirelessly harvested AC energy for computational blocks. Under a nonlinear EH circuit, our goal is to maximize the fairness of end-to-end rate among user pairs subject to power constraints, resulting in a nonconvex problem.

However, influencing the fundamental properties is still challenging and requires sophisticated surface or dimensionality manipulation. In this work, we present such a modification for the example of colloidal lead sulphide nanowires. We show that the electrical properties of lead sulphide nanostructures can be altered from semiconducting to metallic with indications of superconductivity, by exploiting the flexibility of the colloidal synthesis to sculpt the crystal and to form different surface facets. A particular morphology of lead sulphide nanowires has been synthesized through the formation of {111} surface facets, which shows metallic and superconducting properties in contrast to other forms of this semiconducting crystal, which contain other surface facets ({100} and {110}).

Such sequences are complete and form a basis of the space for any arbitrary polynomial. In this paper, we introduce some incomplete sets of finite orthogonal polynomials that do not contain all degrees but they are solutions of some symmetric generalized Sturm-Liouville problems. Although such polynomials do not possess all properties as in classical cases, they can be applied to functions approximation theory as we will compute their explicit norm square values."

The results are based on the analysis of recent Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations. Five outflow systems are identified, where in total they include $\sim$70 outflow troughs from ionic transitions. These include the first non-solar detections from transitions of O V*, Ne V*, Ar VI, Ca VI, Ca VII, and Ca VIII. The appearance of very high-ionization species (e.g., Ne VIII, Na IX, and Mg X) in all outflows necessitates at least two-ionization phases for the observed outflows. We develop an interactive Synthetic Spectral Simulation method to fit the multitude of observed troughs. Detections of density sensitive troughs (e.g., S IV* $\lambda$ 657.32 $\r{A}$ and the O V* multiplet) allow us to determine the distance of the outflows ($R$) as well as their energetics. Two of the outflows are at $R$ $\simeq$ 800 pc and one is at $R$ $\simeq$ 15 pc. One of the outflows has the highest kinetic luminosity on record ($\dot{E_{k}}$ $ = 5\times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which is 20% of its Eddington luminosity. Such a large ratio suggests that this outflow can provide the energy needed for active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms."

Four Similar Outflows in 2MASS J1051+1247 with Enough Energy to be Major   Contributors to AGN Feedback,"We detect four very energetic outflows in the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph spectra of quasar 2MASS J1051+1247 with a combined kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of 10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Remarkable similarities are seen in these outflows: velocity centroids between 4900 and 5700 km s$^{-1}$, distances from the central source ($R$) of a few hundred parsecs that are all consistent within the errors, and an $\dot{E_k}$ within a factor of two for all outflows. Hence, a common origin for the outflows is probable. Most of the outflowing mass resides in a very high-ionization phase evident by troughs from Ne VIII, Na IX, Mg X, and Si XII, which connect the physical conditions of these ultraviolet outflows to the X-ray warm absorber outflows seen in nearby Seyfert galaxies. Three of the outflows have two or three independent diagnostics for the electron number density, yielding consistent values for each outflow, which increase the robustness of the $R$ determinations. Troughs from never-before-seen ionic transitions of Ar VI, O IV*, Ne VI*, and Ne V* are identified. With a combined $\dot{E_k}$ that is $7.0^{+6.5}_{-2.3}$ % of the quasar's Eddington luminosity, these outflows are prime candidates to be major agents for various active galactic nuclei feedback effects."

In S2, for the first time we clearly detect absorption troughs from Ca IV, Ca V, Ca V*, Ca VII*, and Ca VIII*. The column density measurement of Ca V suggests S2 has a super-solar metallicity. Both outflows require at least two ionization phases where the column density of the very high-ionization phase is roughly 15 times larger than the corresponding high-ionization phase. These high column densities and very high-ionization potential ions are similar to X-ray warm absorbers. The two phases of S2 show a unique velocity centroid shift between associated troughs. Through Monte Carlo measurements of the O V* absorption troughs, we determine the electron number density of S2 (fully corroborated by independent measurements from the Ca V* and Ca VIII* troughs), yielding a distance of 9 pc and a kinetic luminosity of 2$\times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. S1 is located farther away at 500 pc from the central source with a kinetic luminosity of 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$."

Formamide (HCONH2) is the simplest molecule containing the peptide bond first detected in the gas phase in Orion-KL and SgrB2. In recent years, it has been observed in high temperature regions such as hot corinos, where thermal desorption is responsible for the sublimation of frozen mantles into the gas phase. The interpretation of observations can benefit from information gathered in the laboratory, where it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption process and to study formamide under simulated space conditions such as UV irradiation. Methods. Here, two laboratory analyses are reported: we studied formamide photo-stability under UV irradiation when it is adsorbed by space relevant minerals at 63 K and in the vacuum regime. We also investigated temperature programmed desorption of pure formamide ice in the presence of TiO2 dust before and after UV irradiation. Results. Through these analyses, the effects of UV degradation and the interaction between formamide and different minerals are compared.We find that silicates, both hydrates and anhydrates, offer molecules a higher level of protection from UV degradation than mineral oxides. The desorption temperature found for pure formamide is 220 K. The desorption temperature increases to 250 K when the formamide desorbs from the surface of TiO2 grains. Conclusions. Through the experiments outlined here, it is possible to follow the desorption of formamide and its fragments, simulate the desorption process in star forming regions and hot corinos, and constrain parameters such as the thermal desorption temperature of formamide and its fragments and the binding energies involved. Our results offer support to observational data and improve our understanding of the role of the grain surface in enriching the chemistry in space."

Thus, the methods proposed for recognizing human actions in videos cannot be applied to still images. A big challenge in action recognition in still images is the lack of large enough datasets, which is problematic for training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to the overfitting issue. In this paper, by taking advantage of pre-trained CNNs, we employ the transfer learning technique to tackle the lack of massive labeled action recognition datasets. Furthermore, since the last layer of the CNN has class-specific information, we apply an attention mechanism on the output feature maps of the CNN to extract more discriminative and powerful features for classification of human actions. Moreover, we use eight different pre-trained CNNs in our framework and investigate their performance on Stanford 40 dataset. Finally, we propose using the Ensemble Learning technique to enhance the overall accuracy of action classification by combining the predictions of multiple models. The best setting of our method is able to achieve 93.17$\%$ accuracy on the Stanford 40 dataset."

The cognitive radio (CR) technology can improve spectrum utilization in an opportunistic communication manner for IoT, forming a promising paradigm known as cognitive radio ad hoc networks,CRAHNs. However, dynamic spectrum availability and mobile devices/persons make it difficult to develop an efficient data transmission scheme for CRAHNs under an obstacle environment. Opportunistic routing can leverage the broadcast nature of wireless channels to enhance network performance. Inspired by this, in this paper, we propose an Obstacle aware Opportunistic Data Transmission scheme (OODT) in CRAHNs from a computational geometry perspective, considering energy efficiency and social features. In the proposed scheme, we exploit a new routing metric, which is based on an obstacle avoiding algorithm using a polygon boundary 1-searcher technology, and an auction model for selecting forwarding candidates. In addition, we prove that the candidate selection problem is NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm for candidate selection. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance than existing schemes."

About 23% of the sources listed in this catalog are unidentified/unassociated gamma-ray sources while ~26% of the sources are classified as blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), lacking optical spectroscopic information. To probe the blazar nature of candidate counterparts of UGSs and BCUs, we started our optical spectroscopic follow up campaign in 2012, which up to date account for more than 350 observed sources. In this paper, the tenth of our campaign, we report on the spectroscopic observations of 37 sources, mostly BCUs, whose observations were carried out predominantly at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir and the Southern Astrophysical Research Observatory between August 2018 and September 2019. We confirm the BL Lac nature of 27 sources and the flat spectrum radio quasar nature of three sources. The remaining ones are classified as six BL Lacs galaxy-dominated and one normal galaxy. We were also able to measure the redshifts for 20 sources, including 10 BL Lacs. As in previous analyses, the largest fraction of BCUs revealed to be BL Lac objects."

The GHZ states of the N-group qubits are generated by using N-group qutrits placed in the N cavities. Here, ""qutrit"" refers to a three-level quantum system with the two lowest levels representing a qubit while the third level acting as an intermediate state necessary for the GHZ state creation. This proposal does not depend on the architecture of the cavity-based quantum network and the way for coupling the cavities. The operation time is independent of the number of qubits. The GHZ states are prepared deterministically because no measurement on the states of qutrits or cavities is needed. In addition, the third energy level of the qutrits during the entire operation is virtually excited and thus decoherence from higher energy levels is greatly suppressed. This proposal is quite general and can in principle be applied to create GHZ states of many qubits using different types of physical qutrits (e.g., atoms, quantum dots, NV centers, various superconducting qutrits, etc.) distributed in multiple cavities. As a specific example, we further discuss the experimental feasibility of preparing a GHZ state of four-group transmon qubits (each group consisting of three qubits) distributed in four one-dimensional transmission line resonators arranged in an array."

Recent research has shown that the public's understanding of RAI can be negative or inaccurate. We believe effective public engagement can help ensure that public opinion is better informed. In this paper, we describe our first iteration of a high throughput in-person public engagement activity. We describe the use of a light touch quiz-format survey instrument to integrate in-the-wild research participation into the engagement, allowing us to probe both the effectiveness of our engagement strategy, and public perceptions of the future roles of robots and humans working in dangerous settings, such as in the off-shore energy sector. We critique our methods and share interesting results into generational differences within the public's view of the future of Robotics and AI in hazardous environments. These findings include that older peoples' views about the future of robots in hazardous environments were not swayed by exposure to our exhibit, while the views of younger people were affected by our exhibit, leading us to consider carefully in future how to more effectively engage with and inform older people."

In particular, the effect of complex interconnections among financial institutions on financial stability has been widely recognized. A recent debate focused on the effects of unconventional policies aimed at achieving both price and financial stability. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE, i.e., the large-scale asset purchase programme conducted by a central bank upon the creation of new money) has been recently implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). In this context, two questions deserve more attention in the literature. First, to what extent, by injecting liquidity, the QE may alter the bank-firm lending level and stimulate the real economy. Second, to what extent the QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial actors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension funds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we address these two questions by developing a methodology to map the macro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across financial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our approach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public securities purchased within the QE). We then test the effect of the implementation of ECB's QE on the time evolution of the financial linkages in the macro-network of the euro area, as well as the effect on macroeconomic variables, such as output and prices."

This comes at a cost to the developer, who now needs to reason more about correctness of communication patterns in their application as web applications support more complex communication patterns.   Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a framework for verifying conformance of implementations to their prescribed communication protocol. Existing proposals for applying the MPST framework in application developments either neglect the event-driven nature of web applications, or lack compatibility with industry tools and practices, which discourages mainstream adoption by web developers.   In this paper, we present an implementation of the MPST framework for developing interactive web applications using familiar industry tools using TypeScript and the React.js framework. The developer can use the Scribble protocol language to specify the protocol and use the Scribble toolchain to validate and obtain the local protocol for each role. The local protocol describes the interactions of the global communication protocol observed by the role. We encode the local protocol into TypeScript types, catering for server-side and client-side targets separately. We show that our encoding guarantees that only implementations which conform to the protocol can type-check. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a web-based implementation of the classic Noughts and Crosses game from an MPST formalism of the game logic."

With small gaps there, the adiabatic limit for the existing formulations of Hall current can be exceeded in a moderate electric field. Here we present a theory of non-adiabatic Hall effect, capturing non-perturbatively the across gap electron-hole excitations by the electric field. We find a general connection between the field induced electron-hole coherence and intrinsic Hall velocity. In coherent evolution, the electron-hole coherence can manifest as a sizeable ac Hall velocity. When environmental noise is taken into account, its joint action with the electric field favors a form of electron-hole coherence that is function of wavevector and field only, leading to a dc nonlinear Hall effect. The Hall current has all odd order terms in field, and still retains the intrinsic role of the Berry curvature. The quantitative demonstration uses the example of gapped Dirac cones, and our theory can be used to describe the bulk pseudospin Hall current in insulators with gapped edge such as graphene and 2D MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$"

A generalized quantum optical scheme for implementing OQWs that includes non-zero temperature of the environment is suggested. In the proposed quantum optical scheme, a two-level atom plays the role of the ""walker"", and the Fock states of the cavity mode correspond to the lattice sites for the ""walker"". Using the small unitary rotations approach the effective dynamics of the system is shown to be an OQW. For the chosen set of parameters, an increase in the temperature of the environment causes the system to reach the asymptotic distribution much faster compared to the scheme proposed earlier where the temperature of the environment is zero. For this case the asymptotic distribution is given by a steady Gaussian distribution."

In this paper, we focus on two aspects of challenges: i) Since salient objects appear in various sizes, using single-scale convolution would not capture the right size. Moreover, using multi-scale convolutions without considering their importance may confuse the model. ii) Employing multi-level features helps the model use both local and global context. However, treating all features equally results in information redundancy. Therefore, there needs to be a mechanism to intelligently select which features in different levels are useful. To address the first challenge, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Guided Module. This module not only extracts multi-scale features effectively but also gives more attention to more discriminative feature maps corresponding to the scale of the salient object. To address the second challenge, we propose an Attention-based Multi-level Integrator Module to give the model the ability to assign different weights to multi-level feature maps. Furthermore, our Sharpening Loss function guides our network to output saliency maps with higher certainty and less blurry salient objects, and it has far better performance than the Cross-entropy loss. For the first time, we adopt four different backbones to show the generalization of our method. Experiments on five challenging datasets prove that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our approach is fast as well and can run at a real-time speed."

We engineered highly dense arrays of gold nanorod antennas featuring polarization-sensitive localized plasmon resonances, tunable over a broadband near- and mid-infrared (IR) spectrum, in overlap with the so-called 'functional group' window. We demonstrate polarization-sensitive SEIRA activity, homogeneous over macroscopic areas and stable in time, by exploiting prototype self-assembled monolayers of IR-active octadecanthiol (ODT) molecules. The strong coupling between the plasmonic excitation and molecular stretching modes gives rise to characteristic Fano resonances in SEIRA. The SO engineering of the active hotspots in the arrays allows us to achieve signal amplitude improved up to 5.7%. This figure is competitive to the response of lithographic nanoantennas and is stable when the optical excitation spot varies from the micro- to macroscale, thus enabling highly sensitive SEIRA spectroscopy with cost-effective nanosensor devices."

Further, we introduce an adiabatic wall as internal constrain into the lattice and examine the stored energy with respect to different positions of the internal constrain. We found that the stored energy for constrained systems are larger than their unconstrained counterpart.

We use multiplexed near-infrared H band spectroscopy from the SDSS-III and -IV APOGEE instrument and optical spectroscopy from the HET High-Resolution Spectrograph to derive double-lined spectroscopic orbits and dynamical mass-ratios for the EB sample. This information is combined with Kepler photometry to derive orbital inclination, dynamical masses of the components, radii and temperatures. These measurements are directly applicable for benchmarking stellar models that are integrating the next generation of improvements, such as the magnetic suppression of convection efficiency, updated opacity tables, and fine-tuned equations of state. We selected our EB sample to include systems with low-mass ($M \lt 0.8 \; M_{\odot}$) primary or secondary components, many expected to populate the relatively sparse parameter space below $0.5 \; M_{\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our EB sample and the analysis techniques we are utilizing, and present masses and radii for two systems that inhabit particularly underpopulated regions of mass-radius-period space: KIC 2445134 and KIC 3003991.

The crystallographic orientation dependent wet etch of single crystalline silicon in potassium hydroxide (KOH) allows a range of shapes formed and has significant impacts on MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), AFM (atomic force microscopy), and microfluidics. Here, a crystal direction dependent dry etching principle in an inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion etcher is presented, which allows to selectively reveal desired crystal planes in monocrystalline diamond by controlling the etching conditions. The principle is demonstrated when the kinetic energy of incident ions on diamond surfaces is reduced below a certain threshold leading to anisotropic etching and faceting along specific crystal planes. Using the principle, monolithic diamond nanopillars for magnetometry using nitrogen vacancy centers are fabricated. In these nanopillars, a half-tapering angle up to 21{\deg} is achieved, the highest angle reported, which leads to a high photon efficiency and high mechanical strength of the nanopillar. These results represent the first demonstration of crystallographic orientation dependent reactive ion etch principle, which opens a new window for shaping specific nanostructures which is at the heart of nanotechnology. It is believed that this principle will prove to be valuable for structuring and patterning of other single crystal materials as well."

We examine the low vanadium substitution regime: x = 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02. The intercalation reaction significantly increases the critical temperature (Tc) and the superfluid stiffness for all x. The nonintercalated samples all exhibit Tc = 8.5 K while the intercalated samples all show an enhanced Tc > 40 K. Vanadium substitution has a negligible effect on Tc, but seems to suppress the superfluid stiffness for the nonintercalated samples and weakly enhance it for the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated samples is found to be x = 0.01, with Tc = 41 K and {\lambda}_{ab}(0) = 0.18 {\mu}m. The nonintercalated samples can be modeled with either a single d-wave superconducting gap or with an anisotropic gap function based on recent quasiparticle imaging experiments, whereas the intercalates display multigap nodal behavior which can be fitted using s + d- or d + d-wave models. Magnetism, likely from iron impurities, appears after the intercalation reaction and coexists and competes with the superconductivity. However, it appears that the superconductivity is remarkably robust to the impurity phase, providing an avenue to stably improve the superconducting properties of transition metal substituted FeSe."

As a model system we choose the double quantum dot coupled to one metallic and one superconducting electrode in the T-shape geometry. The analysis is particularly valuable for systems containing coupled objects with considerably different broadening of energy levels. In such systems, the scattering of itinerant electrons on a discrete (or narrow) energy level gives rise to the Fano-type interference. Systems with induced superconducting order, along well understood Fano resonances, exhibit also another features on the opposite side of the Fermi level. The lineshape of these resonances differs significantly from their reflection on the opposite side of the Fermi level, and their origin was not fully understood. Here, considering the spin-polarized tunneling model, we explain a microscopic mechanism of a formation of these resonances and discuss the nature of their uncommon lineshapes.

We investigate also the interplay of each type of resonances with the Kondo physics and discuss the resonant features in differential conductivity."

Since these systems are far from equilibrium, their dynamics and energetics cannot be understood using the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics extend classical concepts of work, heat, and energy dissipation to fluctuating non-equilibrium systems. We use recent advances in experiment and theory to study the non-thermal dissipation of individual light-activated self-propelled colloidal particles. We focus on characterizing the transition from thermal to non-thermal fluctuations and show that energy dissipation rates on the order of $\sim k_BT/$s are measurable from finite time series data."

Noticeable portion of molecules in the ensemble show a behavior which is inconsistent with the standard tunneling model: Their spectral lines are subject to irreversible spectral jumps, continuous shifting, and abrupt chaotic changes of the linewidth or jumping rate. In films thinner than 100 nm, the occurrence of ""non-standard"" spectral behavior increases with decreasing sample thickness at fixed excitation intensity. In addition, it also increases with laser intensity."

Considered is a cooperative cognitive radio network, where two IoT devices (IoDs) exchange their information and also provide relay assistance to a pair of primary users (PUs). Different from most existing works, in this paper, both IoDs can harvest energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signals received from the PUs. By utilizing the harvested energy, they provide relay cooperation to PUs and realize their own communications. For harvesting energy, a time-switching (TS) based approach is adopted at both IoDs. With the proposed scheme, one round of bidirectional information exchange for both primary and IoT systems is performed in four phases, i.e., one energy harvesting (EH) phase and three information processing (IP) phases. Both IoDs rely on the decode-and-forward operation to facilitate relaying, whereas the PUs employ selection combining (SC) technique. For investigating the performance of the considered network, this paper first provides exact expressions of user outage probability (OP) for the primary and IoT systems under Nakagami-m fading. Then, by utilizing the expressions of user OP, the system throughput and energy efficiency are quantified together with the average end-to-end transmission time. Numerical and simulation results are provided to give useful insights into the system behavior and to highlight the impact of various system/channel parameters."

FB-2 demonstrates a new UV detector technology, the delta-doped Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD), in a low risk suborbital environment, to prove the performance of EMCCDs for future space missions and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) advancement. EMCCDs can be used in photon counting (PC) mode to achieve extremely low readout noise ($<$1 electron). Our testing has focused on reducing clock-induced-charge (CIC) through wave shaping and well depth optimization with a \nuvu V2 CCCP Controller, measuring CIC at 0.001 e$^{-}$/pixel/frame. This optimization also includes methods for reducing dark current, via cooling, and substrate voltage levels. We discuss the challenges of removing cosmic rays, which are also amplified by these detectors, as well as a data reduction pipeline designed for our noise measurement objectives. FB-2 flew in 2018, providing the first time an EMCCD was used for UV observations in the stratosphere. FB-2 is currently being built up to fly again in 2020, and improvements are being made to the EMCCD to continue optimizing its performance for better noise control."

In contrast to prescriptive interfaces, the work's real-time affective interface engages the audience in the iterative conceptualisation of their emotional state through the use of affectively-charged machine generated poetry. The audience are encouraged to make sense of the mirror's poetry by framing it with respect to their recent life experiences, effectively `putting into words' their felt emotion. This process of affect labelling and contextualisation works to not only regulate emotion, but helps to construct the rich personal narratives that constitute human identity."

The theory of scalar electrodynamics coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity can be formulated as a constrained 3BF theory for a specific choice of the gauge 3-group. The complete Hamiltonian analysis of the 3BF action for the choice of a Lie 3-group corresponding to scalar electrodynamics is performed. This analysis is the first step towards a canonical quantization of a 3BF theory, an important stepping stone for the quantization of the complete scalar electrodynamics coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity formulated as a 3BF action with suitable simplicity constraints. It is shown that the resulting dynamic constraints eliminate all propagating degrees of freedom, i.e., the 3BF theory for this choice of a 3-group is a topological field theory, as expected."

The NBN appears only when electric-current density exceeds a threshold value, indicating that the current-driven motion of the skyrmion lattice triggers the NBN. The observed NBN frequency is 10-10$^4$ Hz at $\sim$10$^{9}$ A/m$^{2}$, implying a skyrmion steady flow velocity of 1-100 $\mu$m/s, 3-5 orders of magnitude slower than previously reported. The temperature evolution of the NBN frequency suggests that the steady flow entails thermally activated processes, which are most likely due to skyrmion creation and annihilation at the sample edges. This scenario is qualitatively supported by our numerical simulations considering boundary effects, which reveals that the edges limit the steady flow of skyrmions, especially at low temperatures. We discuss a mechanism that dramatically slows the skyrmion steady flow in a microfabricated specimen."

Methods and Materials: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 4508 cases from the UK Biobank were split randomly into 3244 training and 812 validation cases, and 452 test cases. Ground truth myocardial landmarks were defined and tracked by manual initialization and correction of deformable image registration using previously validated software with five readers. The fully automatic framework consisted of 1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for localization, and 2) a combination of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a CNN to detect and track the myocardial landmarks through the image sequence for each slice. Radial and circumferential strain were then calculated from the motion of the landmarks and averaged on a slice basis. Results: Within the test set, myocardial end-systolic circumferential Green strain errors were -0.001 +/- 0.025, -0.001 +/- 0.021, and 0.004 +/- 0.035 in basal, mid, and apical slices respectively (mean +/- std. dev. of differences between predicted and manual strain). The framework reproduced significant reductions in circumferential strain in diabetics, hypertensives, and participants with previous heart attack. Typical processing time was ~260 frames (~13 slices) per second on an NVIDIA Tesla K40 with 12GB RAM, compared with 6-8 minutes per slice for the manual analysis. Conclusions: The fully automated RNNCNN framework for analysis of myocardial strain enabled unbiased strain evaluation in a high-throughput workflow, with similar ability to distinguish impairment due to diabetes, hypertension, and previous heart attack."

Apart from serving as a collections center for growth species, the gold droplets carry an additional crucial role that necessarily precedes the nanowire emergence, that is, they assist the nucleation of nanocraters with strongly faceted 111B side walls. Only once these facets become sufficiently large and regular, the gold droplets start nucleating and guiding the growth of nanowires. We show that this dual role of the gold droplets can be detected and monitored by high energy electron diffraction during growth. Moreover, gold induced formation of craters and the onset of nanowires growth on the 111B facets inside the craters are confirmed by the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The detailed insight into the growth mechanism of inclined nanowires will help to engineer new and complex nanowire based device architectures."

Three of the four efforts led to positive detections of the body, and all constrained the presence of rings and other debris, finding none. Twenty-five mobile stations were deployed for 2017 June 3 and augmented by fixed telescopes. There were no positive detections from this effort. The event on 2017 July 10 was observed by SOFIA with one very short chord. Twenty-four deployed stations on 2017 July 17 resulted in five chords that clearly showed a complicated shape consistent with a contact binary with rough dimensions of 20 by 30 km for the overall outline. A visible albedo of 10% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were deployed for the fourth event on 2018 Aug 4 and resulted in two chords. The combination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a significant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380 $\pm$ 0.0005 hours. The occultation data also provided high-precision astrometric constraints on the position of the object that were crucial for supporting the navigation for the New Horizons flyby. This work demonstrates an effective method for obtaining detailed size and shape information and probing for rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important source of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is particularly useful for small and distant bodies."

The total cross sections as well as the differential cross sections depending on the scattering angle are evaluated in an effective Lagrangian approach. Our estimations indicate that magnitude of the cross sections strongly depends on the model parameter but such dependence can be almost completely canceled for the cross section ratios. These model independent ratios can be taken as a good criterion of the validity of heavy quark limit in the charmed region, which is helpful to understand $P$-wave charmed and charmed-strange mesons."

With existing PSF construction methods, the circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably altered by over-fitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling--free solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential non-negative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF). DI-sNMF first converts this signal separation problem to a ""missing data"" problem in statistics by flagging the regions which host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to these regions. We mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which thus enables precise measurement for these circumstellar objects. We apply it to simulated point source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) K1-band observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of signals is needed."

In this paper, we use a 3D residual attention network which is trained end to end for hand gesture recognition. Based on the stacked multiple attention blocks, we build a 3D network which generates different features at each attention block. Our 3D attention based residual network (Res3ATN) can be built and extended to very deep layers. Using this network, an extensive analysis is performed on other 3D networks based on three publicly available datasets. The Res3ATN network performance is compared to C3D, ResNet-10, and ResNext-101 networks. We also study and evaluate our baseline network with different number of attention blocks. The comparison shows that the 3D residual attention network with 3 attention blocks is robust in attention learning and is able to classify the gestures with better accuracy, thus outperforming existing networks."

These models are constructed by considering maximally O(M)-symmetric multicomponent scalar models, whose symmetry is partially gauged to obtain SU(N_c) gauge theories, with a residual nonabelian global symmetry given by U(N_f) for N_c>2 and Sp(N_f) for N_c=2, so that M = 2 N_c N_f. We find that their finite-temperature transition is continuous for N_f=2 and for all values of Nc we investigated, N_c=2,3,4. Such continuous transitions belong to universality classes related to the global symmetry group of the theory. For N_c=2 it belongs to the SO(5)=Sp(2)/Z_2 universality class, while for N_c>2 it belongs to the SO(3)=SU(2)/Z_2 universality class. For N_f>2, the transition is always of first order. These results match the predictions obtained by using the effective Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach in terms of a gauge-invariant order parameter. Our results indicate that the nonabelian gauge degrees of freedom are irrelevant at the transition. These conclusions are supported by an analysis of gauge-field dependent correlation functions, that are always short-ranged, even at the transition."

Focusing of electron and positron beams by wakefield, excited in plasma, in electron-positron collider is very important. The focusing mechanism in the plasma, in which all electron bunches of a sequence are focused identically, has been proposed by authors earlier. The mechanism of focusing of a sequence of relativistic positron bunches in plasma, in which all positron bunches of sequence are focused identically and uniformly, has been investigated in this paper by numerical simulation by 2.5D code LCODE. We numerically simulate the self-consistent radial dynamics of lengthy positron bunches in homogeneous plasma. In simulation we use the hydrodynamic description of plasma. In other words, the plasma is considered to be cold electron liquid, and positron bunches are aggregate of macroparticles. Positron bunches are considered to be homogeneous cylinders in the longitudinal direction. Positrons in bunches are distributed in radial direction according to Gaussian distribution. It is shown that in this case only first bunch is in the finite longitudinal electrical wakefield notequal to zero. Other bunches are in zero longitudinal electrical wakefield Ez=0. Between bunches of this sequence longitudinal electrical wakefield and radial force are not zero. The focusing radial force in regions, occupied by bunches, is constant along each bunch Fr=const. Between bunches the radial force is inhomogeneous. All positron bunches of sequence are focused identically and uniformly."

Our database collects thermal emission measurements of small Solar Systems targets that are otherwise available in scattered sources and gives a complete description of the data, with all information necessary to perform direct scientific analyses and without the need to access additional, external resources. This public database contains representative data of asteroid observations of large surveys (e.g. AKARI, IRAS and WISE) as well as a collection of small body observations of infrared space telescopes (e.g. the Herschel Space Observatory) and provides a web interface to access this data (https://ird.konkoly.hu). We also provide an example for the direct application of the database and show how it can be used to estimate the thermal inertia of specific populations, e.g. asteroids within a given size range. We show how different scalings of thermal inertia with heliocentric distance (i.e. temperature) may affect our interpretation of the data and discuss why the widely-used radiative conductivity exponent ($\alpha$=-3/4) might not be adequate in general, as hinted by previous studies."

The typical hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase has been extensively studied, but relatively little attention has been paid to the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, which has been shown to nucleate in confined structures and may be present in tight-pitch interconnects. Using \emph{ab initio} techniques, we benchmark the performance of fcc Ru. We find that the phonon-limited bulk resistivity of the fcc Ru is less than half of that of hcp Ru, a feature we trace back to the stronger electron-phonon coupling elements that are geometrically inherited from the modified Fermi surface shape of the fcc crystal. Despite this benefit of the fcc phase, high grain boundary scattering results in increased resistivity compared to Cu-based interconnects with similar average grain size. We find, however, that the line resistance of fcc Ru is lower than that of Cu below 21 nm line width due to the conductor volume lost to adhesion and wetting liners. In addition to studying bulk transport properties, we evaluate the performance of adhesion liners for fcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for fcc Ru to bind directly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as TaN and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition technique, we find that the vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru can be up to eight times lower than that calculated for conventional liners used for Cu interconnects. Our calculations, therefore, suggest that the formation of the fcc phase of Ru may be a beneficial for advanced, low-resistance interconnects."

We report the discovery of a NSC in the dwarf galaxy KKs58 and investigate its properties together with those of another NSC in KK197. Both NSCs are hosted by dwarf elliptical galaxies of the Centaurus group. Combining ESO VLT MUSE data with photometry from VLT FORS2, CTIO Blanco DECam, and HST ACS, as well as high-resolution spectroscopy from VLT UVES, we analyse the photometric, kinematic and stellar population properties of the NSCs and their host galaxies. We confirm membership of the NSCs based on their radial velocities and location close to the galaxy centres. We also confirm the membership of two globular clusters (GCs) and detect oblate rotation in the main body of KK197. Based on high signal-to-noise spectra taken with MUSE of the NSCs of both KKs58 and KK197 we measure low metallicities, [Fe/H] = $-1.75 \pm 0.06$ dex and [Fe/H] = $-1.84 \pm 0.05$ dex, and stellar masses of $7.3 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $1.0 \times 10^6 M_\odot$, respectively. Both NSCs are more metal-poor than their hosts that have metallicities of $-1.35 \pm 0.23$ dex (KKs58) and $-0.84 \pm 0.12$ dex (KK197). This can be interpreted as NSC formation via the in-spiral of GCs. The masses, sizes and metallicities of the two NSCs place them among other NSCs, but also among the known UCDs of the Centaurus group. This indicates that NSCs might constitute the progenitors of a part of the low-mass UCDs, although their properties are almost indistinguishable from typical GCs."

We show that such model allows two types of solutions: topologically trivial (gaussons) and topologically non-trivial (kinks), depending on a sign of the nonlinear coupling. We focus primarily on the kinks' case and study their scattering properties. For the kink-antikink scattering, we have found a critical value of the initial velocity, which separates two different scenarios of scattering. For the initial velocities below this critical value, the kinks form a bound state, which then decays slowly. If the initial velocities are above the critical value, the kinks collide, bounce and eventually escape to infinities. During this process, the higher initial velocity is, the greater is the elasticity of the collision. We also study excitation spectrum of the kink solution."

Hence living systems exert active stresses on the complex environments in which they reside. One recurring aspect of this complexity is the viscoelasticity of the medium surrounding living systems: bacteria secrete their own viscoelastic extracellular matrix, and cells constantly deform, proliferate, and self-propel within viscoelastic networks of collagen. It is therefore imperative to understand how active matter modifies, and gets modified by, viscoelastic fluids. Here, we present a two-phase model of active nematic matter that dynamically interacts with a passive viscoelastic polymeric phase and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to illustrate its applicability. Motivated by recent experiments we first study the suppression of cell division by a viscoelastic medium surrounding the cell. We further show that the self-propulsion of a model keratocyte cell is modified by the polymer relaxation of the surrounding viscoelastic fluid in a non-uniform manner and find that increasing polymer viscosity effectively suppresses the cell motility. Lastly, we explore the hampering impact of the viscoelastic medium on the generic hydrodynamic instabilities of active nematics by simulating the dynamics of an active stripe within a polymeric fluid. The model presented here can provide a framework for investigating more complex dynamics such as the interaction of multicellular growing systems with viscoelastic environments."

The Dalton Minimum is often considered one of the grand minima captured in the coverage of telescopic observations. Nevertheless, the reconstructions of the sunspot group number vary significantly, and the existing butterfly diagrams have a large data gap during the period. This is partially because most long-term observations have remained unexplored in historical archives. Therefore, to improve our understanding on the Dalton Minimum, we have located two series of Thadd\""aus Derfflinger's observational records (a summary manuscript and logbooks) as well as his Brander's 5.5-feet azimuthal-quadrant preserved in the Kremsm\""unster Observatory. We have revised the existing Derfflinger's sunspot group number with Waldmeier classification and eliminated all the existing 'spotless days' to remove contaminations from solar meridian observations. We have reconstructed the butterfly diagram on the basis of his observations and illustrated sunspot distributions in both solar hemispheres. Our article aims to revise the trend of Derfflinger's sunspot group number and to bridge a data gap of the existing butterfly diagrams around the Dalton Minimum. Our results confirm that the Dalton Minimum is significantly different from the Maunder Minimum, both in terms of cycle amplitudes and sunspot distributions. Therefore, the Dalton Minimum is more likely a secular minimum in the long-term solar activity, while further investigations for the observations at that time are required."

The switching effect is shown to be due to the semiconductor-to-metal phase transition (SMPT) in vanadium dioxide. The shift of the switching threshold voltage, accompanied by the memory effect, in forward bias of the p-Si-VO2 anisotype heterojunction is observed. To explain this effect, a model is proposed which suggests the existence of an additional series resistance associated with a channel at the VO2/Si interface, where a SiOx layer forms during the VO2 deposition process. This resistance is responsible for both threshold switching characteristics, and the memory effect, and the oxygen ion electromigration process is shown to underlie this effect.

They acquire a corona reflecting the PS-nanomaterials interaction. Since the corona determines directly the NPs biological fate, the question of its nature and structure is central. Here, we report on the corona architecture raising after incubation of positive or negative silica particles with Curosurf, a biomimetic pulmonary surfactant of porcine origin. Using optical, electron and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), we determine the pulmonary surfactant corona structure at different scales of observation. Contrary to common belief, the PS corona is not only constituted by phospholipidic bilayers surrounding NPs but by multiple hybrid structures derived from NPs-vesicles interaction. Statistical analysis of cryo-TEM images provides interesting highlights about the nature of the corona depending on the particle charge. The influence of Curosurf pre- or post-treatment is also investigated and demonstrate the need of protocols standardization."

Transformer ratio, as the ratio of the maximum accelerating field to the maximum decelerating field inside the bunch, and accelerating the wakefield have been investigated taking into account nonlinearity of the wakefield. The dependence of the transformer ratio and the maximum accelerating field on the length of the bunch was investigated with a constant charge of the bunch. It was taken into account that the length of the nonlinear wakefield increases with increasing length of the bunch. It is shown that the transformer ratio reaches its maximum value for a certain length of the bunch. The maximum value of the transformer ratio reaches six as due to the profiling of the bunch, and due to the non-linearity of the wakefield."

The QUBO formulation is derived using the Legendre transformation and the Wolfe theorem, which have recently been employed to derive the QUBO formulations of ReLU-type functions.

The isolated CrI3 nanoplatelets have lateral dimensions of ~25 nm and ensemble thicknesses of only ~4 nm, corresponding to just a few CrI3 monolayers. Magnetic and magneto-optical measurements demonstrate robust 2D ferromagnetic ordering in these nanoplatelets with Curie temperatures similar to those observed in bulk CrI3, despite the strong spatial confinement. These data also show magnetization steps akin to those observed in micron-sized few-layer 2D sheets and associated with concerted spin-reversal of individual CrI3 layers within few-layer van der Waals stacks. Similar data have also been obtained for CrBr3 and anion-alloyed Cr(I1-xBrx)3 nanoplatelets. These results represent the first example of laterally confined 2D van der Waals ferromagnets of any composition. The demonstration of robust ferromagnetism at nanometer lateral dimensions opens new doors for miniaturization in spintronics devices based on van der Waals ferromagnets."

Here we propose a macroscopical control of the backscattering direction by optimizing the cavity size. The signature of positive and negative backscattering directions in each single microdisk is confirmed with two strongly coupled microdisks. Furthermore, the diabolical points are achieved at the resonance of two microdisks, which agrees well with the theoretical calculations considering backscattering directions. The diabolical points in active optical structures pave a way to implement quantum information processing with geometric phase in quantum photonic networks."

The well-known phenomenon of the ""curse of dimensionality"" states: many problems become exponentially difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the ""blessing of dimensionality"", has attracted much attention. It turns out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces.

To deal with the automatic generation of custom-made configurations of web applications, industry usually adopts annotation-based approaches despite the majority of studies encourage the use of composition-based approaches to implement Software Product Lines. Recent work tries to combine both approaches to get the complementary benefits. However, technological companies are reticent to adopt new development paradigms such as feature-oriented programming or aspect-oriented programming. Moreover, it is extremely difficult, or even impossible, to apply these programming models to web applications, mainly because of their multilingual nature, since their development involves multiple types of source code (Java, Groovy, JavaScript), templates (HTML, Markdown, XML), style sheet files (CSS and its variants, such as SCSS), and other files (JSON, YML, shell scripts). We propose to use the Common Variability Language as a composition-based approach and integrate annotations to manage fine grained variability of a Software Product Line for web applications. In this paper, we (i) show that existing composition and annotation-based approaches, including some well-known combinations, are not appropriate to model and implement the variability of web applications; and (ii) present a combined approach that effectively integrates annotations into a composition-based approach for web applications. We implement our approach and show its applicability with an industrial real-world system."

Recent empirical studies generally suggest that filter bubbles may principally be observed in the case of explicit recommendation (based on user-declared preferences) rather than implicit recommendation (based on user activity). We focus on YouTube which has become a major online content provider but where confinement has until now been little-studied in a systematic manner. Starting from a diverse number of seed videos, we first describe the properties of the sets of suggested videos in order to design a sound exploration protocol able to capture latent recommendation graphs recursively induced by these suggestions. These graphs form the background of potential user navigations along non-personalized recommendations. From there, be it in topological, topical or temporal terms, we show that the landscape of what we call mean-field YouTube recommendations is often prone to confinement dynamics. Moreover, the most confined recommendation graphs i.e., potential bubbles, seem to be organized around sets of videos that garner the highest audience and thus plausibly viewing time."

We present Scout, a system that helps designers rapidly explore alternatives through mixed-initiative interaction with high-level constraints and design feedback. Prior constraint-based layout systems use low-level spatial constraints and generally produce a single design. Tosupport designer exploration of alternatives, Scout introduces high-level constraints based on design concepts (e.g.,~semantic structure, emphasis, order) and formalizes them into low-level spatial constraints that a solver uses to generate potential layouts. In an evaluation with 18 interface designers, we found that Scout: (1) helps designers create more spatially diverse layouts with similar quality to those created with a baseline tool and (2) can help designers avoid a linear design process and quickly ideate layouts they do not believe they would have thought of on their own."

Recent theoretical predictions suggest a new class of materials, termed hyperferroelectics, that should be robust against the depolarization field and enable ferroelectricity down to the monolayer limit. Here we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of hexagonal LiZnSb, one of the hyperferroelectric candidate materials, by molecular-beam epitaxy on GaSb (111)B substrates. Due to the high volatility of all three atomic species, we find that LiZnSb can be grown in an adsorption-controlled window, using an excess zinc flux. Within this window, the desired polar hexagonal phase is stabilized with respect to a competing cubic polymorph, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements. First-principles calculations show that for moderate amounts of epitaxial strain and moderate concentrations of Li vacancies, the cubic LiZnSb phase is lower in formation energy than the hexagonal phase, but only by a few meV per formula unit. Therefore we suggest that kinetics plays a role in stabilizing the desired hexagonal phase at low temperatures. Our results provide a path towards experimentally demonstrating ferroelectricity and hyperferroelectricity in a new class of ternary intermetallic compounds."

With the rise of more sensitive observations, the number of pulsar-SNR and PWN associations (hereafter, SNR/PWN) has increased, yet we do not understand to which extent this environment influences the pulsars' impulsive radio signals. We studied the dispersive contribution of SNRs and PWNe on Galactic pulsars, and considered their relevance to fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 121102. We investigated the dispersion measure (DM) contribution of SNRs and PWNe by comparing the measured DMs of Galactic pulsars in a SNR/PWN to the DM expected only from the intervening interstellar electrons, using the NE2001 model. We find that a two-$\sigma$ DM contribution of SNRs and PWNe to the pulsar signal exists, amounting to $21.1 \pm 10.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The control sample of pulsars unassociated with a SNR/PWN shows no excess. We model the SNR and PWN electron densities for each young pulsar in our sample and show that these indeed predict an excess of this magnitude. By extrapolating to the kind of fast-spinning, high magnetic field, young pulsars that may power FRBs, we show their SNR and PWN are capable of significantly contributing to the observed DM."

Hence, the purpose of this study is to increase the accuracy of coronary heart disease diagnosis through selecting significant predictive features in order of their ranking. In this study, we propose an integrated method using machine learning. The machine learning methods of random trees (RTs), decision tree of C5.0, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree of Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) are used in this study.

We describe the measurements between redshifts $z=0$ to $z=4$ on both linear and non-linear scales. The best-fits of the gravitational quasi-equilibrium distribution (GQED), the negative binomial distribution (NBD), the Poisson-Lognormal distribution (PLN), and the Poisson-Lognormal distribution with a bias parameter (PLNB) are compared to simulations. The fits agree reasonably consistently over a range of redshifts and scales. To distinguish quintessence (RPCDM) and phantom ($w$CDM) dark energy from $\Lambda$ dark energy, we present a new method that compares the model parameters of the counts-in-cells probability distribution functions. We find that the mean and variance of the halo counts-in-cells on $2-25h^{-1}$Mpc scales between redshifts $0.65<z<4$ show significant percentage differences for different dark energy cosmologies. On $15-25h^{-1}$Mpc scales, the $g$ parameter in NBD, $\omega$ parameter in PLN, $b$ and $C_b$ parameters in PLNB show larger percentage differences for different dark energy cosmologies than on smaller scales. On $2-6h^{-1}$Mpc scales, kurtosis and the $b$ parameter in the GQED show larger percentage differences for different dark energy cosmologies than on larger scales. For cosmologies explored in the DEUS simulations, the percentage differences between these statistics for the RPCDM and $w$CDM dark energy cosmologies relative to $\Lambda$CDM generally increases with redshift from a few percent to significantly larger percentages at $z=4$. Applying our method to simulations and galaxy surveys can provide a useful way to distinguish among dark energy models and cosmologies in general."

Such unified scene exploration under orthogonality allows for multitudes of applications such as semantic plane detection or local and global scan alignment, which in turn can aid robot localization or grasping tasks. Our two-stage pipeline involves a rough yet joint estimation of orthogonal planes followed by a subsequent joint refinement of plane parameters respecting their orthogonality relations. We form a graph of these primitives, paving the way to the extraction of further reliable features: lines and corners. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach in numerous scenarios from wall detection to 6D tracking, both on synthetic and real data."

We quantify their respective effects on the position of stars in the chromosome map, especially among the first population. We computed atmosphere models and synthetic spectra for stars of different chemical compositions, based on isochrones produced by stellar evolution calculations with abundance variations representative of first and second populations in GCs. From this we built synthetic chromosome maps for a mixture of stars of different chemical compositions. We subsequently replaced a fraction of stars with binaries, or stars with chromospheric emission, using synthetic spectroscopy. We studied how the position of stars is affected in the chromosome map. Binaries can, in principle, explain the extension of the first population in the chromosome map. However, we find that given the binary fraction reported for GCs, the density of stars in the extended part is too small. Another difficulty of the binary explanation is that the shape of the distribution of the first population in the chromosome map is different in clusters with similar binary fractions. Additionally, we find that the contribution of chromospheric emission lines to the HST photometry is too small to have an observable impact on the shape of the chromosome map. Continuum chromospheric emission has an effect qualitatively similar to binaries. We conclude that binaries do have an impact on the morphology of the chromosome map of GCs, but they are unlikely to explain entirely the shape of the extended distribution of the first population stars. Uncertainties in the properties of continuum chromospheric emission of stars in GCs prevent any quantitative conclusion. Therefore, the origin of the extended first population remains unexplained."

However, different type of barriers existed that could affect collaboration in todays work environment, in which different generations are involved. Although researchers have identified several technical barriers to intergenerational collaboration (iGOAL), the influence of cultural diversity on iGOAL has rarely been studied. Therefore, using a quantitative study approach, this paper investigates the impact of differences in cultural background on perceived technical and operational barriers to iGOAL. Our study reveals six barriers to IGC that are perceived differently by culturally diverse people (CDP) and non-CDP. Furthermore, CDP can foster IGC because CDP consider the barriers to be of less of a reason to avoid working with different generations than do non-CDP."

We use the spectra of more than 30,000 red giant branch (RGB) stars in 25 globular clusters (GC), obtained within the MUSE survey of Galactic globular clusters, to calibrate the Ca II triplet (CaT) metallicity relation and derive metallicities for all individual stars. We investigate the overall metallicity distributions as well as those of the different populations within each cluster.   Methods. The Ca II triplet in the near-infrared at 8498, 8542, and 8662 AA is visible in stars with spectral types between F and M and can be used to determine their metallicities. In this work, we calibrate the relation using average cluster metallicities from literature and MUSE spectra, and extend it below the horizontal branch - a cutoff that has traditionally been made to avoid a non-linear relation - using a quadratic function. In addition to the classic relation based on V-VHB we also present calibrations based on absolute magnitude and luminosity. The obtained relations are then used to calculate metallicities for all the stars in the sample and to derive metallicity distributions for different populations within a cluster, which have been separated using so-called ""chromosome maps"" based on HST photometry.   Results. We show that, despite the relatively low spectral resolution of MUSE (R=1900-3700) we can derive single star metallicities with a mean statistical intra-cluster uncertainty of ~0.12 dex. We present metallicity distributions for the RGB stars in 25 GCs, and investigate the different metallicities of the populations P3 (and higher) in so-called metal-complex or Type II clusters, finding metallicity variations in all of them. We also detected unexpected metallicity variations in the Type I cluster NGC 2808 and confirm the Type II status of NGC 7078."

Still, the physical relation between local gas clouds has remained practically unknown because the distance accuracy to clouds is of the same order or larger than their sizes. With the advent of large photometric surveys and the Gaia satellite astrometric survey this situation has changed. Here we report the 3-D structure of all local cloud complexes. We find a narrow and coherent 2.7 kpc arrangement of dense gas in the Solar neighborhood that contains many of the clouds thought to be associated with the Gould Belt. This finding is inconsistent with the notion that these clouds are part of a ring, disputing the Gould Belt model. The new structure comprises the majority of nearby star-forming regions, has an aspect ratio of about 1:20, and contains about 3 million solar masses of gas. Remarkably, the new structure appears to be undulating and its 3-D distribution is well described by a damped sinusoidal wave on the plane of the Milky Way, with an average period of about 2 kpc and a maximum amplitude of about 160 pc. Our results represent a first step in the revision of the local gas distribution and Galactic structure and offer a new, broader context to studies on the transformation of molecular gas into stars."

From the comparison with the results of $\mathrm{BaFe_{2}}(\mathrm{As}_{1-x}\mathrm{P}_{x}\mathrm{)_{2}}$, the effects of smaller structural anisotropy ($c/a$) on the Fermi surfaces (FSs) and the gap structures are discussed. The observed FSs have three dimensional shapes. One of the hole FSs is strongly warped between the $\Gamma$ and $Z$ points, and the innermost FS observed at the $Z$ point disappears at the $\Gamma$ point, which is similar to the FS features of $\mathrm{SrFe_{2}}(\mathrm{As}_{1-x}\mathrm{P}_{x}\mathrm{)_{2}}$ ($x$ = 0.35). In the superconducting state, the node like gap-minimum is present for the $d_{xy}$ electron FS near the $X$ point, while the gaps around the other high symmetry points are isotropic.

Methods.--Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The basic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China, and falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0]."

We show that the distribution of these observables can be characterized by a single parameter, that is connected to a local property of the probability density function (PDF) of the process, viz., the probability of occupying the origin at time $t$, $P(t)$. We test our results for two different models of lattice random walks with spatially inhomogeneous transition probabilities, one of which of non-Markovian nature, and find good agreement with theory. We also show that the distributions depend only on the occupation probability of the origin by comparing them for the two systems: when $P(t)$ show the same long-time behavior, each observable follows indeed the same distribution."

The current neutrino constraints from cosmology should be therefore regarded as robust, as they are not strongly dependent on the dark sector physics, once all the available observations are combined. Namely, we find a total neutrino mass $M_\nu<0.15$ eV and a number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom of $N_{\rm eff}=3.03^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$, both at 95\% CL, which are close to those obtained within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, $M_\nu<0.12$ eV and $N_{\rm eff}=3.00^{+0.36}_{-0.35}$ for the same data combination."

We reveal, for the first time, pulsations of the pulsar X-ray emission with a single sinusoidal pulse-profile and a pulsed fraction of $23 \, \pm \, 6$ per cent in the 0.3--2 keV band. We confirm previous Chandra findings that the pulsar X-ray spectrum consists of thermal and non-thermal components. However, we do not find the absorption feature that was previously detected at about 0.8 keV. Thanks to the greater sensitivity of XMM-Newton, we get stronger constraints on spectral model parameters compared to previous studies. The thermal component can be equally well described by either blackbody or neutron star atmosphere models, implying that this emission is coming from either hot pulsar polar caps with a temperature of about 120 eV or from the colder bulk of the neutron star surface with a temperature of about 50 eV. In the latter case, the pulsar appears to be one of the coolest among other neutron stars of similar ages with estimated surface temperatures. We discuss cooling scenarios relevant to this neutron star. Using an interstellar absorption--distance relation, we also constrain the distance to the pulsar to the range of 0.7--2 kpc. Besides the pulsar and its compact nebula, we detect regions of weak large-scale diffuse non-thermal emission in the pulsar field and discuss their possible nature."

Analysing the nuclear surface brightness profiles of 12 newly imaged slow rotators, we classify their light profiles as core-less, and place an upper limit to the core size of ~10 pc. Considering the full magnitude and volume-limited ATLAS3D sample, we correlate the presence or lack of cores with stellar kinematics, including the proxy for the stellar angular momentum and the velocity dispersion within one half-light radius, stellar mass, stellar age, $\alpha$-element abundance, and age and metallicity gradients. More than half of the slow rotators have core-less light profiles, and they are all less massive than $10^{11}$ Msun. Core-less slow rotators show evidence for counter-rotating flattened structures, have steeper metallicity gradients, and a larger dispersion of gradient values than core slow rotators. Our results suggest that core and core-less slow rotators have different assembly processes, where the former are the relics of massive dissipation-less merging in the presence of central supermassive black holes. Formation processes of core-less slow rotators are consistent with accretion of counter-rotating gas or gas-rich mergers of special orbital configurations, which lower the final net angular momentum of stars, but support star formation. We also highlight core fast rotators as galaxies that share properties of core slow rotators and core-less slow rotators. Formation processes similar to those for core-less slow rotators can be invoked to explain the assembly of core fast rotators, with the distinction that these processes form or preserve cores.[Abridged]"

Based on observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and the NOEMA Interferometer, the 11-10 transition of molecular oxygen is the likely origin of line with rest frequency close to 118.75 GHz. The velocity of the O2 emission in Mrk 231 coincides with the red wing seen in CO emission, suggesting that it is associated with the outflowing molecular gas, located mainly at about ten kpc away from the central AGN. This first detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen provides an ideal tool to study AGN-driven molecular outflows on dynamic time scales of tens of Myr. O2 may be a significant coolant for molecular gas in such regions affected by AGN-driven outflows. New astrochemical models are needed to explain the implied high molecular oxygen abundance in such regions several kpc away from the center of galaxies."

We also discuss the relation between the equations of motion, the (non-)invariance of the Lagrangian and the (non-)conservation of the supercurrents in the two models. We exhibit a similarity transformation that maps the free-field supersymmetric PT-symmetric Dirac model to a supersymmetric Hermitian theory, but there is in general no corresponding similarity transformation for the Majorana model.

An innovative technique based on the expansion parallax method, the so-called distance mapping technique (DMT), provides distance maps of expanding nebulae as well as an estimation of their distances. The DMT combines the tangential velocity vectors obtained from 3D morpho-kinematic models and the observed proper motion vectors to estimate the distance. We applied the DMT to four PNe (NGC 6702, NGC 6543, NGC 6302, and BD+30 3639) and one nova remnant (GK Persei) and derived new distances in good agreement with previous studies. New simple morpho-kinematic shape models were generated for NGC 6543, NGC 6302, and NGC 6702, whereas for BD+30 3639 and GK Persei published models were used. We demonstrate that the DMT is a useful tool to obtain distance values of PNe, in addition to revealing kinematically peculiar regions within the nebulae. Distances are also derived from the trigonometric Gaia parallaxes. The effect of the non-negligible parallax offset in the second Gaia data release is also discussed."

This paper aims to formulate the research framework for prediction of antecedents of smart mobility by using SEM-Neural hybrid approach towards preliminary data analysis. This research undertook smart mobility services adoption in Malaysia as study perspective and applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as theoretical basis. An extended TAM model was hypothesized with five external factors (digital dexterity, IoT service quality, intrusiveness concerns, social electronic word of mouth and subjective norm). The data was collected through a pilot survey in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Then responses were analyzed for reliability, validity and accuracy of model. Finally, the causal relationship was explained by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networking (ANN). The paper will share better understanding of road technology acceptance to all stakeholders to refine, revise and update their policies.

We report the static properties of bimerons with different topological structures in a frustrated ferromagnetic monolayer, where the bimeron structure is characterized by the vorticity $Q_{\text{v}}$ and helicity $\eta$. It is found that the bimeron energy increases with $Q_{\text{v}}$, and the energy of an isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ depends on $\eta$. We also report the dynamics of frustrated bimerons driven by the spin-orbit torques, which depend on the strength of the dampinglike and fieldlike torques. We find that the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ can be driven into linear or elliptical motion when the spin polarization is perpendicular to the easy axis. We numerically reveal the damping dependence of the bimeron Hall angle driven by the dampinglike torque. Besides, the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ can be driven into rotation by the dampinglike torque when the spin polarization is parallel to the easy axis. The rotation frequency is proportional to the driving current density. In addition, we numerically demonstrate the possibility of creating a bimeron state with a higher or lower topological charge by the current-driven collision and merging of bimeron states with different $Q_{\text{v}}$. Our results could be useful for understanding the bimeron physics in frustrated magnets."

It is known that the accuracy of 3D-PTV depends on the mapping function to reconstruct three-dimensional particles locations. The mapping function becomes more complicated if the number of cameras is increased and there is a liquid-vapor interface, which crucially affect the total computation time. In this paper, using a shallow neural network model (SNN), we dramatically decrease the computation time with a high accuracy to successfully reconstruct the three-dimensional particle positions, which can be used for real-time particle detection for 3D-PTV. The developed technique is verified by numerical simulations and applied to measure a complex solutal Marangoni flow patterns inside a binary mixture droplet."

The method will be applied to study thermal properties of cometary dust particles. Methods: The recently introduced incoherent Monte Carlo radiative transfer method developed for scattering, absorption, and propagation of electromagnetic waves in dense discrete random media is extended for radiative heat transfer and thermal emission. The solution is coupled with the conductive Fourier transport equation that is solved with the finite-element method. Results: The proposed method allows the synoptic analysis of light scattering and thermal emission by large cometary dust particles consisting of submicrometer-sized grains.

We show that, if the Higgs particle has a fully gravitational content via the equivalence principle, enhanced cross-sections of black holes at colliders should be expected within the Standard Model itself. The case of black hole production by precision measurements at electron colliders is discussed. The Coulomb repulsion strongly suppresses the related cross-section with respect to the one based on the hoop conjecture, making the possible production of black holes still unfeasible with current beam technology. At the same time, this suggests the reanalysis of the bounds, based on the hoop conjecture, already determined in hadronic collisions for extra-dimensional models."

In Industry 4.0 (or Industrial IoT) applications, interconnected sensors provide a means of data acquisition for automated control of the manufacturing process. Ensuring a continuous energy supply to the sensors is essential for their reliable operation. Manufacturing machines usually display a wide spectrum of vibration frequencies which needs to be covered by an array of harvester substructures in order to maintain the desired output level. We show that mechanical structures designed to implement a Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator have an increased bandwidth by exploiting several orders of parametric resonances. In contrast to concepts implementing parametric amplification in a multi-mode scenario, our concept is based on a single mechanical mode. Therefore, it is more robust against fabrication tolerances as the relevant multi-mode resonance conditions do not need to be matched on the level of single chips. Using exact transient simulations and semi-analytic models to showcase the relation of the Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator to the damped and driven Mathieu equation, we show that parametric resonances highly increase the bandwidth of the output power whenever high Helmholtz nonlinearities are present. To achieve the required nonlinearities, we suggest nonlinear stress-strain curves and we propose to achieve such nonlinearities through field-induced striction by magneto- or electrostriction. Thus, we are able to propose a novel energy harvester concept incorporating strictive materials that exploits the effects of parametric excitation to achieve broadband vibrational energy harvesting."

The star formation histories of these hosts are diverse, including one post-starburst galaxy (ASASSN-14li), two hosts with recent weak starbursts (ASASSN-14ae and iPTF15af), and one early type (PTF09ge). Compared to early type galaxies of similar stellar masses, the TDE hosts have higher central surface brightnesses and stellar mass surface densities on 30-100 pc scales. The TDE hosts do not show the large, kpc-scale tidal disruptions seen in some post-starburst galaxies; the hosts have low morphological asymmetries similar to those of early type galaxies. The lack of strong asymmetries are inconsistent with a recent major (~1:1 mass) merger, although minor ($\lesssim$1:3) mergers are possible. Given the time elapsed since the end of the starbursts in the three post-burst TDE hosts and the constraints on the merger mass ratios, it is unlikely that a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) has had time to coalesce. The TDE hosts have low central (<140 pc) ellipticities compared to early type galaxies. The low central ellipticities disfavor a strong radial anisotropy as the cause for the enhanced TDE rate, although we cannot rule out eccentric disks at the scale of the black hole gravitational radius of influence (~1 pc). These observations suggest that the high central stellar densities are a more important driver than SMBHBs or radial anisotropies in increasing the TDE rate in galaxies with recent starbursts."

Our method identifies communities of particles that share a similar local structure by harvesting the information hidden in the spatial variation of two- or three-body static correlations. This corresponds to an unsupervised machine learning approach that infers communities solely from the particle positions and their species. We apply this method to three models of supercooled liquids and find that it detects subtle forms of local order, as demonstrated by a comparison with the statistics of Voronoi cells. Finally, we analyze the time-dependent correlation between structural communities and particle mobility and show that our method captures relevant information about glassy dynamics."

Since TMMs have the double-layered Kagome lattice structures for their $\pi$-electrons, i.e., tiling of trigonal and hexagonal-symmetric rings, the electronic band structures of TMMs have non-equivalent Dirac cones and perfect flat bands. By constructing the tight-binding model to describe the pi-electronic states of TMMs, we have evaluated the optical absorption intensities and valley selective excitation of TMMs based on the Kubo formula. It is found that absorption intensities crucially depend on both light polarization angle and the excitation position in momentum space, i.e., the momentum and valley selective optical excitation. The polarization dependence and optical selection rules are also clarified by using group theoretical analyses."

Here, we provide an interpretation of the recombination mechanisms of these quantum emitters through polarization-resolved and magneto-optical spectroscopy at low temperature. Three types of defect-related quantum emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) are observed, with different exciton g factors of 2.02, 9.36 and unobservable Zeeman shift, respectively. The various magnetic response of the spatially localized excitons strongly indicate that the radiative recombination stems from the different transitions between defect-induced energy levels, valance and conduction bands. Furthermore, the different g factors and zero-field splittings of the three types of emitters strongly show that quantum dots embedded in monolayer have various types of confining potentials for localized excitons, resulting in electron-hole exchange interaction with a range of values in the presence of anisotropy. Our work further sheds light on the recombination mechanisms of defect-related quantum emitters and paves a way toward understanding the role of defects in single photon emitters in atomically thin semiconductors."

The timescales over which amorphous water ice is thermally transformed to crystalline water ice at Europan surface temperatures suggests that the water ice there should be primarily in the crystalline form, however, surface bombardment by charged particles induced by Jupiter's magnetic field, and vapor deposition of water ice from Europan plumes, can produce amorphous water ice surface deposits on short timescales. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the Europan surface water ice crystallinity derived from ground-based spectroscopic measurements is in agreement with the crystallinity expected based on temperature and radiation modeling. Using a 1D thermophysical model of Europa's surface, we calculate a full-disk crystallinity of Europa's leading hemisphere by incorporating the thermal relaxation of amorphous to crystalline water ice and the degradation of crystalline to amorphous water ice by irradiation. Concurrently, we derive the full-disk crystallinity of Europa's leading hemisphere using a comparison of near-infrared ground-based spectral observations from Grundy et al. (1999), Busarev et al. (2018), and the Apache Point Observatory with laboratory spectra from Mastrapa et al. (2018) and the Ice Spectroscopy Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We calculate a modeled crystallinity significantly higher than crystallinities derived from ground-based observations and laboratory spectra. This discrepancy may be a result of geophysical processes, such as by vapor-deposited plume material, or it may arise from assumptions and uncertainties in the crystallinity calculations."

We compare the migration behavior of two mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines and one epithelial cell line, and find that the epithelial cells are able to migrate through the narrowest microconstrictions as the more invasive mesenchymal cells. In addition, we demonstrate that migration of epithelial cells through a highly compressive environment can occur in absence of a chemoattractive stimulus, thus evidencing that they are just as prone to react to mechanical cues as invasive cells."

The purpose of this work was the study of the viability of the introduction of new non food crops in marginal areas of real farms. This study compares the profit margin and the energy and environmental performance of growing tall wheatgrass, in the marginal area of a rainfed farm versus rye, the annual crop sowed traditionally in the marginal area of the farm. The cited farm owned 300 ha of which about 13 percent was marginal. The methodology was based on the use of the profit margin of the crops as indicator for the economic assessment and Life Cycle Assessment LCA as technique for the energy and the environmental evaluations. Results of the economic analysis showed a slight enhancement of the profit margin for tall wheatgrass 156 Euro ha-1 y-1 compared to rye 145 Euro ha-1 y-1. Environmental LCA was driven by CO2 fixation due to soil organic matter increase and reduced inputs consumption for tall wheatgrass that produced a Global Warming Potential GWP of -1.9 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 versus 1.6 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 obtained for rye. Tall wheatgrass cultivation primary energy consumption was less than 40 percent of rye s consumption. According to the results achieved it was concluded that tall wheatgrass is better option than rye from the energy and the environmental point of views and slight better option from the economic view. Considering these results, monetarization of the CO2 eq reductions of tall wheatgrass compared to rye is essential to improve its profit margin and promote the implantation of this new crop in marginal areas of farms."

The new model, called Dusty SAGE, follows the condensation of dust in the ejecta of type II supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, grain growth in the dense molecular clouds, destruction by supernovae shocks, and the removal of dust from the ISM by star formation, reheating, inflows and outflows. Our model successfully reproduces the observed dust mass function at redshift z = 0 and the observed scaling relations for dust across a wide range of redshifts. We find that the dust mass content in the present Universe is mainly produced via grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). By contrast, in the early Universe, the primary production mechanism for dust is the condensation in stellar ejecta. The shift of the significant production channel for dust characterises the scaling relations of dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metal (DTM) ratios. In galaxies where the grain growth dominates, we find positive correlations for DTG and DTM ratios with both metallicity and stellar mass. On the other hand, in galaxies where dust is produced primarily via condensation, we find negative or no correlation for DTM and DTG ratios with either metallicity or stellar mass. In agreement with observation showing that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more dust than the ISM, our model also shows the same trend for z < 4.

This paper develops an orbit-averaged formalism to characterize the cluster's mean-field effects as well as the physics of long-period stellar encounters. Our secular approach allows for an analytic description of the dynamical consequences of the cluster environment on its constituent planetary systems. We analyze special cases of the resulting Hamiltonian, corresponding to eccentricity evolution driven by planar encounters, as well as hyperbolic perturbations upon dissipative disks. We subsequently apply our results to the early evolution of our solar system, where the cluster's collective potential perturbs the solar system's plane, and stellar encounters act to increase the velocity dispersion of the Kuiper belt. Our results are two-fold: first, we find that cluster effects can alter the mean plane of the solar system by $\lesssim1\deg$, and are thus insufficient to explain the $\psi\approx6\deg$ obliquity of the sun. Second, we delineate the extent to which stellar flybys excite the orbital dispersion of the cold classical Kuiper belt, and show that while stellar flybys may grow the cold belt's inclination by the observed amount, the resulting distribution is incompatible with the data. Correspondingly, our calculations place an upper limit on the product of the stellar number density and residence time of the sun in its birth cluster, $\eta\,\tau\lesssim2\times10^4\,$Myr/pc$^3$."

This inversion approach is then applied to data from the MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)) instrument and the HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)) instrument. In the end, rotation rate profiles estimated from eigenfunction perturbation and frequency splittings are compared.   The rotation rate profiles from the two different approaches are qualitatively in good agreement, especially for the MDI data. Significant differences are obtained at high latitudes $> 50^{\circ}$ and near the subsurface. The result from HMI data shows larger discrepancies between the different methods. We find that the two global helioseismic approaches provide complementary methods for measuring solar rotation. Comparing the results from different methods may help to reveal systematic influences that affect analyses based on eigenfunction perturbations, like meridional flow measurements."

A consequence of this symmetry is the possible existence of superconducting domains of opposite chirality. At the boundary of such domains, the locally supressed condensate can produce an intrinsic Josephson junction. Here, we provide evidence of such junctions using mesoscopic rings, structured from Sr$_\mathsf{2}$RuO$_\mathsf{4}$ single crystals. Our order parameter simulations predict such rings to host stable domain walls across their arms. Thisis verified with transport experiments on loops, with a sharp transition at 1.5 K, which show distinct critical current oscillations with periodicity corresponding to the flux quantum. In contrast, loops with broadened transitions at around 3 K are void of such junctions and show standard Little-Parks oscillations. Our analysis demonstrates the junctions are of intrinsic origin and makes a compelling case for the existence of superconducting domains."

This toolbox consists of a collection of algorithms commonly used for generating patterns for these devices with a focus on optical tweezers beam shaping applications. In addition to the algorithms provided, we have put together a range of user interfaces for simplifying the use of these patterns. The toolbox currently has functionality to generate patterns which can be saved as a image or displayed on a device/screen using the supplied interface. We have only implemented interfaces for the devices our group currently uses but we believe that extending the code we provide to other devices should be fairly straightforward. The range of algorithms included in the toolbox is not exhaustive. However, by making the toolbox open sources and available on GitHub we hope that other researchers working with these devices will contribute their patterns/algorithms to the toolbox."

Annealing of the system shows a second-order transition from paramagnetic to charge-ordered phase for zero as well as small disorders. We have also calculated the critical exponents and transition temperature using a finite sizing scaling approach. The Monte Carlo simulation is done using the Metropolis algorithm, which allowed us to study larger lattice sizes. The transition temperature and the critical exponents at zero disorder matched the previous studies within numerical error. We found that the transition temperature of the system decreased as the disorder is increased. The values of critical exponents $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ were less and value of $\nu$ more than the corresponding zero disorder values. The use of large system sizes led to the correct variation of critical exponents with the disorder."

However, the annotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large datasets. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an example of systems that exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor readings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The size of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a human annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the dataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting supervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is negatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate three different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps are taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single ""Unknown"" or ""Do-Nothing"" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of the second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one of them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels. Also, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by constructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further performance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and their hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing more than $2.5\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more than nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast under the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling approach for better performance."

Yet, the role of this instability in the driving of turbulence in protoplanetary disks, given its fundamental nature as a linear hydrodynamical instability, has so far not been investigated in detail. We study the turbulence that is induced by the streaming instability as well as its interaction with the vertical shear instability. For this purpose, we employ the FLASH Code to conduct two-dimensional axisymmetric global disk simulations spanning radii from $1$ au to $100$ au, including the mutual drag between gas and dust as well as the radial and vertical stellar gravity. If the streaming instability and the vertical shear instability start their growth at the same time, we find the turbulence in the dust mid-plane layer to be primarily driven by the streaming instability. It gives rise to vertical gas motions with a Mach number of up to ${\sim}10^{-2}$. The dust scale height is set in a self-regulatory manner to about $1\%$ of the gas scale height. In contrast, if the vertical shear instability is allowed to saturate before the dust is introduced into our simulations, then it continues to be the main source of the turbulence in the dust layer. The vertical shear instability induces turbulence with a Mach number of ${\sim}10^{-1}$ and thus impedes dust sedimentation. Nonetheless, we find the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability in combination to lead to radial dust concentration in long-lived accumulations which are significantly denser than those formed by the streaming instability alone. Thus, the vertical shear instability may promote planetesimal formation by creating weak overdensities that act as seeds for the streaming instability."

We consider strongly coupled quarkonia, i.e., quarkonia that are not Coulombic bound states. Possible strongly coupled quarkonia include excited charmonium and bottomonium states. For these, pNRQCD provides expressions for the decay and exclusive electromagnetic production NRQCD matrix elements that depend on the wavefunctions at the origin and few universal gluon field correlators. We compute electromagnetic decay widths and exclusive production cross sections, and inclusive decay widths into light hadrons for $P$-wave quarkonia at relative order $v^2$ and leading order, respectively. We also compute the decay widths of $2S$ and $3S$ bottomonium states into lepton pairs and their ratios with the inclusive widths into light hadrons at relative order $v^2$."

These interfacial phenomena play crucial roles for magnetic data storage and transfer applications, which require forming FM nano-structures embedded in non-ferromagnetic matrices. Here, we investigate the possiblity of creating such nano-structures by ion-irradiation. We study the effect of lateral confinement on the ion-irradiation-induced reduction of non-magnetic metal oxides (e.g., antiferro- or paramagnetic) to form ferromagnetic metals. Our findings are later exploited to form 3-dimensional magnetic interfaces between Co, CoO and Pt by spatially-selective irradiation of CoO/Pt multilayers. We demonstrate that the mechanical displacement of the O atoms plays a crucial role during the reduction from insulating, non-ferromagnetic cobalt oxides to metallic cobalt. Metallic cobalt yields both perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the generated Co/Pt nano-structures, and, at low temperatures, exchange bias at vertical interfaces between Co and CoO. If pushed to the limit of ion-irradiation technology, this approach could, in principle, enable the creation of densely-packed, atomic scale ferromagnetic point-contact spin-torque oscillator (STO) networks, or conductive channels for current-confined-path based current perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance read-heads."

We show that diffusion coefficients increase with the anion size and, surprisingly, with the quantity of adsorbed ions. Both findings are interpreted in terms of confinement: when the in-pore population increases additional ions are located in less confined sites and diffuse faster. Simulations in which the pores are enlarged while keeping the topology constant comfort these observations. The interpretation of properties across structures is more challenging. An interesting point is that smaller pores do not necessarily lead to larger confinement. In this work, the highest degrees of confinements are observed for intermediate pore sizes. We also show a correlation between the quantity of adsorbed ions and the ratio between the maximum pore diameter and the pore limiting diameter."

Structures weighing between asteroid and solar masses may be discovered via gravitational microlensing, an astronomical probe that has in the past helped constrain the population of primordial black holes and baryonic MACHOs. We investigate the non-trivial effect of the size of and density distribution within these structures on the microlensing signal, and constrain their populations using the EROS-2 and OGLE-IV surveys. Structures larger than a solar radius are generally constrained more weakly than point-like lenses, but stronger constraints may be obtained for structures with mass distributions that give rise to caustic crossings or produce larger magnifications."

Data   description and properties of the ionised gas,"Using MUSE AO data, we probe the ISM in the local spiral galaxy NGC 7793 at a spatial resolution of $\sim$ 10 pc. We identify HII regions and compile a catalogue of supernova remnants (SNRs), planetary nebulae (PNe) and Wolf Rayet stars (WR). We compute electron densities and temperatures from the [SII]6716/6731 and [SIII]6312/9069 line ratios. We study the properties of the ionised gas through BPT diagrams combined with gas velocity dispersion. We spectroscopically confirm 2 previously detected WR stars and a SNR and report the discovery of 7 WR, 1 SNR, and 2 PNe. The diffuse ionized gas (DIG) fraction is between $\sim$ 27 and 42% depending on the method used to define the HII region boundaries. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the DIG exhibits enhanced [SII]/H$\alpha$ and [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios and a median temperature that is $\sim$ 3000 K higher than in HII regions. We also observe an apparent inverse correlation between temperature and H$\alpha$ surface brightness. Overall, the observed [SII]6716/6731 ratio is consistent within 1$\sigma$ with $n_e$ < 30 cm$^{-3}$, with an almost identical distribution for the DIG and HII regions. The velocity dispersion of the ionised gas indicates that the DIG has a higher degree of turbulence than the HII regions. Comparison with photoionisation and shock models reveals that the diffuse component can only partially be explained via shocks and that it is most likely consistent with photons leaking from density bounded HII regions or with radiation from evolved field stars.

In addition to classical representations using matrices or lists, some compressed data structures have recently been proposed to represent binary relations in compact space, such as the $k^2$-tree and the Binary Relation Wavelet Tree (BRWT). Knowing their storage needs, supported operations and time performance is key for enabling an appropriate choice of data representation given a domain or application, its data distribution and typical operations that are computed over the data.   In this work, we present an empirical comparison among several compressed representations for binary relations. We analyze their space usage and the speed of their operations using different (synthetic and real) data distributions. We include both neighborhood and set operations, also proposing algorithms for set operations for the BRWT, which were not presented before in the literature. We conclude that there is not a clear choice that outperforms the rest, but we give some recommendations of usage of each compact representation depending on the data distribution and types of operations performed over the data. We also include a scalability study of the data representations."

Here we study an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) mean-field neuronal network that has a critical point with power-law avalanches and synaptic balance. When short term depression in inhibitory synapses and firing threshold adaptation are added, the system hovers around the critical point. This homeostatically self-organized quasi-critical (SOqC) dynamics generates E/I synaptic current cancellation in fast time scales, causing fluctuation-driven asynchronous-irregular (AI) firing. We present the full phase diagram of the model without adaptation varying external input versus synaptic coupling. This system has a rich dynamical repertoire of spiking patterns: synchronous regular (SR), asynchronous regular (AR), synchronous irregular (SI), slow oscillations (SO) and AI. It also presents dynamic balance of synaptic currents, since inhibitory currents try and compensate excitatory currents over time, resulting in both of them scaling linearly with external input. Our model thus unifies two different perspectives on cortical spontaneous activity: both critical avalanches and fluctuation-driven AI firing arise from SOqC homeostatic adaptation, and are indeed two sides of the same coin."

Traditionally, a greedy approach has been used to build the trees, yielding a very fast training process; however, controlling sparsity (a proxy for interpretability) is challenging. In recent studies, optimal decision trees, where all decisions are optimized simultaneously, have shown a better learning performance, especially when oblique cuts are implemented. In this paper, we propose a continuous optimization approach to build sparse optimal classification trees, based on oblique cuts, with the aim of using fewer predictor variables in the cuts as well as along the whole tree. Both types of sparsity, namely local and global, are modeled by means of regularizations with polyhedral norms. The computational experience reported supports the usefulness of our methodology. In all our data sets, local and global sparsity can be improved without harming classification accuracy. Unlike greedy approaches, our ability to easily trade in some of our classification accuracy for a gain in global sparsity is shown."

We extract chromospheric indexes, S and Rhk+, for 59,816 stars from LAMOST spectra in the LAMOST-Kepler program, and photospheric index, Reff, for 5575 stars from Kepler light curves. The log Reff shows positive correlation with log Rhk+. We estimate the power-law indexes between Reff and Rhk+ for F-, G-, and K-type stars, respectively. We also confirm the dependence of both chromospheric and photospheric activity on stellar rotation. Ca II H and K emissions and photospheric variations generally decrease with increasing rotation periods for stars with rotation periods exceeding a few days. The power-law indexes in exponential decay regimes show different characteristics in the two activity-rotation relations. The updated largest sample including the activity proxies and reported rotation periods provides more information to understand the magnetic activity for cool stars."

However, the encapsulation poses several questions, namely, how it affects, via the weak van der Waals forces, the properties of the black phosphorus and whether these properties can be tuned on demand. Prompted by these questions, we have investigated the impact of hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation on the structural and vibrational properties of few layer black phosphorus, using a first-principles method in the framework of density functional theory. We demonstrate that the encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride imposes biaxial strain on the black phosphorus material, flattening its puckered structure, by decreasing the thickness of the layers via the increase of the puckered angle and the intra-layer P-P bonds. This work exemplifies the evolution of structural parameters in layered materials after the encapsulation process. We find that after encapsulation, phosphorene (single layer black phosphorous) contracts by 1.1% in the armchair direction and stretches by 1.3% in the zigzag direction, whereas few layer black phosphorus mainly expands by up to 3% in the armchair direction. However, these relatively small strains induced by the hexagonal BN, lead to significant changes in the vibrational properties of black phosphorus, with the redshifts of up to 10 cm$^{-1}$ of the high frequency optical mode $A_g^1$. In general, structural changes induced by the encapsulation process open the door to substrate controlled strain engineering in two-dimensional crystals."

In this study, SWIR was used to produce a hydration level map of the enamel, which was coupled with virtual OCT cross-sections. The study shows a good correlation between levels of hydration and structural damage over the enamel panel. Hydration mapping allows visualisation of structural damage across the entire enamel in one image."

Revealing the organizing principles of this spatial complexity has ramifications for our understanding of morphogenetic processes in plant leaves and animal epithelia, and perhaps even the formation of human fingerprints. We elucidate a primary source of this morphological complexity - an incompatibility between an elastically-favored ""micro-structure"" of uniformly spaced wrinkles and a ""macro-structure"" imparted through the wrinkle director and dictated by confinement forces. Our theory is borne out of experiments and simulations of floating sheets subjected to radial stretching. By analyzing patterns of grossly radial wrinkles we find two sharply distinct morphologies: defect-free patterns with a fixed number of wrinkles and non-uniform spacing, and patterns of uniformly spaced wrinkles separated by defect-rich buffer zones. We show how these morphological types reflect distinct minima of a Ginzburg-Landau functional - a coarse-grained version of the elastic energy, which penalizes nonuniform wrinkle spacing and amplitude, as well as deviations of their actual director from the axis imposed by confinement. Our results extend the effective description of wrinkle patterns as liquid crystals (H. Aharoni et al., Nat. Commun. 8:15809, 2017), and we highlight a fascinating analogy between the geometry-energy interplay that underlies the proliferation of defects in the mechanical equilibrium of confined sheets and in thermodynamic phases of superconductors and chiral liquid crystals."

Hybrid carbon-based hierarchical nanostructures are particularly promising for electrochemical energy storage since they combine benefits of nanosize effects, enhanced electrical conductivity and integrity of bulk materials. We show that endohedral multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) encapsulating high-capacity (here: conversion and alloying) electrode materials have a high potential for use in anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIB). There are two essential characteristics of filled CNT relevant for application in electrochemical energy storage: (1) rigid hollow cavities of the CNT provide upper limits for nanoparticles in their inner cavities which are both separated from the fillings of other CNT and protected against degradation. In particular, the CNT shells resist strong volume changes of encapsulates in response to electrochemical cycling, which in conventional conversion and alloying materials hinders application in energy storage devices. (2) Carbon mantles ensure electrical contact to the active material as they are unaffected by potential cracks of the encapsulate and form a stable conductive network in the electrode compound. Our studies confirm that encapsulates are electrochemically active and can achieve full theoretical reversible capacity. The results imply that encapsulating nanostructures inside CNT can provide a route to new high-performance nanocomposite anode materials for LIB."

We show that the chirally generated entanglement between the qubits can be preserved by controlling the time delay of the feedback. Moreover, when the time delay is negligible, the qubit-qubit reduced system evolves within the strong-coupling regime and the qubits can be almost maximally entangled.

In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the pain-relief potential of a pepducin series derived from the first intracellular loop of neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTS1), a class A GPCR that mediates many of the effects of the neurotensin (NT) tridecapeptide, including hypothermia, hypotension and analgesia. We used BRET-based biosensors to determine the pepducins' ability to engage G protein signaling pathways associated with NTS1 activation. We observed partial Gq and G13 activation at a 10 {\mu}M concentration, indicating that these pepducins may act as allosteric agonists of NTS1. Additionally, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as a label-free assay to monitor pepducin-induced responses in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hNTS1. This whole-cell integrated assay enabled us to subdivide our pepducin series into three profile response groups. In order to determine the pepducins' antinociceptive potential, we then screened the series in an acute pain model (tail-flick test) by measuring tail withdrawal latencies to a thermal nociceptive stimulus, following intrathecal pepducin administration (275 nmol/kg). We further evaluated promising pepducins in a tonic pain model (formalin test), as well as in neuropathic (Chronic Constriction Injury) and inflammatory (Complete Freund's Adjuvant) chronic pain models. We report one pepducin, PP-001, that consistently reduced rat nociceptive behaviors, even in chronic pain paradigm. Altogether, these results suggest that NTS1-derived pepducins may represent a promising strategy in pain-relief."

Unlike indirect methods, high-contrast imaging offers access to atmospheric signatures by separating the light of a faint off-axis source from that of its parent star. Forthcoming space facilities, such as WFIRST/LUVOIR/HabEX, are expected to use coronagraphic instruments capable of imaging and spectroscopy in order to understand the physical properties of remote worlds. The primary technological challenge that drives the design of these instruments involves the precision control of wavefront phase and amplitude errors. Several FPWS and control techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in laboratory to achieve the required accuracy. However, these techniques have never been tested and compared under the same laboratory conditions. This paper compares two of these techniques in a closed loop in visible light: the pair-wise (PW) associated with electric field conjugation (EFC) and self-coherent camera (SCC). We first ran numerical simulations to optimize PW wavefront sensing and to predict the performance of a coronagraphic instrument with PW associated to EFC wavefront control, assuming modeling errors for both PW and EFC. Then we implemented the techniques on a laboratory testbed. We introduced known aberrations into the system and compared the wavefront sensing using both PW and SCC. The speckle intensity in the coronagraphic image was then minimized using PW+EFC and SCC independently. We demonstrate that both SCC and PW+EFC can generate a dark hole in space-like conditions in a few iterations. Both techniques reach the current limitation of our laboratory bench and provide coronagraphic contrast levels of 5e-9 in a narrow spectral band (<0.25% bandwidth)"

This process could be performed with various methods, each one affecting differently the biological structure of the sample. While these alterations were well-characterized using traditional microscopy, little information is available about the effects of the fixatives on the spatial molecular orientation of the biological tissue. We tackled this issue by employing Rotating-Polarization Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (RP-CARS) microscopy to study the effects of different fixatives on the myelin sub-micrometric molecular order and micrometric morphology. RP-CARS is a novel technique derived from CARS microscopy that allows probing spatial orientation of molecular bonds while maintaining the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS microscopy. By characterizing the effects of the fixation procedures, the present work represents a useful guide for the choice of the best fixation technique(s), in particular for polarisation-resolved CARS microscopy. Finally, we show that the combination of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde can be effectively employed as a fixative for RP-CARS microscopy, as long as the effects on the molecular spatial distribution, here characterized, are taken into account."

In order to meet the researchers demand in the areas of physics, chemistry, materials sciences, engineering, cultural heritage, biology and earth sciences, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will provide 3 thermal guides and 3 cold guides, with the installation of several instruments for materials characterization. In this study, we present a standard design requirement of two primordial instruments, namely Sabi\'a and Araponga. They are, respectively, cold and thermal neutron instruments and correspond to a Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and High-Resolution Powder Neutron Diffractometer (HRPND) to be installed in the Neutron Guide Building (N02) of RMB. To provide adequate flux for both instruments, we propose here an initial investigation of the use of simple and split guides to transport neutron beams to two different instruments on the same guide. For this purpose, we use Monte Carlo simulations utilizing McStas software to check the efficiency of thermal neutron transport for different basic configuration and sources. By considering these results, it is possible to conclude that the split guide configuration is, in most cases, more efficient than cases that use transmitted neutron beams independently of source. We also verify that the employment of different coating indexes for concave and convex surfaces on curved guides is crucial, at least on simulated cases, to optimise neutron flux (intensity and divergence) and diminish facility installation cost."

Using this condition, we obtain a differential equation of the entropy of the de Sitter black hole in the higherdimensional de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. Solving the differential equation, we obtain the corrected entropy and effective thermodynamic quantities of the de Sitter black hole. The results show that for multiparameter black holes, the entropy satisfied differential equation is invariable with different independent state parameters. Therefore, the entropy of higher-dimensional dS black holes in dRGT massive gravity is only a function of the position of the black hole horizon, and is independent of other state parameters. It is consistent with the corresponding entropy of the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon. The thermodynamic quantities of self-consistent de Sitter spacetime are given theoretically, and the equivalent thermodynamic quantities have the second-order phase transformation similar to AdS black hole, but unlike AdS black hole, the equivalent temperature of de Sitter space-time has a maximum value. By satisfying the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium and stability of space-time, the conditions for the existence of dS black holes in the universe are obtained."

It is demonstrated that for potentials of $|x|^\nu$ ($\nu>0$) type energies are equipartitioned for the harmonic potential only. For potential wells weaker than parabolic potential energy dominates, while for potentials stronger than parabolic kinetic energy prevails. Due to energy conservation, the variances of kinetic and potential energies are equal. In the limiting case of the infinite rectangular potential well ($\nu\to\infty$) the whole energy is stored in the form of the kinetic energy and variances of energy distributions vanish."

Its phase change in the liquid is variously described as a metallization, H2-dissociation, density discontinuity or plasma phase transition. It has been tacitly assumed that these phenomena coincide at a first-order liquid-liquid transition (LLT). In this work, the relevant pressure-temperature conditions are thoroughly explored with first-principles molecular dynamics. We show there is a large dependency on exchange-correlation functional and significant finite size effects. We use hysteresis in a number of measurable quantities to demonstrate a first-order transition up to a critical point, above which molecular and atomic liquids are indistinguishable. At higher temperature beyond the critical point, H2-dissociation becomes a smooth cross-over in the supercritical region that can be modelled by a pseudo-transition, where the H2-2H transformation is localized and does not cause a density discontinuity at metallization. Thermodynamic anomalies and counter-intuitive transport behavior of protons are also discovered even far beyond the critical point, making this dissociative transition highly relevant to the interior dynamics of Jovian planets. Below the critical point, simulation also reveals a dynamic H2-2H chemical equilibrium with rapid interconversion, showing that H2 and H are miscible. The predicted critical temperature lies well below the ionization temperature. Our calculations unequivocally demonstrate that there are three distinct regimes in the liquid-liquid transition of warm dense hydrogen."

Here, we apply the growth protocol for CdS branched nanocrystals on CdSe nanoplatelet seeds and obtain bone-shaped heterostructures with a highly anisotropic shell. Surprisingly, the nanoplatelets withstand the high growth temperature of 350 {\deg}C and we obtain structures with a CdSe nanoplatelet core that is overcoated by a shell of cubic CdS, on top of which tetrahedral CdS structures with hexagonal lattice are formed. These complex core/shell nanocrystals show a bandedge emission around 657 nm with a photoluminescence quantum yield of ca. 42 % in solution, which is also retained in thin films. Interestingly, the nanocrystals manifest simultaneous red and green emission, and the relatively long wavelength of the green emission indicates charge recombination at the cubic/hexagonal interface of the CdS shell. The nanocrystal films show amplified spontaneous emission, random lasing, and distributed feedback lasing when the material is deposited on suitable gratings. Our work stimulates the design and fabrication of more exotic core/shell heterostructures where charge carrier delocalization, dipole moment, and other optical and electrical properties can be engineered."

We study the information flow networks of the Chinese stock market and identify important sectors and information flow paths. This paper uses the daily closing price data of the 28 level-1 sectors from Shenyin \& Wanguo Securities ranging from 2000 to 2017 to study the information transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the corresponding edges. Then we adopt the maximum spanning arborescence (MSA) to extracting important information flows and the hierarchical structure of the networks. We find that, during the whole sample period, the \textit{composite} sector is an information source of the whole stock market, while the \textit{non-bank financial} sector is the information sink. We also find that the \textit{non-bank finance}, \textit{bank}, \textit{computer}, \textit{media}, \textit{real estate}, \textit{medical biology} and \textit{non-ferrous metals} sectors appear as high-degree root nodes in the outgoing and incoming information flow MSAs. Especially, the \textit{non-bank finance} and \textit{bank} sectors have significantly high degrees after 2008 in the outgoing information flow networks. We uncover how stock market turmoils affect the structure of the MSAs. Finally, we reveal the specificity of information source and sink sectors and make a conclusion that the root node sector as the information sink of the incoming information flow networks. Overall, our analyses show that the structure of information flow networks changes with time and the market exhibits a sector rotation phenomenon.

This has been tested in the well-known [TbPc2]0 SMM, which allowed the implementation of the Grover algorithm in a single molecular unit. In the quest for molecular systems possessing an increased number of accessible nuclear spin states, we explore herein a dimeric Tb2-SMM via single crystal {\mu}-SQUID measurements at sub-Kelvin temperatures. We observe ferromagnetic interactions between the Tb(III) ions and cooperative quantum tunneling of the electronic spins with spin ground state \textit{J} = {\pm}6. The strong hyperfine coupling with the Tb(III) nuclear spins leads to a multitude of spin reversal paths leading to seven strong hyperfine driven tunneling steps in the hysteresis loops. Our results show the possibility to read-out the Tb(III) nuclear spin states via the cooperative tunneling of the electronic spins, making the dimeric Tb2-SMM an excellent nuclear spin qudit candidate with d =16."

Long in vivo scan times due to repeated three-dimensional (3D) volume sampling over cardiac phases and breathing cycles necessitate accelerated imaging techniques that leverage data correlations. Standard compressed sensing reconstruction methods require tuning of hyperparameters and are computationally expensive, which diminishes the potential reduction of examination times. We propose an efficient model-based deep neural reconstruction network and evaluate its performance on clinical aortic flow data. The network is shown to reconstruct undersampled 4D flow MRI data in under a minute on standard consumer hardware. Remarkably, the relatively low amounts of tunable parameters allowed the network to be trained on images from 11 reference scans while generalizing well to retrospective and prospective undersampled data for various acceleration factors and anatomies."

Stacked Metal/Insulator/Metal (MIM) nanocavities constitute a highly versatile and very interesting model system to study and engineer such mode coupling, since they can be realized by lithography-free fabrication methods with fine control on the optical and geometrical parameters. The resonant modes of such MIM cavities are epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances, which are appealing for non-linear photophysics and a variety of applications. Here we study the hybridization of ENZ resonances in MIMIM nanocavities, obtaining a very large mode splitting reaching 0.477 eV, Q factors of the order of 40 in the visible spectral range, and fine control on the resonance wavelength and mode linewidth by tuning the thickness of the dielectric and metallic layers. A semi-classical approach that analyses the MIMIM structure as a double quantum well system allows to derive the exact analytical dispersion relation of the ENZ resonances, achieving perfect agreement with numerical simulations and experiments. Interestingly, the asymmetry of the mode splitting in a symmetric MIMIM cavity is not reflected in the classical model of coupled oscillators, which can be directly related to quantum mechanical tunneling for the coupling of the two cavities. Interpreting the cavity resonances as resonant tunneling modes elucidates that can be excited without momentum matching techniques. The broad tunability of high-quality ENZ resonances together with their strong coupling efficiency makes such MIMIM cavities an ideal platform for exploring light-matter interaction, for example, by integration of quantum emitters in the dielectric layers."

This produces a strong photo-thermoelectric conversion, which simultaneously leads to a combination of high sensitivity (NEP $\leq$ 160 $pWHz^{-1/2}$), fast response time ($\leq 3.3 ns$) and a four orders of magnitude dynamic range, making our devices the fastest, broadband, low noise, room temperature THz PD to date."

In contrast with the bulk phase, monolayer AlB$_2$ is predicted to be a superconductor with a high critical temperature. Here, we demonstrate that monolayer AlB$_2$ can be synthesized on Al(111) via molecular beam epitaxy. Our theoretical calculations revealed that the monolayer AlB$_2$ hosts several Dirac cones along the $\Gamma$--M and $\Gamma$--K directions; these Dirac cones are protected by crystal symmetries and are thus resistant to external perturbations. The extraordinary electronic structure of the monolayer AlB$_2$ was confirmed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. These results are likely to stimulate further research interest to explore the exotic properties arising from the interplay of Dirac fermions and superconductivity in two-dimensional materials."

Recently there have been attempts to explain this observation on the basis of ``typicality of perturbations'' with respect to their impact on expectation value dynamics. These theories suggest that a majority of the very numerous, possible Hamiltonian perturbations entail more or less the same type of alteration of the decay dynamics. Thus, in this paper, we study how the approach towards equilibrium in closed quantum systems is altered due to weak perturbations. To this end, we perform numerical experiments on a particular, exemplary spin system. We compare our numerical data to predictions from three particular theories. We find satisfying agreement in the weak perturbation regime for one of these approaches."

Generally, senders and receivers are unaware about the process of encryption and decryption. Hence, encryption plays an important role in data communication and data security. The meaning of encryption is not only to keep data confidential from unwanted access but also ensuring the data integrity through available way. As the capacity of breaking the security is increasing rapidly, so, the process that hides information is one of the most concerned topics. Advanced Encryption Standard is a popular, widely used and efficient encryption algorithm, which has been used since it was invented. This paper focuses on the AES key generation process and Substitution box. It modifies the conventional key generation technique and builds the dynamic 3-Dimensional S-box of Advance Encryption Standard. The proposed approach suggests 3-Dimensioanl Key Generation Matrix and S-box. As per shown this novel technique increases the amount of time it needs during encryption and decryption. The experimental result shows that it also enhances the strength of AES algorithm. The proposed approach illustrates the theoretical analysis and corresponding experimented results."

Recent models have shown that turbulent flows and waves, including internal gravity waves, may play an important role in cloud evolution.   The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of IGW on dust nucleation and dust growth, and whether observations of the resulting cloud structures could be used to recover atmospheric density information.   For a simplified atmosphere in two dimensions, we numerically solved the governing fluid equations to simulate the effect on dust nucleation and mantle growth as a result of the passage of an IGW. Furthermore, we derived an expression that relates the properties of the wave-induced cloud structures to observable parameters in order to deduce the atmospheric density.   Numerical simulations show that the $\rho, p, T$ variations caused by gravity waves lead to an increase of the nucleation rate by up to a factor 20, and an increase of the mantle growth rate by up to a factor 1.6, compared to their equilibrium values. An exploration of the wider parameter space shows that in absolute terms, the increase in nucleation due to IGW is stronger in cooler (T dwarfs) and TiO2-rich sub-stellar atmospheres. The relative increase, however, is greater in warmer (L dwarf) and TiO2-poor atmospheres due to conditions less suited for efficient nucleation at equilibrium. These variations lead to banded areas in which dust formation is much more pronounced, similar to the cloud structures observed on Earth.   We show that IGW in the atmosphere of sub-stellar objects can produce banded clouds structures similar to that observed on Earth. We propose a method with which potential observations of banded clouds could be used to estimate the atmospheric density of sub-stellar objects."

Specifically, we focus on the elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) modeling the pressure field inside the tumor. The permeability field is modeled as a log-Gaussian random field with a prespecified covariance function. We numerically explore dimension reduction of the input parameter and model output. Truncated Karhunen--Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansions are used to decompose the log-permeability field, as well as the resulting random pressure field. We find that although very high-dimensional representations are needed to accurately represent the permeability field, especially in presence of small correlation lengths, the pressure field is not very sensitive to high-order KL terms of the input parameter. Moreover, we find that the pressure field itself can be represented accurately using a KL expansion with a small number of terms. These observations are used to guide a reduced-order modeling approach to accelerate computational studies of biotransport in tumors."

In order to respect the natural properties of this configuration, we foliate the spatial domain with 2-spheres. It is then a consequence of these equations that they must be solved as an initial value problem evolving outwards towards spacelike infinity. Choosing the free data and the ""strong field boundary conditions"" for these equations in a way which mimics asymptotically flat and asymptotically spherical binary black hole initial data sets, our focus in this paper is on the analysis of the asymptotics of the solutions. In agreement with our earlier results, our combination of analytical and numerical tools reveals that these solutions are in general not asymptotically flat, but have a cone geometry instead. In order to remedy this and approximate asymptotically Euclidean data sets, we then propose and test an iterative numerical scheme."

RRAT J1854+0306 exhibited a time-dynamic mean pulse profile, whereas RRAT J1913+1330 showed distinct radiation and nulling segments on its pulse intensity trains. The mean pulse profile variation with frequency is also studied for RRAT J1538+2345 and RRAT J1913+1330, and the profiles at different frequencies could be well fitted with a cone-core model and a conal-beam model, respectively."

We express the mean and the variance of $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ as a function of the 1- and 2-point functions of $\rho$. These results generalize results obtained previously, that were valid only for central collisions, or only for identical point-like sources.

Reaction rates are different whenever chemical reaction occurs due to their dependence on the number of reaction events or the product number. As such, understanding the impact of rate fluctuation on product number counting statistics is of the utmost importance when developing a quantitative explanation of chemical reactions. In this work, we present a master equation that describes reaction rates as a function of product number and time. Our equal reveals the relationship between the reaction rate and product number fluctuation. Product number counting statistics uncovers a stochastic property of the product number; product number directly manipulates the reaction rate. Specifically, we find that product number shows super-Poisson characteristics when the product number increases, inducing an increase in the reaction rate. While, on the other hand, when the product number shows sub-Poisson characteristics with an increase in the product number, this is induced by a decrease in the reaction rate. Furthermore, our analysis exploits reaction rate fluctuation, enabling the quantification of the deviation of an elementary reaction process from a renewal process."

Besides that, two nonlinear controllers are constructed precisely to shift the equilibria of the plasma model apart from each other. Simulation results show that shifting the equilibria can change the spacing of chaotic attractors, and subsequently break the butterfly wings into one or two symmetric pair of coexisting chaotic attractors. Furthermore, stretching the equilibria of the system apart enough from each other gives rise to degenerate the butterfly wings into several periodic orbits. In addition, with appropriate initial conditions, the complex multistability behaviors including the coexistence of butterfly chaotic attractor with two point attractors, the coexistence of transient transition chaos with completely quasi-periodic behavior, and the coexistence of symmetric Hopf bifurcations are also observed."

In this theory, fundamental matter fields are coupled to the Chern-Simons theory in a way that depends only on a transverse holomorphic structure on a manifold; they are not fully dynamical, but the theory is also not fully topological. One description of this theory arises from topological strings on the deformed conifold $T^* S^3$ with $N$ Lagrangian 3-branes and additional coisotropic `flavor' 5-branes. Applying the idea of the Gopakumar-Vafa duality to this setup, we suggest that this has a dual description as a topological string on the resolved conifold ${\cal O} \left( - 1 \right) \oplus {\cal O} \left( - 1 \right) \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1$, in the presence of coisotropic 5-branes. We test this duality by computing the annulus amplitude on the deformed conifold and the disc amplitude on the resolved conifold via equivariant localization, and we find an agreement between the two. We find a small discrepancy between the topological string results and the large $N$ limit of the partition function of the PTCSM theory arising from the deformed conifold, computed via field theory localization by a method proposed by Aganagic et al. We discuss possible origins of the mismatch."

Systems of this type describe chemotaxis-fluid interaction in cases when the evolution of the chemoattractant is essentially dominated by production through cells. If $m>1$ and $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a {\bf bounded} domain with smooth boundary, then for all reasonably regular initial data, a corresponding initial-boundary value problem for $(KSNF)$ possesses a global and bounded (weak) solution, which significantly improves previous results of several authors. Moreover, the {\bf optimal condition} on the parameter $m$ for global existence is obtained. Our approach underlying the derivation of main result is based on an entropy-like estimate involving the functional %Our main tool is consideration of the energy functional $$\int_{\Omega}(n_{\varepsilon} +\varepsilon)^{m}+\int_{\Omega}|\nabla c_\varepsilon|^{2},$$ where $n_\varepsilon$ and $c_\varepsilon$ are components of the solutions to (2.1) below."

As such, it is the subject of frequent scrutiny and extensive biomechanical analyses. In this paper, we introduce the notion of golf swing sequencing for detecting key events in the golf swing and facilitating golf swing analysis. To enable consistent evaluation of golf swing sequencing performance, we also introduce the benchmark database GolfDB, consisting of 1400 high-quality golf swing videos, each labeled with event frames, bounding box, player name and sex, club type, and view type. Furthermore, to act as a reference baseline for evaluating golf swing sequencing performance on GolfDB, we propose a lightweight deep neural network called SwingNet, which possesses a hybrid deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architecture. SwingNet correctly detects eight golf swing events at an average rate of 76.1%, and six out of eight events at a rate of 91.8%. In line with the proposed baseline SwingNet, we advocate the use of computationally efficient models in future research to promote in-the-field analysis via deployment on readily-available mobile devices."

The time delay is due to the finite time needed to measure the incoming disturbance and then apply the correction. By predicting the behavior of the atmospheric disturbance over the time delay we can in principle achieve a better AO performance. Atmospheric turbulence parameters which determine the wavefront phase fluctuations have time-varying behavior. We present a stochastic model for wind speed and model time-variant atmospheric turbulence effects using varying wind speed. We test a low-order, data-driven predictor, the linear minimum mean square error predictor, for a near-infrared AO system under varying conditions. Our results show varying wind can have a significant impact on the performance of wavefront prediction, preventing it from reaching optimal performance. The impact depends on the strength of the wind fluctuations with the greatest loss in expected performance being for high wind speeds."

The polarization of the radiation, as modified by Faraday rotation effects in the ISM, also contains extensive information about the magnetic field. Comprehensive all-sky broadband mapping of this radiation, when combined with high frequency radio data, gamma ray data, cosmic ray (CR) measurements and sophisticated modeling, can revolutionize our understanding of the ISM and the processes that influence its evolution.   Current widefield imagery of the galactic synchrotron emission is heterogeneous in frequency coverage, sky coverage, angular resolution and calibration accuracy, limiting utility for ISM studies. A new generation of all-digital low frequency array technologies is opening a path to matched resolution, high fidelity polarimetric imaging across a fully sampled swath of radio frequencies from a few tens to many hundreds of MHz, generating a transformational dataset for a broad range of scientific applications."

Such nonlinear stiff systems may arise, for example, from Galerkin approximations of controlled stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), or controlled PDEs with uncertain initial conditions and source terms. This implies that DNNs can break the curse of dimensionality in numerical approximations and optimal control of PDEs and SPDEs. The main ingredient of our proof is to construct a suitable discrete-time system to effectively approximate the evolution of the underlying stochastic dynamics. Similar ideas can also be applied to obtain expression rates of DNNs for value functions induced by stiff systems with regime switching coefficients and driven by general L\'{e}vy noise."

We also see an emerging need to handle datasets with very large samples, where memory requirements for training are large. Existing training frameworks use a data-parallel approach that partitions samples within a mini-batch, but limits to scaling the mini-batch size and memory consumption makes this untenable for large samples. We describe and implement new approaches to convolution, which parallelize using spatial decomposition or a combination of sample and spatial decomposition. This introduces many performance knobs for a network, so we develop a performance model for CNNs and present a method for using it to automatically determine efficient parallelization strategies.   We evaluate our algorithms with microbenchmarks and image classification with ResNet-50. Our algorithms allow us to prototype a model for a mesh-tangling dataset, where sample sizes are very large. We show that our parallelization achieves excellent strong and weak scaling and enables training for previously unreachable datasets."

Additional properties like analyticity of the semigroup, $\mathrm{H}^\infty$-calculus and maximal regularity are also discussed. Finally we prove a perturbation result for real coefficients that gives the whole range of $p$'s for small imaginary parts of the coefficients. Our results are based on the recent notion of $p$-ellipticity, reverse H\""older inequalities and Gaussian estimates for the real coefficients."

Combining spin-down rates, magnetic activity, and association with supernova remnants, we put a 2$\sigma$ limit on their Galactic formation rate at $2.3-20\mbox{kyr}^{-1}$. This leads to a fraction $0.4_{-0.28}^{+0.6}$ of neutron stars being born as magnetars. We study evolutionary channels that can account for this rate as well as for the periods, period derivatives and luminosities of the observed population. We find that their typical magnetic fields at birth are $3\times 10^{14}-10^{15}$G, and that those decay on a time-scale of $\sim 10^4$years, implying a maximal magnetar period of $P_{\rm max}\approx 13$s. A sizable fraction of the magnetars' energy is released in outbursts. Giant Flares with $E\geq 10^{46}$ erg are expected to occur in the Galaxy at a rate of $\sim 5\mbox{kyr}^{-1}$. Outside our Galaxy, such flares remain observable by {\it Swift} up to a distance of $\sim 100$~Mpc, implying a detection rate of $\sim 5\mbox{ yr}^{-1}$. The specific form of magnetic energy decay is shown to be strongly tied to the total number of observable magnetars in the Galaxy. A systematic survey searching for magnetars could determine the former and inform physical models of magnetic field decay."

We also show that a WH (Weyl Heisenberg covariant) SIC in odd dimension d is naturally associated to a pair of symmetric tight fusion frames in dimension d. We deduce two relaxations of the WH SIC existence problem. We also find a reformulation of the problem in which the number of equations is fewer than the number of variables. Finally, we show that in at least four cases the structures associated to a SIC lie on continuous manifolds of such structures. In two of these cases the manifolds are non-linear. Restricted defect calculations are consistent with this being true for the structures associated to every known SIC with d between 3 and 16, suggesting it may be true for all d greater than 2."

Academic performance prediction is an important building block to enabling this pre-intervention and guidance. Most of the previous studies are based on questionnaire surveys and self-reports, which suffer from small sample size and social desirability bias. In this paper, we collect longitudinal behavioral data from 6,597 students' smart cards and propose three major types of discriminative behavioral factors, diligence, orderliness, and sleep patterns. Empirical analysis demonstrates these behavioral factors are strongly correlated with academic performance. Furthermore, motivated by social influence theory, we analyze the correlation between each student's academic performance with his/her behaviorally similar students'. Statistical tests indicate this correlation is significant. Based on these factors, we further build a multi-task predictive framework based on a learning-to-rank algorithm for academic performance prediction. This framework captures inter-semester correlation, inter-major correlation and integrates student similarity to predict students' academic performance. The experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our methods for predicting academic performance and the effectiveness of proposed behavioral factors."

In particular, it was demonstrated by Feldbrugge et al. that the sum over all universes starting from zero size results in an unstable saddle point geometry. Here we show that in the context of gravity with a positive cosmological constant, path integrals with a specific family of Robin boundary conditions overcome this problem. These path integrals are manifestly convergent and are approximated by stable Hartle-Hawking saddle point geometries. The price to pay is that the off-shell geometries do not start at zero size. The Robin boundary conditions may be interpreted as an initial state with Euclidean momentum, with the quantum uncertainty shared between initial size and momentum."

Unlike visible light, Radio Frequency (RF) signals penetrate opaque obstructions and reflect highly off humans. This paper establishes a deep-learning model that can be trained to reconstruct continuous video of a 15-point human skeleton even through visual occlusion. The training process adopts a student/teacher learning procedure inspired by the Feynman learning technique, in which video frames and RF data are first collected simultaneously using a co-located setup containing an optical camera and an RF antenna array transceiver. Next, the video frames are processed with a computer-vision-based gait analysis ""teacher"" module to generate ground-truth human skeletons for each frame. Then, the same type of skeleton is predicted from corresponding RF data using a ""student"" deep-learning model consisting of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Region Proposal Network (RPN), and Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that 1) extracts spatial features from RF images, 2) detects all people present in a scene, and 3) aggregates information over many time-steps, respectively. The model is shown to both accurately and completely predict the pose of humans behind visual obstruction solely using RF signals. Primary academic contributions include the novel many-to-many imaging methodology, unique integration of RPN and LSTM networks, and original training pipeline."

Although some previous work\cite{gilad2017we}\cite{heilman2014consent} points it out explicitly or implicitly, further measurement and analysis remain to be done. Our work measures and analyzes the invalid prefixes systematically. We first classify the invalid prefixes into six different types and then analyze their stability. We show that a large proportion of the invalid prefixes very likely result from traffic engineering, IP address transfer and failing to aggregate rather than real hijackings."

However, due to the nonconvexity of the objective and constraints, the optimized solution is not easy to obtain. We propose an alternating linearized minimization method to solve it with provable convergence rate and guarantee.

During the past decades, different techniques have been proposed for constructing ranking models, from traditional heuristic methods, probabilistic methods, to modern machine learning methods. Recently, with the advance of deep learning technology, we have witnessed a growing body of work in applying shallow or deep neural networks to the ranking problem in IR, referred to as neural ranking models in this paper. The power of neural ranking models lies in the ability to learn from the raw text inputs for the ranking problem to avoid many limitations of hand-crafted features. Neural networks have sufficient capacity to model complicated tasks, which is needed to handle the complexity of relevance estimation in ranking. Since there have been a large variety of neural ranking models proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we will take a deep look into the neural ranking models from different dimensions to analyze their underlying assumptions, major design principles, and learning strategies. We compare these models through benchmark tasks to obtain a comprehensive empirical understanding of the existing techniques. We will also discuss what is missing in the current literature and what are the promising and desired future directions."

Here, we present a rigorous derivation of the NRPMD Hamiltonian and investigate its performance on simulating excited state non-adiabatic dynamics. Our derivation is based on the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping representation for electronic states and the ring-polymer path-integral description for nuclei, resulting in the same Hamiltonian proposed in the original NRPMD approach. In addition, we investigate the accuracy of using NRPMD to simulate photoinduced non-adiabatic dynamics in simple model systems. These model calculations suggest that NRPMD can alleviate the zero-point energy leakage problem that is commonly encountered in the classical Wigner dynamics, and provide accurate excited states non-adiabatic dynamics. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation of the promising NRPMD Hamiltonian and demonstrates the possibility of using state-dependent RPMD approach to accurately simulate electronic non-adiabatic dynamics while explicitly quantize nuclei."

First, we consider the problem of reaching a set $S$ in a user-defined or prescribed time $T$. We define a new class of control Lyapunov functions, called prescribed-time control Lyapunov functions (PT CLF), and present sufficient conditions on the existence of a controller for this problem in terms of PT CLF. Then, we formulate a quadratic program (QP) to compute a control input that satisfies these sufficient conditions. Next, we consider control synthesis under spatio-temporal objectives given as: the closed-loop trajectories remain in a given set $S_s$ at all times; and, remain in a specific set $S_i$ during the time interval $[t_i, t_{i+1})$ for $i = 0, 1, \cdots, N$; and, reach the set $S_{i+1}$ on or before $t = t_{i+1}$. We show that such spatio-temporal specifications can be translated into temporal logic formulas. We present sufficient conditions on the existence of a control input in terms of PT CLF and control barrier functions. Then, we present a QP to compute the control input efficiently, and show its feasibility under the assumptions of existence of a PT CLF. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first paper proposing a QP based method for the aforementioned problem of satisfying spatio-temporal specifications for nonlinear control-affine dynamics with input constraints. We also discuss the limitations of the proposed methods and directions of future work to overcome these limitations. We present numerical examples to corroborate our proposed methods."

To compute these diagrams using lattice techniques, one generally uses stochastic noise methods. These employ a randomly generated set of noise vectors to project out physical signals. In order to strengthen the signal in these calculations, various noise subtraction techniques may be employed. In addition to the standard method of perturbative subtraction, one may also employ matrix deflation techniques using the GMRES-DR and MINRES-DR algorithms as well as polynomial subtraction techniques to reduce statistical uncertainty. Our matrix deflation methods play two roles: they both speed up the solution of the linear equations as well as decrease numerical noise. We show how to combine deflation with either perturbative and polynomial methods to produce extremely powerful noise suppression algorithms. We use a variety of lattices to study the effects. In order to set a benchmark, we first use the Wilson matrix in the quenched approximation. We see strong low eigenmode dominance at kappa critical ($\kappa_{crit}$) in the variance of the vector and scalar operators. We also use MILC dynamic lattices, where we observe deflation subtraction results consistent with the effectiveness seen in the quenched data."

By means of BSDE methods, in particular that of the notion from Peng's stochastic \textit{% backward semigroups}, we prove a dynamic programming principle for both the upper and the lower value functions of the game. The upper and the lower value functions are then shown to be the unique viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equations with a double-obstacle. As a consequence, the uniqueness implies that the upper and lower value functions coincide and the game admits a value."

Our goal is to stably determine a real vector field from the dynamical Dirichlet-to Neumann map.

Here we generalize these results, with appropriate modifications, to a much wider class of random processes generating elements of $F_N$. We introduce the notion of a ''$(M,\lambda, \epsilon)$-minimal"" conjugacy class $[w]$ in $F_N$, where $M\ge 1, \lambda>1$ and $0<\epsilon<1$. Roughly, being $(M,\lambda, \epsilon)$-minimal means that every $\phi\in Out(F_N)$ either increases the length $||w||_A$ by a factor of at least $\lambda$, or distorts the length $||w||_A$ multiplicatively by a factor $\epsilon$-close to $1$, and that the number of automorphically minimal $[u]$ in the orbit $Out(F_N)[w]$ is bounded by $M$. We then show that if a conjugacy class $[w]$ in $F_N$ is sufficiently close to a ""filling"" projective geodesic current $[\nu]\in PCurr(F_N)$, then, after applying a single ""reducing"" automorphism $\psi=\psi(\nu)\in Out(F_N)$ depending on $\nu$ only, the element $\psi([w])$ is $(M,\lambda, \epsilon)$-minimal for some uniform constants $M,\lambda,\epsilon$. Consequently, for such $[w]$, Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem in $F_N$ works in quadratic time on the input $([w], [w'])$ where $[w']$ is arbitrary, and in linear time if $[w']$ is also projectively close to $[\nu]$. We then show that a wide class of random processes produce ""random"" conjugacy classes $[w_n]$ that projectively converge to some filling current in $PCurr(F_N)$. For such $[w_n]$ Whitehead's algorithm has at most quadratic generic-case complexity."

Spotlight allows users to search for files or information by querying databases populated with filesystem attributes, metadata, and indexed textual content. Existing forensic research into Spotlight has provided an understanding of the metadata attributes stored within the metadata store database. Current approaches in the literature have also enabled the extraction of metadata records for extant files, but not for deleted files. The objective of this paper is to research the persistence of records for deleted files within Spotlight's metadata store, identify if deleted database pages are recoverable from unallocated space on the volume, and to present a strategy for the processing of discovered records. In this paper, the structure of the metadata store database is outlined, and experimentation reveals that records persist for a period of time within the database but once deleted, are no longer recoverable. The experimentation also demonstrates that deleted pages from the database (containing metadata records) are recoverable from unused space on the filesystem."

Fatness of an element can be decided efficiently in practice by testing whether its characteristic polynomial has an irreducible factor of degree greater than $d/2$. We show that for groups $G$ with $ \textrm{SL}(d,q) \leq G \leq \textrm{GL}(d,q) $ most pairs of fat elements from $G$ generate irreducible subgroups, namely we prove that the proportion of pairs of fat elements generating a reducible subgroup, in the set of all pairs in $ G \times G $, is less than $q^{-d+1}$. We also prove that the conditional probability to obtain a pair $(g_1,g_2)$ in $G \times G$ which generates a reducible subgroup, given that $g_1, g_2$ are fat elements, is less than $2q^{-d+1}$. Further, we show that any reducible subgroup generated by a pair of fat elements acts irreducibly on a subspace of dimension greater than $ d/2 $, and in the induced action the generating pair corresponds to a pair of fat elements."

We find that the present experimental data can support this charmonium assignment to $Y(4220)$. Thus, $Y(4220)$ plays a role of a scaling point in constructing higher charmonia above 4 GeV. To further test this scenario, we provide more abundant information on the decay properties of $Y(4220)$, and predict its charmonium partner $\psi(4380)$, whose evidence is found by analyzing the $e^+e^-\to \psi(3686)\pi^+\pi^-$ data from BESIII. If $Y(4220)$ is indeed a charmonium, we must face how to settle the established charmonium $\psi(4415)$ in the $J/\psi$ family. In this work, we may introduce a $5S$-$4D$ mixing scheme, and obtain the information of the resonance parameters and partial open-charm decay widths of $\psi(4415)$, which do not contradict the present experimental data. Additionally, we predict a charmonium partner $\psi(4500)$ of $\psi(4415)$, which can be accessible at future experiments, especially, BESIII and BelleII. The studies presented in this work provide new insights to establish the higher charmonium spectrum."

Such networks require less storage and have lower computational complexity compared to their dense counterparts. The Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET) procedure uses weights magnitude to evolve efficiently the topology of a sparse network to fit the dataset, while enabling it to have quadratically less parameters than its dense counterpart. To this end, we propose a novel approach that evolves a sparse network topology based on the behavior of neurons in the network. More exactly, the cosine similarities between the activations of any two neurons are used to determine which connections are added to or removed from the network. By integrating our approach within the SET procedure, we propose 5 new algorithms to train sparse neural networks. We argue that our approach has low additional computational complexity and we draw a parallel to Hebbian learning. Experiments are performed on 8 datasets taken from various domains to demonstrate the general applicability of our approach. Even without optimizing hyperparameters for specific datasets, the experiments show that our proposed training algorithms usually outperform SET and state-of-the-art dense neural network techniques. The last but not the least, we show that the evolved connectivity patterns of the input neurons reflect their impact on the classification task."

For a finite group $K$ and a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic 0, the lattice of ideals of the Green biset functor $\mathbb{F}B_K$ obtained by shifting the Burnside functor $\mathbb{F}B$ by $K$ is described in terms of {\em $B_K$-groups}. It is shown that any finite group $(L,\varphi)$ over $K$ admits a {\em largest quotient $B_K$-group} $\beta_K(L,\varphi)$. The simple subquotients of $\mathbb{F}B_K$ are parametrized by $B_K$-groups, and their evaluations can be precisely determined. Finally, when $p$ is a prime, the restriction $\mathbb{F}B_K^{(p)}$ of $\mathbb{F}B_K$ to finite $p$-groups is considered, and the structure of the lattice of ideals of the Green functor $\mathbb{F}B_K^{(p)}$ is described in full detail.

Our scheme is theoretically rooted in a novel result that establishes that the phase dynamics of coupled oscillator systems, under the influence of sub-harmonic injection locking, are governed by a Lyapunov function that is closely related to the Ising Hamiltonian of the coupling graph. As a result, the dynamics of such oscillator networks evolve naturally to local minima of the Lyapunov function. Two simple additional steps (i.e., adding noise, and turning sub-harmonic locking on and off smoothly) enable the network to find excellent solutions of Ising problems. We demonstrate our method on Ising versions of the MAX-CUT and graph colouring problems, showing that it improves on previously published results on several problems in the G benchmark set. Our scheme, which is amenable to realisation using many kinds of oscillators from different physical domains, is particularly well suited for CMOS IC implementation, offering significant practical advantages over previous techniques for making Ising machines. We present working hardware prototypes using CMOS electronic oscillators."

Such a network may contain nodes other than the given sources and sinks, called Steiner points. We characterise the local structure of the Steiner points in all shortest-length directed networks in the Euclidean plane. This characterisation implies that these networks are constructible by straightedge and compass. Our results build on unpublished work of Alfaro, Campbell, Sher, and Soto from 1989 and 1990. Part of the proof is based on a new method that uses other norms in the plane. This approach gives more conceptual proofs of some of their results, and as a consequence, we also obtain results on shortest directed networks for these norms."

By grouping homogeneous pixels, the accuracy can be increased and the decrease of the number of elements to process can drastically reduce the computational burden. For most superpixel methods, a trade-off is computed between 1) color homogeneity, 2) adherence to the image contours and 3) shape regularity of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a framework that jointly enforces all these aspects and provides accurate and regular Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP). During the decomposition, we propose to consider color features along the linear path between the pixel and the corresponding superpixel barycenter. A contour prior is also used to prevent the crossing of image boundaries when associating a pixel to a superpixel. Finally, in order to improve the decomposition accuracy and the robustness to noise, we propose to integrate the pixel neighborhood information, while preserving the same computational complexity. SCALP is extensively evaluated on standard segmentation dataset, and the obtained results outperform the ones of the state-of-the-art methods. SCALP is also extended for supervoxel decomposition on MRI images."

First, we introduce center points as the centers of the pseudo classes and the training samples can be allocated with pseudo labels based on the center points. Therefore, the CNN model, which is used to extract features from the scenes, can be trained supervised with the pseudo labels. Moreover, a pseudo-center loss is developed to decrease the variance between the samples and the corresponding pseudo center point. The pseudo-center loss is important since it can update both the center points with the training samples and the CNN model with the center points in the training process simultaneously. Finally, joint learning of the pseudo-center loss and the pseudo softmax loss which is formulated with the samples and the pseudo labels is developed for unsupervised remote sensing scene representation to obtain discriminative representations from the scenes. Experiments are conducted over two commonly used remote sensing scene datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method when compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

A categorified Hall algebra is an associative monoidal structure on the stable $\infty$-category $\mathsf{Coh}^{\mathsf{b}}(\mathbb{R}\mathcal{M})$ of complexes of sheaves with bounded coherent cohomology on a derived moduli stack $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{M}$. In the surface case, $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{M}$ is a suitable derived enhancement of the moduli stack $\mathcal M$ of coherent sheaves on the surface. This construction categorifies the K-theoretical and cohomological Hall algebras of coherent sheaves on a surface of Zhao and Kapranov-Vasserot. In the curve case, we define three categorified Hall algebras associated with suitable derived enhancements of the moduli stack of Higgs sheaves on a curve $X$, the moduli stack of vector bundles with flat connections on $X$, and the moduli stack of finite-dimensional local systems on $X$, respectively. In the Higgs sheaves case we obtain a categorification of the K-theoretical and cohomological Hall algebras of Higgs sheaves on a curve of Minets and Sala-Schiffmann, while in the other two cases our construction yields, by passing to $\mathsf K_0$, new K-theoretical Hall algebras, and by passing to $\mathsf H_\ast^{\mathsf{BM}}$, new cohomological Hall algebras. Finally, we show that the Riemann-Hilbert and the non-abelian Hodge correspondences can be lifted to the level of our categorified Hall algebras of a curve."

The solutions correspond to critical points of the underlying energy functional subject to the $L^2$-norm constraint. Our research covers several aspects. Firstly, in the mass subcritical case, we establish the compactness of any minimizing sequence to the associated global minimization problem. As a by-product of the compactness of any minimizing sequence, the orbital stability of the set of minimizers to the problem is achieved. In addition, we discuss the radial symmetry and uniqueness of minimizer to the problem. Secondly, in the mass critical case, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of normalized solution. Finally, in the mass supercritical case, we prove the existence of ground state and infinitely many radially symmetric solutions. Moreover, the instability of ground states is explored"

In this work we introduce an intuitive notion of diversity of a collection of solutions which suits a large variety of combinatorial problems of practical interest. We then present an algorithmic framework which---automatically---converts a tree-decomposition-based dynamic programming algorithm for a given combinatorial problem X into a dynamic programming algorithm for the diverse version of X. Surprisingly, our algorithm has a polynomial dependence on the diversity parameter. Going further, we devise a framework to translate kernels of a certain type for a given combinatorial problem X into kernels of a slightly larger size for its diverse version."

The influence of two parameters has been reported, the water conductivity (from 50 to 500 $\mu$S/cm) and the applied voltage (from 6 to 16 kV). Two complementary diagnostics, time resolved refractive index-based techniques and electrical measurements have been performed in order to study the discharge propagation and breakdown phenomena in water according to the two parameters. A single high voltage of duration between 100 $\mu$S and 1 ms is applied between two 100 $\mu$m diameter platinum tips separated by 2 mm and immersed in the aqueous solution. This work, which provides valuable complementary results of paper [1], is of great interest to better understand the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of pin-to-pin discharge in water. For low conductivity (from 50 to 100 $\mu$S/cm) results have confirmed two regimes of discharge (cathode and anode) and the increase of the applied voltage first makes the breakdown more achievable and then favors the apparition of the anode regime. For 500 $\mu$S/cm results have highlighted cathode regime for low applied voltage but a mixed regime (anode and cathode) for high applied voltage."

For the adjustment, two novel scene segmentation approaches based on luminance distribution are also proposed. Multi-exposure image fusion is a method for producing images that are expected to be more informative and perceptually appealing than any of the input ones, by directly fusing photos taken with different exposures. However, existing fusion methods often produce unclear fused images when input images do not have a sufficient number of different exposure levels. In this paper, we point out that adjusting the luminance of input images makes it possible to improve the quality of the final fused images. This insight is the basis of the proposed method. The proposed method enables us to produce high-quality images, even when undesirable inputs are given. Visual comparison results show that the proposed method can produce images that clearly represent a whole scene. In addition, multi-exposure image fusion with the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in terms of MEF-SSIM, discrete entropy, tone mapped image quality index, and statistical naturalness."

We considered the Otto geometry for SPPs excitation in graphene. Efficiency of SPPs excitation strongly depends on the SPPs propagation direction.

Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture using microbenchmarks.   The introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia's latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations. Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications. We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts.   We study the performance of the T4's TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing's instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions. We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive workloads that hit power or thermal limits.   Many of our findings are novel, published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software developers get closer to the GPU's peak performance."

These points have remarkable properties such as being robust topological monopoles of Berry curvature as well as an associated vanishing density of states. Here, we study the quantum optical consequences of such topological Weyl photons by characterizing the individual and collective dynamics of quantum emitters close to resonance with these points. Using an exact non-perturbative treatment, we predict the development of non-exponential decay dynamics due to the emergence of localized photonic states around the emitters. We find that these bound states, whose wavefunction displays power-law spatial decay, can mediate coherent and topological long-range interactions when many emitters exchange energy through Weyl photons. Furthermore, by exploiting the topological protection of Weyl points, we provide a recipe to tune the range of the mediated interactions while keeping their power-law nature, something not possible in any other photonic platform. Thus, Weyl photons enable coherent, tunable, long-range interactions between emitters, and therefore can become a very valuable platform in the context of quantum simulation."

If the orbit of c is not dense then most points in lim{[0,1],f} have neighborhoods that are homeomorphic with the product of a Cantor set and an open arc. The points without this property are called inhomogeneities, and the set, I, of inhomogeneities is equal to lim {{\omega}(c),f| {\omega}(c) }.   In this paper we consider the relationship between the limit complexity of {\omega}(c) and the limit complexity of I. We show that if {\omega}(c) is more complicated than a finite collection of convergent sequences then I can have arbitrarily high limit complexity. We give a complete description of the limit complexity of I for any possible {\omega}(c)."

The constitutive model is based on the mechanical behavior of sandwich beams, with the bending response split into membrane-induced and local bending modes. A micromechanical approach based on the structural analysis of a unit cell is derived and utilized to obtain the stiffness properties of selected prismatic cores. The model is shown to be equivalent to the classical thick-face sandwich theory for the same basic assumptions. A two-node finite element interpolated with linear and cubic shape functions is proposed and its stiffness and geometric stiffness matrices are derived. Three examples illustrate the model capabilities in predicting deflections, stresses and critical buckling loads of elastic sandwich beams including elastic size effects. Good agreement is obtained throughout in comparisons with more involved finite element models."

Although identifying and aggregating the individual reasons for each citation may be impractical, recording the number of citations that originate from different article sections might illuminate the general reasons behind a citation count (e.g., 110 citations = 10 Introduction citations + 100 Methods citations). To help investigate whether this could be a practical and universal solution, this article compares 19 million citations with DOIs from six different standard sections in 799,055 PubMed Central open access articles across 21 out of 22 fields. There are apparently non-systematic differences between fields in the most citing sections and the extent to which citations from one section overlap with citations from another, with some degree of overlap in most cases. Thus, at a science-wide level, section headings are partly unreliable indicators of citation context, even if they are more standard within individual fields. They may still be used within fields to help identify individual highly cited articles that have had one type of impact, especially methodological (Methods) or context setting (Introduction), but expert judgement is needed to validate the results."

Feedback from star formation drives outflows that carry mass and metals away from galaxies to the CGM, while infall from the intergalactic medium (IGM) is thought to bring in fresh gas to fuel star formation. Such exchanges of matter between IGM-CGM-galaxies have proven critical to producing galaxy scaling relations in cosmological simulations that match observations. However, the nature of these processes, of the physics that drives outflows and accretion, and their evolution with cosmic time are not fully characterized. One approach to constraining these processes is to characterize the metal enrichment of gas around and beyond galaxies. Measurements of the metallicity distribution functions of CGM/IGM gas over cosmic time provide independent tests of cosmological simulations. We have made great progress over the last decade as direct result of a very sensitive, high-resolution space-based UV spectrograph and the rise of ground-based spectroscopic archives. We argue the next transformative leap to track CGM/IGM metals during the epoch of galaxy formation and transformation into quiescent galaxies will require 1) a larger space telescope with an even more sensitive high-resolution spectrograph covering both the far- and near-UV (1,000-3,000 \AA); and 2) ground-based archives housing science-ready data."

The complexity of the ISD algorithm determines the minimum key size in these cryptosystems for a given security level. We show that using Lee metric codes can drastically decrease the key size, compared to Hamming metric codes. In the end we explain how our results can be generalized to other Galois rings $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$."

Both mechanisms have been widely studied. However, the literature has not shown measurements of the critical limits of the disk stability parameters (DSPs). We show measurements of those parameters through the whole evolution in isolated disk models and find that the initial rotation configuration of those models stays in the stable or unstable regime from the initial to the final evolution. Then we perturbed the isolated models to study the evolution of DSPs under perturbation. We find that the critical limits of DSPs are not much affected in barred models, but when the bar is triggered by a perturbation, the disk falls into the unstable regimen. We show in our models that a bar triggered by a light perturbation grows in two phases: first, the bar appears as a slow rotator, and then it evolves to be a fast rotator; second, when the perturbation is far from the target galaxy, the bar evolves from fast to slow rotator. When the bar is triggered by a heavy perturbation, it appears as a fast rotator and evolves to be a slow rotator, similar to classical bar models."

On one hand, pull-based engines can achieve higher throughput because their workloads are read-dominant, rather than write-dominant, and can proceed without synchronization between threads. On the other hand, push-based engines are much better able to take advantage of the frontier optimization, which leverages the fact that often only a small subset of the graph needs to be accessed to complete an iteration of a graph processing application. Hybrid engines attempt to overcome this trade-off by dynamically switching between push and pull, but there are two key disadvantages with this approach. First, applications must be implemented twice (once for push and once for pull), and second, processing throughput is reduced for iterations that run with push.   We propose a radically different solution: rebuild the frontier optimization entirely such that it is well-suited for a pull-based engine. In doing so, we remove the only advantage that a push-based engine had over a pull-based engine, making it possible to eliminate the push-based engine entirely. We introduce Wedge, a pull-only graph processing framework that transforms the traditional source-oriented vertex-based frontier into a pull-friendly format called the Wedge Frontier. The transformation itself is expensive even when parallelized, so we introduce two key optimizations to make it practical. First, we perform the transformation only when the resulting Wedge Frontier is sufficiently sparse. Second, we coarsen the granularity of the representation of elements in the Wedge Frontier. These optimizations respectively improve Wedge's performance by up to 5x and 2x, enabling it to outperform Grazelle, Ligra, and GraphMat respectively by up to 2.8x, 4.9x, and 185.5x."

The major issue of processing such variational B-rep models (in the STEP format) is that free motions of a well-constrained model involve more than just rigid-body motions. The fundamental difficulty lies in having a systematic description of what pattern these free motions follow. This paper proposes a geometric perturbation method to study these free motions. This method is a generalization of the witness method, allowing it to directly deal with variational B-rep models represented with the standard STEP scheme. This generalization is essentially achieved by using a direct, geometric representation of the free motions, and then expressing the free motions in terms of composites of several basis motions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparisons and case studies are presented."

Prior work has shown that an attacker-defender bi-level linear program (ADBLP) can be used to determine the worst-case consequences of FDI attacks aiming to maximize the physical power flow on a target line. Understanding the consequences of these attacks requires consideration of power system operations commonly used in practice, specifically real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED). An ADBLP is formulated with detailed assumptions on attacker's knowledge, and a modified Benders' decomposition algorithm is introduced to solve such an ADBLP. The vulnerability analysis results presented for the synthetic Texas system with 2000 buses show that intelligent FDI attacks can cause post-contingency overflows."

However, in most cases, obtaining demonstration data is costly and laborious, which poses a significant challenge in some scenarios. A promising alternative is to train agent learning skills via imitation learning without expert demonstrations, which, to some extent, would extremely expand imitation learning areas. To achieve such expectation, in this paper, we propose Hindsight Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (HGAIL) algorithm, with the aim of achieving imitation learning satisfying no need of demonstrations. Combining hindsight idea with the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) framework, we realize implementing imitation learning successfully in cases of expert demonstration data are not available. Experiments show that the proposed method can train policies showing comparable performance to current imitation learning methods. Further more, HGAIL essentially endows curriculum learning mechanism which is critical for learning policies."

In the case of an infinite speed of propagation of the interface, the asymptotic behavior of the local solution is classified at infinity. A full classification of the short-time behavior of the interface function and the local solution near the interface for the slow diffusion case ($mp>1$) was presented in $\textit{Abdulla et al., Math.

We describe two methods taking a step in this direction and present their results obtained during the n2c2 challenge on cohort selection for clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The first method is a weakly supervised method using an unlabeled corpus (MIMIC) to build a silver standard, by producing semi-automatically a small and very precise set of rules to detect some samples of positive and negative patients. This silver standard is then used to train a traditional supervised model. The second method is a terminology-based approach where a medical expert selects the appropriate concepts, and a procedure is defined to search the terms and check the structural or temporal constraints. Results: On the n2c2 dataset containing annotated data about 13 selection criteria on 288 patients, we obtained an overall F1-measure of 0.8969, which is the third best result out of 45 participant teams, with no statistically significant difference with the best-ranked team. Discussion: Both approaches obtained very encouraging results and apply to different types of criteria. The weakly supervised method requires explicit descriptions of positive and negative examples in some reports. The terminology-based method is very efficient when medical concepts carry most of the relevant information. Conclusion: It is unlikely that much more annotated data will be soon available for the task of identifying a wide range of patient phenotypes. One must focus on weakly or non-supervised learning methods using both structured and unstructured data and relying on a comprehensive representation of the patients."

Given a control system and its quotient we study under what conditions stabilizability of the quotient is sufficient to guarantee stabilizability of the original system. We develop a novel method of constructing a control Lyapunov function for the original system from the implied Lyapunov function of the quotient system, this construction involves the solution of a system of partial differential equations. By studying the integrability conditions of this associated system of partial differential equations we are able to characterize obstructions to our proposed method of constructing control Lyapunov functions in terms of the structure of the original control system."

In this work we apply these advances to video compression.   We propose a compression method that uses a saliency model to adaptively compress frame areas in accordance with their predicted saliency. We selected three state-of-the-art saliency models, adapted them for video compression and analyzed their results. The analysis includes objective evaluation of the models as well as objective and subjective evaluation of the compressed videos.   Our method, which is based on the x264 video codec, can produce videos with the same visual quality as regular x264, but it reduces the bitrate by 25% according to the objective evaluation and by 17% according to the subjective one. Also, both the subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that saliency models can compete with gaze maps for a single observer.   Our method can extend to most video bitstream formats and can improve video compression quality without requiring a switch to a new video encoding standard."

As a result, we construct a twistorial infinite spin field and derive its helicity decomposition. Using the field twistor transform, we construct the space-time infinite (continuous) spin field, which depends on the coordinate four-vector and additional commuting Weyl spinor. The equations of motion for infinite spin fields in the cases of integer and half-integer helicities are derived. We show that the infinite integer-spin field and infinite half-integer-spin field form the $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ infinite spin supermultiplet. The corresponding supersymmetry transformations are formulated and their on-shell algebra is derived. As a result, we find the field realization of the infinite spin $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ supersymmetry."

By introducing gaps into convolutional filters, they enable the use of larger receptive fields without increasing the original kernel size. Even though this allows for the inexpensive capturing of features at different scales, the structure of the dilated convolutional filter leads to a loss of information. We hypothesise that inexpensive modifications to Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks, such as additional averaging layers, could overcome this limitation. In this project we test this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of these modifications for a state-of-the art image segmentation system and compare them to existing approaches with the same objective. Our experiments show that our proposed methods improve the performance of dilated convolutions for image segmentation. Crucially, our modifications achieve these results at a much lower computational cost than previous smoothing approaches."

The implemented robust ensemble-based evolutionary calibration (REBEC) approach was compared to the baseline SPEA2 algorithm in a set of experiments with the SWAN wind wave model configuration for the Kara Sea domain.

It is shown that cosmological reionization of neutral Li atoms quickly completes as soon as the first star is formed. Since almost all Li is singly ionized during the main course of structure formation, it can efficiently separate from gravitationally collapsing neutral gas. The separation is more efficient in smaller structures which formed earlier. In the framework of the hierarchical structure formation, extremely metal-poor stars can have smaller Li abundances because of their earlier formations. It is found that the chemical separation by a magnetic field thus provides a reason that Li abundances in extremely metal-poor stars are lower than the Spite plateau and have a large dispersion as well as an explanation of the Spite plateau itself. In addition, the chemical separation scenario can explain Li abundances in NGC 6397 which are higher than the Spite plateau. Thus, Li abundances in metal-poor stars possibly keep information on the primordial magnetic field and the structure formation history."

We address the twin questions of how boundary geometry impacts flow profiles, and how one can engineer boundary conditions -- in particular the effective slip parameter -- to manipulate the flow in a controlled way. We first propose a micropatterned geometry involving finned barriers, for which we show by an explicit solution that one can obtain effectively no-slip boundary conditions regardless of the detailed microscopic nature of the channel surface. Next we analyse the role of mesoscopic boundary curvature on the effective slip length, in particular its impact on the Gurzhi effect. Finally we investigate a hydrodynamic flow through a circular junction, providing a solution, which suggests an experimental set-up for determining the slip parameter. We find that its transport properties differ qualitatively from the case of ballistic conduction, and thus presents a promising setting for distinguishing the two."

We examine the scaling behavior of X-ray temperatures, $T_X$, with optical richness, $\lambda_{RM}$, for clusters in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.7$. X-ray temperatures are obtained from Chandra and XMM observations for 58 and 110 redMaPPer systems, respectively. Despite non-uniform sky coverage, the $T_X$ measurements are $> 50\%$ complete for clusters with $\lambda_{RM} > 130$. Regression analysis on the two samples produces consistent posterior scaling parameters, from which we derive a combined constraint on the residual scatter, $\sigma_{\ln Tx | \lambda} = 0.275 \pm 0.019$. Joined with constraints for $T_X$ scaling with halo mass from the Weighing the Giants program and richness--temperature covariance estimates from the LoCuSS sample, we derive the richness-conditioned scatter in mass, $\sigma_{\ln M | \lambda} = 0.30 \pm 0.04\, _{({\rm stat})} \pm 0.09\, _{({\rm sys})}$, at an optical richness of approximately 70. Uncertainties in external parameters, particularly the slope and variance of the $T_X$--mass relation and the covariance of $T_X$ and $\lambda_{RM}$ at fixed mass, dominate the systematic error. The $95\%$ confidence region from joint sample analysis is relatively broad, $\sigma_{\ln M | \lambda} \in [0.14, \, 0.55]$, or a factor ten in variance."

It has been shown that under these assumptions, OCDM becomes an optimal waveform in terms of performance, i.e., frame error rate (FER), when employing a receiver capable of achieving perfect feedback equalizer (PFE) performance. Thus, this work targets proposing such a receiver for OCDM with low-complexity. Our approach is based on the well accepted minimum mean squared error with parallel interference cancellation (MMSE-PIC), where we derive an approximated equalizer whose complexity is reduced to two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) per iteration. The FER results reveal that i) the proposed low-complexity receiver perform as good as the original MMSE-PIC, ii) OCDM performs very closely to PFE, and iii) OCDM has approximately 2.5 dB improvement over OFDM."

As a first application of the method, we perform a calculation of the rate in $^4$He in a dynamical framework based on realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions and realistic nuclear charge-changing weak currents. The currents include one- and two-body terms induced by $\pi$- and $\rho$-meson exchange, and $N$-to-$\Delta$ excitation, and are constrained to reproduce the empirical value of the Gamow-Teller matrix element in tritium. We investigate the sensitivity of theoretical predictions to current parametrizations of the nucleon axial and induced pseudoscalar form factors as well as to two-body contributions in the weak currents. The large uncertainties in the measured values obtained from bubble-chamber experiments (carried out over 50 years ago) prevent us from drawing any definite conclusions."

In addition to mild assumptions on the distribution of the jumps for the driving process, the hypotheses for our main result are that the corresponding control system is dissipative, approximately controllable and solidly controllable. The solid controllability assumption is weaker than the well-known parabolic H\""ormander condition and is only required from a single point to which the system is approximately controllable.

Results: Mean diffusivities (MDs) extracted from INDI were comparable with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and the two-shot IDE in the water phantom. As expected in the brain tissues, DTI provided lower MD than UF-IDE and IDE, but IDE and UF-IDE were in excellent agreement. Simulations are presented for identifying the regimes where INDI is most beneficial. Conclusions: INDI accelerates dMRI acquisition to single-shot mode, which can be of great importance for mapping dynamic microstructural properties in-vivo without T2 bias."

RIS is envisioned to offer unprecedented spectral efficiency gains by utilizing $N$ passive reflecting elements that induce phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves to smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment. We study the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by the optimal linear precoder (OLP), that maximizes the minimum SINR subject to a given power constraint for any given RIS phase matrix, for the cases where the LoS channel matrix between the BS and the RIS is of rank-one and of full-rank. In the former scenario, the minimum SINR achieved by the RIS-assisted link is bounded by a quantity that goes to zero with $K$. For the high-rank scenario, we develop accurate deterministic approximations for the parameters of the asymptotically OLP, which are then utilized to optimize the RIS phase matrix. Simulation results show that RISs can outperform half-duplex relays with a small number of passive reflecting elements while large RISs are needed to outperform full-duplex relays."

The dispersion measure is a convolution of the cosmic distance element and the electron density, and contains the possibility of using these events as new cosmological distance measures. We explore the challenges of extracting the distance in a robust manner, and give quantitative estimates for the systematics control needed for fast radio bursts to become a competitive distance probe.

To maintain these near-perfect surfaces, recent research has focused on fabricating contacts that limit Fermi-level pinning at the metal-semiconductor interface. Here, we develop a new, simple procedure for transferring metal contacts that does not require aligned lithography. Using this technique, we fabricate vertical Schottky-junction $WS_2$ solar cells with Ag and Au as asymmetric work function contacts. Under laser illumination, we observe rectifying behavior and open-circuit voltage above 500 mV in devices with transferred contacts, in contrast to resistive behavior and open-circuit voltage below 15 mV in devices with evaporated contacts. One-sun measurements and device simulation results indicate that this metal transfer process could enable high-specific-power vertical Schottky-junction transition metal dichalcogenide photovoltaics, and we anticipate that this technique will lead to advances for two-dimensional devices more broadly."

Core levels and Auger transitions of the alloys except the invar alloy (x=0.4) exhibit no observable temperature induced changes. The invar alloy exhibits changes in the core levels below 20 K temperature that strongly depend on the core level. Such core level dependent changes with temperature were attributed to the precipitation of spin glass like phase below 20 K only in the invar alloy. Ni L$_3$M$_{45}$M$_{45}$ Auger transition also supported such precipitation below 20 K."

Although the study of PD is attracting the interest of many researchers around the world, databases to evaluate handwriting patterns are scarce and knowledge about patterns associated to PD is limited and biased to the existing datasets. This paper introduces a database with a total of 935 handwriting tasks collected from 55 PD patients and 94 healthy controls (45 young and 49 old). Three feature sets are extracted from the signals: neuromotor, kinematic, and nonlinear dynamic. Different classifiers are used to discriminate between PD and healthy subjects: support vector machines, knearest neighbors, and a multilayer perceptron. The proposed features and classifiers enable to detect PD with accuracies between 81% and 97%. Additionally, new insights are presented on the utility of the studied features for monitoring and detecting PD."

The zero field resistivity of x=0.1 and 0.9 alloys, predominant contribution to resistivity above near room temperature is due to electron-phonon scattering, whereas for x=05 and 0.7 alloys electron-magnon scattering is dominant. Alloys with x=0.1 and 0.9 exhibit positive magnetoresistance(MR) from 5K to 300K. For x=0.5 and 0.7 alloys, magnetoresistance changes sign from positive to negative with increase in temperature. The temperature at which sign changes increase with Ni concentration in the alloy. The field dependent magnetoresistance is positive for x=0.1, 0.7 and 0.9 alloys whereas it is negative for x=0.5 alloy. MR follows linear behaviour with field for x=0.1 alloy. MR of all other alloys follow a second order polynomial in field."

Algorithmic phase transitions in these problems have been shown to have broad connections ranging from mixing of Markov chains to information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistics. We consider the problem of counting $k$-cliques in $s$-uniform Erdos-Renyi hypergraphs $G(n,c,s)$ with edge density $c$, and show that its fine-grained average-case complexity can be based on its worst-case complexity. We prove the following:   1. Dense Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: Counting $k$-cliques on $G(n,c,s)$ with $k$ and $c$ constant matches its worst-case complexity up to a $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor. Assuming ETH, it takes $n^{\Omega(k)}$ time to count $k$-cliques in $G(n,c,s)$ if $k$ and $c$ are constant.   2. Sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: When $c = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, our reduction yields different average-case phase diagrams depicting a tradeoff between runtime and $k$ for each fixed $\alpha$. Assuming the best known worst-case algorithms are optimal, in the graph case of $s = 2$, we establish that the exponent in $n$ of the optimal running time for $k$-clique counting in $G(n,c,s)$ is $\frac{\omega k}{3} - C \alpha \binom{k}{2} + O_{k,\alpha}(1)$, where $\frac{\omega}{9} \le C \le 1$ and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant. In the hypergraph case of $s \ge 3$, we show a lower bound at the exponent of $k - \alpha \binom{k}{s} + O_{k,\alpha}(1)$, which surprisingly is tight exactly for the set of $c$ above the Erdos-Renyi $k$-clique percolation threshold.   Our reduction yields the first known average-case hardness result on Erdos-Renyi hypergraphs based on worst-case hardness conjectures. We also analyze algorithms for counting $k$-cliques in $G(n,c,s)$ to prove our upper bounds in the sparse case $c = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$."

Our calculation here, however, is unconditional and illustrates the advantage of the new setup for topological cyclic homology by Nikolaus-Scholze, which is used throughout. The only input necessary for our calculation is the evaluation by the Buenos Aires Cyclic Homology group and by Larsen of the structure of Hochschild complex of the coordinate ring as a mixed complex, that is, as an object of the infinity category of chain complexes with circle action."

Many authors have worked on proposals to extract those data back since this has many interesting applications. In this article, we summarise and compare many of the proposals to extract data from tables that are encoded using HTML and have been published between $2000$ and $2018$. We first present a vocabulary that homogenises the terminology used in this field; next, we use it to summarise the proposals; finally, we compare them side by side. Our analysis highlights several challenges to which no proposal provides a conclusive solution and a few more that have not been addressed sufficiently; simply put, no proposal provides a complete solution to the problem, which seems to suggest that this research field shall keep active in the near future. We have also realised that there is no consensus regarding the datasets and the methods used to evaluate the proposals, which hampers comparing the experimental results."

Local well-posedness and global well-posedness of solutions are established in the class of critical mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces. Being in the mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces, both of the initial data and the solutions could be singular at certain points or decaying to zero at infinity with different rates in different spatial variable directions. Some of these singular rates could be very strong and some of the decaying rates could be significantly slow. Besides other interests, the results of the paper particularly show an interesting phenomena on the persistence of the anisotropic behavior of the initial data under the evolution. To achieve the goals, fundamental analysis theory such as Young's inequality, time decaying of solutions for heat equations, the boundedness of the Helmholtz-Leray projection, and the boundedness of the Riesz tranfroms are developed in mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces. These fundamental analysis results are independently topics of great interests and they are potentially useful in other problems."

One practice is to acquire X-ray images in real-time during treatment, that are used to estimate the tumor location. These informations are used to predict the close future tumor trajectory. Kalman prediction is a classical approach for this task. The main drawback of X-ray acquisition is that it irradiates the patient, including its healthy tissues. In the classical Kalman framework, X-ray measurements are taken regularly, i.e. at a constant rate. In this paper, we propose a new approach which relaxes this constraint in order to take measurements when they are the most useful. Our aim is for a given budget of measurements to optimize the tracking process. This idea naturally brings to an optimal intermittent Kalman predictor for which measurement times are selected to minimize the mean squared prediction error over the complete fraction. This optimization problem can be solved directly when the respiratory model has been identified and the optimal sampling times can be computed at once. These optimal measurement times are obtained by solving a combinatorial optimization problem using a genetic algorithm. We created a test benchmark on trajectories validated on one patient. This new prediction method is compared to the regular Kalman predictor and a relative improvement of 9:8% is observed on the root mean square position estimation error."

The stellar mass growth history of Milky Way-mass progenitor SFGs is inferred from the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR)$-$stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) relation, and the gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$) is derived using the recently established gas scaling relations. With the $M_{\ast}+M_{\rm gas}$ growth curve, the net inflow rate $\kappa$ is quantified at each cosmic epoch. At $z\sim 1.3$, $\kappa$ is comparable with the SFR, whereas it rapidly decreases to $\sim 0.15\times$SFR at $z=0$. We then constrain the average outflow rate $\zeta_{\rm outflow}$ of progenitor galaxies by modeling the evolution of their gas-phase metallicity. The best-fit $\zeta_{\rm outflow}$ is found to be $(0.5-0.8)\times$SFR. Combining $\kappa$ and $\zeta_{\rm outflow}$, we finally investigate the evolution of $\zeta_{\rm inflow}$ since $z=1.3$. We find that $\zeta_{\rm inflow}$ rapidly decreases by $\sim$80\% from $z=1.3$ to $z=0.5$. At $z<0.5$, $\zeta_{\rm inflow}$ continuously decreases but with a much lower decreasing rate. Implications of these findings on galaxy evolution are discussed."

Among possible relaxations of a fixed model, the one defined by contamination neighbourhoods, namely, $\mathcal{V}_\alpha(P_0)=\{(1-\alpha)P_0+\alpha Q: Q \in \mathcal{P}\}$, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of all probabilities in the sample space, has received much attention, from its central role in Robust Statistics. For probabilities on the real line, consistent tests of fit to $\mathcal{V}_\alpha(P_0)$ can be based on $d_K(P_0,R_\alpha(P))$, the minimal Kolmogorov distance between $P_0$ and the set of trimmings of $P$, $R_\alpha(P)=\big\{\tilde P\in\mathcal{P}:\tilde P\ll P,\,{\textstyle \frac{d\tilde P}{dP}\leq\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}\, P\text{-a.s.}\big\}$. We show that this functional admits equivalent formulations in terms of, either best approximation in uniform norm by $L$-Lipschitz functions satisfying a box constraint, or as the best monotone approximation in uniform norm to the $L$-Lipschitz regularization, which is seen to be expressable in terms of the average of the Pasch-Hausdorff envelopes. This representation for the solution of the variational problem allows to obtain results showing stability of the functional $d_K(P_0,R_\alpha(P))$, as well as directional differentiability, providing the basis for a Central Limit Theorem for that functional."

The associated deterministic system of this stochastic differential equation (SDE) exhibits a periodic orbit and a slow manifold. The deterministic slow manifold can be viewed as an approximate parameterization of the fast variable of the SDE in terms of the slow variables. In other words the fast variable of the slow-fast system is approximately ""slaved"" to the slow variables via the slow manifold. We exploit this fact to obtain a two dimensional reduced model for the original stochastic system, which results in the Hopf-normal form with additive noise. Both, the original as well as the reduced system admit ergodic invariant measures describing their respective long-time behaviour. We will show that for a suitable metric on a subset of the space of all probability measures on phase space, the discrepancy between the marginals along the radial component of both invariant measures can be upper bounded by a constant and a quantity describing the quality of the parameterization. An important technical tool we use to arrive at this result is Girsanov's theorem, which allows us to modify the SDEs in question in a way that preserves transition probabilities. This approach is then also applied to reduced systems obtained through stochastic parameterizing manifolds, which can be viewed as generalized notions of deterministic slow manifolds."

In neuromorphic computing, the learning ability is embodied in specific changes of the synaptic weight. In this perspective, the relevant parameter is the conductance of the molecular spin valve, which plays the role of the synaptic weight. In this work we demonstrated that the conductance can be changes by the repeated application of voltage pulses. We studied the parameter space of the pulses in order to determine the most effective voltage and duration of the pulses. The conductance could also be modified by aligning the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic electrodes parallel or anti parallel to each other. This phenomenon, known as magnetoresistance, affects high conductance devices while leaving low conductance devices unaffected. We studied how this weight update rule affected the speed of reward-based learning in an actor-critic framework, compared to a linear update rule. This nonlinear update performed significantly better (50 learning trials; Epochs to reach a performance goal of 0.975 was 896+/-301 in the nonlinear case and 1076+/-484 in the nonlinear case; Welch t-test: p<0.05).

Motivated by the need that robot teams have in many real-world applications of remaining operational for long periods of time, we allow each robot to choose tasks taking into account the energy consumed by executing them, besides the global specifications on the task allocation. The tasks are encoded as constraints in an energy minimization problem solved at each point in time by each robot. The prioritization of a task over others -- effectively signifying the allocation of the task to that particular robot -- occurs via the introduction of slack variables in the task constraints. Moreover, the suitabilities of certain robots towards certain tasks are also taken into account to generate a task allocation algorithm for a team of robots with heterogeneous capabilities. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated both in simulation and on a team of real robots."

We focused on several well-characterized PWNe and used them as examples for introducing the concept of superefficiency. The latter is a period of the PWN evolution, happening within reverberation, where the luminosity in a given band exceeds the spin-down power at the time. Here, we explore a broad range of PWN models to study their reverberation and superefficiency phases in a systematic way. Armed with these models we consider two aspects: On the one hand, we analyze via Monte Carlo simulations how many Galactic PWNe are expected to be reverberating or in a superefficiency stage at any given time, providing the first such estimations. On the other hand, we focus on searching for observational signatures of such periods. We analyze archival observations and check for the existence of possible candidates for superefficient PWNe. We also provide predictions for the future evolution of the magnetar nebula J1834.9-0846 (which we consider to be starting its reverberation period) along the next 50 years.

Its mission is to evoke discovery of multimessenger astrophysical sources, exploit these sources for purposes of astrophysics and fundamental physics, and explore multimessenger datasets for evidence of multimessenger source population AMON aims to promote the advancement of multimessenger astrophysics by allowing its participants to study the most energetic phenomena in the universe and to help answer some of the outstanding enigmas in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The main strength of AMON is its ability to combine and analyze sub-threshold data from different facilities. Such data cannot generally be used stand-alone to identify astrophysical sources. The analyses algorithms used by AMON can identify statistically significant coincidence candidates of multimessenger events, leading to the distribution of AMON alerts used by partner observatories for real-time follow-up that may identify and, potentially, confirm the reality of the multimessenger association. We present the science motivation, partner observatories, implementation and summary of the current status of the AMON project."

In particular, after taking the logarithm it is asymptotically upper bounded by $g$ for $g>1$. The construction of a cohomology theory for arithmetic surfaces in Arakelov theory has long been an open problem. In particular, it is not known if $h^{1}(X,L)\ge 0$. We view this as an indirect piece of evidence that if such a cohomology theory exists, the $h^{1}$ term may be effectively estimated."

This paper incorporates the choice of service windows into a queueing model with a floor represented by discrete cells. We contrived a logit-based choice algorithm for agents considering the numbers of agents and the distances to all service windows. Simulations were conducted with various parameters of agent choice preference for these two elements and for different floor configurations, including the floor length and the number of service windows. We investigated the model from the viewpoint of transit times and entrance block rates. The influences of the parameters on these factors were surveyed in detail and we determined that there are optimum floor lengths that minimize the transit times. In addition, we observed that the transit times were determined almost entirely by the entrance block rates. The results of the presented model are relevant to understanding queueing systems including the choice of service windows and can be employed to optimize facility design and floor management."

The virtual Euler characteristics of Quot schemes of surfaces, a new theory parallel to the Vafa-Witten Euler characteristics of the moduli of bundles, is defined and studied. Complete formulas for the virtual Euler characteristics are found in the case of dimension 0 quotients on surfaces. Dimension 1 quotients are studied on K3 surfaces and surfaces of general type with connections to the Kawai-Yoshioka formula and the Seiberg-Witten invariants respectively.

In this paper, we study batch and parallel algorithms for the dynamic connectivity problem, a fundamental problem that has received considerable attention in sequential setting. Perhaps the best known sequential algorithm is the elegant level-set algorithm of Holm, de Lichtenberg and Thorup (HDT), which achieves $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized time per edge insertion or deletion, and $O(\log n)$ time per query.   In this paper, we design a parallel batch-dynamic connectivity algorithm that is work-efficient with respect to the HDT algorithm for small batch sizes, and is asymptotically faster when the average batch size is sufficiently large. Given a sequence of batched updates, where $\Delta$ is the average batch size of all deletions, our algorithm achieves $O(\log n \log(1 + n / \Delta))$ expected amortized work per edge insertion and deletion and $O(\log^3 n)$ depth w.h.p. Our algorithm answers a batch of $k$ connectivity queries in $O(k \log(1 + n/k))$ expected work and $O(\log n)$ depth w.h.p. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for connectivity."

It exhibits a unique herringbone dimerization pattern with a largest ever reported value of the bond shrinkage of about ~ 0.5 \r{A}. Despite extensive studies, both theoretical and experimental, however, its origin and its effect on physical properties still remain to be understood. In this work, using high quality single crystals we investigated the anisotropy of resistivity ($\rho$) and magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) to find a very clear anisotropy: $\rho$$_c*$ > $\rho$$_b$ > $\rho$$_a$ and $\chi$$_b$ > $\chi$$_a$ > $\chi$$_c*$. For possible theoretical interpretations, we carried out density functional calculations to conclude that these anisotropic behavior is due to the correlation effects combined with the unique orbital structure and the dimerization of Ru 4d bands."

This temporal interval in solar system evolution, termed late accretion, thermally and chemically modified solid planetary surfaces and may have impeded the emergence of life on the Hadean Earth. The sources and tempo of late accretion are, however, vague. Here, we present a timeline that relates variably retentive radiometric ages from asteroidal meteorites, to new dynamical models of late accretion that invokes giant planet migration. Reconciliation of the geochronological data with dynamical models shows that giant planet migration immediately leads to an intense 30 Myr influx of comets to the entire solar system. The absence of whole-sale crustal reset ages after 4450 Ma for the most resilient chronometers from Earth, Moon, Mars, Vesta and various meteorite parent bodies confines the onset of giant planet migration to no later than ca. 4480 Ma. Waning impacts from planetesimals, asteroids (and a minor cometary component) continue to strike the inner planets through a protracted monotonic decline in impactor flux; this is in agreement with predictions from crater chronology. Amended global 3-D thermal analytical bombardment models derived from our new impact mass-production functions show that persistent niches for prebiotic chemistry on the early Hadean Earth could endure late accretion for at least the last 4400 Myr."

Here, we report that high-quality monolayer boron nitride (BN) has a thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of 751 W/mK at room temperature. Though smaller than that of graphene, this value is larger than that of cubic boron nitride (cBN) and only second to those of diamond and lately discovered cubic boron arsenide (BAs). Monolayer BN has the second largest \k{appa} per unit weight among all semiconductors and insulators, just behind diamond, if density is considered. The \k{appa} of atomically thin BN decreases with increased thickness. Our large-scale molecular dynamic simulations using Green-Kubo formalism accurately reproduce this trend, and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the main scattering mechanism. The thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of monolayer to trilayer BN at 300-400 K are also experimentally measured, and the results are comparable to atomistic ab initio DFT calculations in a wider range of temperatures. Thanks to its wide bandgap, high thermal conductivity, outstanding strength, good flexibility, and excellent thermal and chemical stability, atomically thin BN is a strong candidate for heat dissipation applications, especially in the next generation of flexible electronic devices."

During the magnetic-field pulse, $f_0$ and $Q$ of the QCM are simultaneously measured by a ringdown technique. The typical resolution of $(\rho\eta)^{0.5}$ is 0.5 %.

This is an independent confirmation of the detection of millisecond pulsations from PSR J1023+0038 obtained with SiFAP at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We observed the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 with Aqueye+ mounted at the Copernicus telescope in January 2018. Highly significant pulsations were detected. The rotational period is in agreement with the value extrapolated from the X-ray ephemeris, while the time of passage at the ascending node is shifted by $11.55 \pm 0.08$ s from the value predicted using the orbital period from the X-rays. An independent optical timing solution is derived over a baseline of a few days, that has an accuracy of $\sim 0.007$ in pulse phase ($\sim 12$ $\mu$s in time). This level of precision is needed to derive an accurate coherent timing solution for the pulsar and to search for possible phase shifts between the optical and X-ray pulses using future simultaneous X-ray and optical observations."

It is shown that the kinetic effects related to higher-order momenta of the electron distribution function lead to coupling of Laguerre-Gaussian modes and result in modification of the wave dispersion and damping. The theoretical analysis is compared to the three-dimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations for a mode with orbital momentum l = 2. It is demonstrated that propagation of such a plasma wave is accompanied with generation of quasi-static axial and azimuthal magnetic fields which are consequence of the longitudinal and orbital momentum transported with the wave.

To efficiently address this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem we conduct an analysis of the structure of good quality solutions. This analysis shows that the No-Wait specificity gives them a common structure: they share identical sub-sequences of jobs, we call super-jobs. After a discussion on the way to identify these super-jobs, we propose IG-SJ, an algorithm that exploits super-jobs within the state-of-the-art algorithm for the classical permutation flowshop, the well-known Iterated Greedy (IG) algorithm. An iterative approach of IG-SJ is also proposed. Experiments are conducted on Taillard's instances. The experimental results show that exploiting super-jobs is successful since IG-SJ is able to find 64 new best solutions."

The NB964 filter was manufactured by Materion in 2015. It has a central wavelength of 964.2 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 9.2 nm. An NB964 survey named LAGER (Lyman Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization) has been ongoing since December 2015. Here we report results of lab tests, on-site tests and observations with the NB964 filter. The excellent performances of this filter ensure that the LAGER project is able to detect LAEs at z~7 with a high efficiency."

Here we build on the discovery by Mohr-Smith et al. (2017) of a large number of reddened O stars around this cluster. We construct a list of 288 candidate O stars with proper motions, in a region of sky spanning 1.5x1.5 square degrees centered on NGC 3603, by cross-matching the Mohr-Smith et al. (2017) catalogue with Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). This provides the basis for a first comprehensive examination of the proper motions of these massive stars in the halo of NGC 3603, relative to the much better studied central region. We identify up to 11 likely O star ejections -- 8 of which would have been ejected between 0.60 and 0.95 Myr ago (supporting the age of c.1 Myr that has been attributed to the bright cluster centre). Seven candidate ejections are arranged in a partial ring to the south of the cluster core spanning radii of 9-18 arcmin (18-36 pc if the cluster is 7 kpc away). We also show that the cluster has a halo of a further 100 O stars extending to a radius of at least 5 arcmin, adding to the picture of NGC 3603 as a scaled down version of the R136/30 Dor region."

However, without significant overlap between the observational footprints of deep and shallow galaxy surveys, the extent to which structural measurements for large galaxy samples are robust to image quality (e.g., depth, spatial resolution) cannot be established. Deep images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 co-adds provide a unique solution to this problem - offering $1.6-1.8$ magnitudes improvement in depth with respect to SDSS Legacy images. Having similar spatial resolution to Legacy, the co-adds make it possible to examine the sensitivity of parametric morphologies to depth alone. Using the Gim2D surface-brightness decomposition software, we provide public morphology catalogs for 16,908 galaxies in the Stripe 82 $ugriz$ co-adds. Our methods and selection are completely consistent with the Simard et al. (2011) and Mendel et al. (2014) photometric decompositions. We rigorously compare measurements in the deep and shallow images. We find no systematics in total magnitudes and sizes except for faint galaxies in the $u$-band and the brightest galaxies in each band. However, characterization of bulge-to-total fractions is significantly improved in the deep images. Furthermore, statistics used to determine whether single-S\'ersic or two-component (e.g., bulge+disc) models are required become more bimodal in the deep images. Lastly, we show that asymmetries are enhanced in the deep images and that the enhancement is positively correlated with the asymmetries measured in Legacy images."

Via the DDK ansatz, LQG can equivalently be described as the random geometry obtained by exponentiating $\gamma$ times a variant of the planar Gaussian free field (GFF), where $\gamma\in(0,2]$ satisfies $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}=25-6(2/\gamma+\gamma/2)^2$. Physics considerations suggest that LQG should also make sense in the regime when $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}>1$. However, the behavior in this regime is rather mysterious in part because the corresponding value of $\gamma$ is complex, so analytic continuations of various formulas give complex answers which are difficult to interpret in a probabilistic setting.   We introduce and study a discretization of LQG which makes sense for all values of $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(-\infty,25)$. Our discretization consists of a random planar map, defined as the adjacency graph of a tiling of the plane by dyadic squares which all have approximately the same ""LQG size"" with respect to the GFF. We prove that several formulas for dimension-related quantities are still valid for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$, with the caveat that the dimension is infinite when the formulas give a complex answer. In particular, we prove an extension of the (geometric) KPZ formula for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$, which gives a finite quantum dimension iff the Euclidean dimension is at most $(25-\mathbf c_{\mathrm M})/12$. We also show that the graph distance between typical points with respect to our discrete model grows polynomially whereas the cardinality of a graph distance ball of radius $r$ grows faster than any power of $r$ (which suggests that the Hausdorff dimension of LQG is infinite for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$).

We decompose the IR-to-radio spectral energy distribution (SED), sampled in 51 bands, using (i) a model comprised of two-temperature modified blackbodies (MBB) and radio power-laws and (ii) a semi-analytic model, which also accounts for emission from a clumpy torus. The latter is more realistic but requires a well-sampled SED, as possible here. In the former model, we find temperatures of T_warm = 296^17_15 K and T_cold = 110^3_3 K for the warm and cold dust components, respectively. This model suggests that the cold dust component dominates the FIR energy budget (66%) but contributes only 17% to the total IR luminosity. Based on the torus models, we infer an inclination angle of i=15^8_8 degree and the presence of silicate emission, in accordance with the Type-1 active galactic nucleus nature of APM 08279+5255. Accounting for the torus' contribution to the FIR luminosity, we find a lensing-corrected star formation rate of SFR=3075x(4/mu_L) Msun yr^-1. We find that the central quasar contributes 30% to the FIR luminosity but dominates the total IR luminosity (93%). The 30% correction is in contrast to the 90% reported in previous work. In addition, the IR luminosity inferred from the torus model is a factor of two higher. These differences highlight the importance of adopting physically motivated models to properly account for IR emission in high-z quasars, which is now possible with SOFIA/HAWC+."

Typically this understanding is achieved with RGBD cameras, but the evaluation process for selecting an appropriate RGBD camera for the application is minimally quantitative. Limited manufacturer-published metrics do not translate to observed quality in real-world cluttered environments, since quality is application-specific. To bridge the gap, we present a method for quantitatively measuring depth quality using a set of extendable 3D printed fixtures that approximate real-world conditions. By framing depth quality as point cloud density and root mean square error (RMSE) from a known geometry, we present a method that is extendable by other system integrators for custom environments. We show a comparison of 3 cameras and present a case study for camera selection, provide reference meshes and analysis code, and discuss further extensions."

We derived formulas for vacuum state vector and operators of the Lorentz transformations of spinors in the superalgebraic representation of spinors. Five operator analogs of five Dirac gamma matrices exist in the superalgebraic approach as well as two additional operator analogs of gamma matrices. Gamma operators are constructed from Grassmann densities and derivatives with respect to them. We have shown that there are operators which are built from creation and annihilation operators, and that they are also analogs of Dirac gamma matrices. However, unlike gamma operators of the first kind, they are Lorentz invariant. We have shown that the condition for the existence of spinor vacuum imposes restrictions on possible variants of Clifford algebras of gamma operators: only real algebra with one timelike basis Clifford vector corresponding to the zero gamma matrix in the Dirac representation can be realized. In this case, the signature of the four-dimensional spacetime, in which there is a vacuum state, can only be (1, -1, -1, -1), and there are two additional axes corresponding to the inner space of the spinor, with a signature (-1, -1)."

High-precision time-series photometric data assembled by recent space missions revealed that current models of stellar structure and evolution show major shortcomings already in the two earliest nuclear burning phases, impacting all subsequent phases prior to the formation of the end-of-life remnant. This white paper focuses specifically on the transport of chemical elements and of angular momentum in the stellar structure and evolution models of stars born with convective core, as revealed by their gravity-mode oscillations."

A timely question, given recent advances in the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials, is whether strong light-matter coupling can be used to invert the ordering of singlet and triplet states and, in addition, enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. Here, we demonstrate a complete inversion of the singlet lower polariton and triplet excited states. We also unambiguously measure the RISC rate in strongly-coupled organic microcavities and find that, regardless of the large energy level shifts, it is unchanged compared to films of the bare molecules. This observation is a consequence of slow RISC to the lower polariton due to the delocalized nature of the state across many molecules and an inability to compete with RISC to the dark exciton reservoir, which occurs at a rate comparable to that in bare molecules."

As an example of application, we analyze bike usage patterns on the Divvy bike sharing system of the city of Chicago."

ZTF18aalrxas was discovered while the optical emission was still rising towards the initial cooling peak (0.7 mag over 2 days). Our observations consist of multi-band (UV, optical) light-curves, and optical spectra spanning from $\approx0.7$ d to $\approx180$ d past the explosion. We use a Monte-Carlo based non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model, that simultanously reproduces both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ powered bolometric light curve and our nebular spectrum. This model is used to constrain the synthesized radioactive nickel mass (0.17 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and the total ejecta mass (1.7 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) of the SN. The cooling emission is modeled using semi-analytical extended envelope models to constrain the progenitor radius ($790-1050$ $\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion. Our nebular spectrum shows signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), and this spetrum is modeled and analysed to constrain the amount of ejected oxygen ($0.3-0.5$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and the total hydrogen mass ($\approx0.15$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) in the envelope of the progenitor. The oxygen mass of ZTF18aalrxas is consistent with a low ($12-13$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) Zero Age Main Sequence mass progenitor. The light curves and spectra of ZTF18aalrxas are not consistent with massive single star SN Type IIb progenitor models. The presence of an extended hydrogen envelope of low mass, the presence of a dense CSM, the derived ejecta mass, and the late-time oxygen emission can all be explained in a binary model scenario."

The detector setup is installed at the commercial nuclear power plant in Brokdorf, Germany, at a very small distance to the reactor core in order to guarantee a high flux of more than 10$^{13}\bar\nu$/(s$\cdot$cm$^2$). For the experiment, a good understanding of neutron-induced background events is required, as the neutron recoil signals can mimic the predicted neutrino interactions. Especially neutron-induced events correlated with the thermal power generation are troublesome for CONUS. On-site measurements revealed the presence of a thermal power correlated, highly thermalized neutron field with a fluence rate of (745$\pm$30)cm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$. These neutrons that are produced by nuclear fission inside the reactor core, are reduced by a factor of $\sim$10$^{20}$ on their way to the CONUS shield. With a high-purity Ge detector without shield the $\gamma$-ray background was examined including highly thermal power correlated $^{16}$N decay products as well as $\gamma$-lines from neutron capture. Using the measured neutron spectrum as input, it was shown, with the help of Monte Carlo simulations, that the thermal power correlated field is successfully mitigated by the installed CONUS shield. The reactor-induced background contribution in the region of interest is exceeded by the expected signal by at least one order of magnitude assuming a realistic ionization quenching factor of 0.2."

In 1979 Matveev and Satsuma, independently, obtained solutions in Wronskian form for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. Later, in 1981 these solutions were constructed from Sato's approach. Then in 1983, Freeman and Nimmo invented the so-called Wronskian technique, which allows directly verifying bilinear equations when their solutions are given in terms of Wronskians. In this technique the considered bilinear equation is usually reduced to the Pl\""ucker relation on Grassmannians, and finding solutions of the bilinear equation is transferred to find a Wronskian vector that is defined by a linear differential equation system. General solutions of such differential equation systems can be constructed by means of triangular Toeplitz matrices. In this monograph we review the Wronskian technique and solutions in Wronskian form, with supporting instructive examples, including the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the modified KdV equation, the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy and reductions, and the lattice potential KdV equation.

Apart from its clear relevance in situations where nonlocality is a resource, distillation protocols also play an important role in the understanding of information-theoretical principles for quantum theory. Here, we derive a necessary condition for nonlocality distillation from two copies and apply it, among other results, to show that $1$D and $2$D quantum voids --faces of the nonlocal simplex set with no quantum realization-- can be distilled up to PR-boxes. With that, we generalize previous results in the literature.

DQN is a general-purpose, model-free algorithm and has been proven to perform well in a variety of tasks including Atari 2600 games since it's first proposed by Minh et el. However, like many other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, DQN suffers from poor sample efficiency when rewards are sparse in an environment. As a result, most of the transitions stored in the replay memory have no informative reward signal, and provide limited value to the convergence and training of the Q-Network. However, one insight is that these transitions can be used to learn the dynamics of the environment as a supervised learning problem. The transitions also provide information of the distribution of visited states. Our algorithm utilizes these two observations to perform a one-step planning during exploration to pick an action that leads to states least likely to be seen, thus improving the performance of exploration. We demonstrate our agent's performance in two classic environments with sparse rewards in OpenAI gym: Mountain Car and Lunar Lander."

We propose the use of X-Ray navigation for pose estimation of periacetabular fragments without fiducials. Methods: A 2D/3D registration pipeline was developed to recover fragment pose. This pipeline was tested through an extensive simulation study and 6 cadaveric surgeries. Using osteotomy boundaries in the fluoroscopic images, the preoperative plan is refined to more accurately match the intraoperative shape. Results: In simulation, average fragment pose errors were 1.3{\deg}/1.7 mm when the planned fragment matched the intraoperative fragment, 2.2{\deg}/2.1 mm when the plan was not updated to match the true shape, and 1.9{\deg}/2.0 mm when the fragment shape was intraoperatively estimated. In cadaver experiments, the average pose errors were 2.2{\deg}/2.2 mm, 3.8{\deg}/2.5 mm, and 3.5{\deg}/2.2 mm when registering with the actual fragment shape, a preoperative plan, and an intraoperatively refined plan, respectively. Average errors of the lateral center edge angle were less than 2{\deg} for all fragment shapes in simulation and cadaver experiments. Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is capable of accurately reporting femoral head coverage within a range clinically identified for long-term joint survivability. Significance: Human interpretation of fragment pose is challenging and usually restricted to rotation about a single anatomical axis. The proposed pipeline provides an intraoperative estimate of rigid pose with respect to all anatomical axes, is compatible with minimally invasive incisions, and has no dependence on external fiducials."

However, as it restricts the partitions to be axis-aligned, its modelling flexibility is limited. In this work, we propose a self-consistent Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)-Tree process to generalize the Mondrian process. The BSP-Tree process is an almost surely right continuous Markov jump process that allows uniformly distributed oblique cuts in a two-dimensional convex polygon. The BSP-Tree process can also be extended using a non-uniform probability measure to generate direction differentiated cuts. The process is also self-consistent, maintaining distributional invariance under a restricted subdomain. We use Conditional-Sequential Monte Carlo for inference using the tree structure as the high-dimensional variable. The BSP-Tree process's performance on synthetic data partitioning and relational modelling demonstrates clear inferential improvements over the standard Mondrian process and other related methods."

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often critical to the generation and manipulation of skyrmions. However, there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the origin of DMI or the mechanism by which DMI generates skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. Very little is known of the material parameters that determine the value of DMI. This knowledge is vital for rational design of skyrmion materials and further development of skyrmion technology. To address this important problem, we investigate DMI in magnetic bilayers using first-principles. We present a new theoretical model that explains the microscopic origin of DMI in magnetic bilayers. We demonstrate that DMI depends on two parameters, interfacial hybridization and orbital contributions of the heavy metal. Using these parameters, we explain the trend of DMI observed. We also report four new materials systems with giant DMI and new designs for magnetic multilayers that are expected to outperform the best materials known so far. Our results present a notably new understanding of DMI, uncover highly promising materials and put forth novel pathways for the controlled generation of skyrmions."

Literature and practice have shown that commitment to SPI at all organizational levels is essential for the success of any SPI endeavor. A research model for studying the existence, development and interplay of SPI-related commitment is introduced in this paper. This study suggests that software organizations operate through strategic, operational and personal commitment nets. These nets consist of actors, drivers, concerns, actions, commitment, and outcomes. The commitment nets model is applied in a study of four industrial SPI initiatives. The results from two of these cases are reported here. The results show that SPI is driven through the formation and reformation of commitment nets. The contents of strategic, operational and personal commitment nets are laid out and implications are discussed."

To protect against denial-of-service attacks, QUIC servers need to validate the IP addresses claimed by their clients. So far, the QUIC protocol conducts address validation for each hostname separately using validation tokens. In this work, we review this practice and introduce a new QUIC transport parameter to allow a shared address validation across hostnames. This parameter indicates to the client, that an issued validation token can be used to abbreviate the address validation when connecting to specific other hostnames. Based on trust-relations between real-world hostnames we evaluate the performance benefits of our proposal. Our results suggest that a shared address validation saves a round-trip time on almost 60% of the required handshakes to different hosts during the first loading of an average website. Assuming a typical transatlantic connection with a round-trip time of 90ms.

Data scientists and computer engineers are making various efforts to provide definitions of fairness. In this paper, we provide an overview of the most widespread definitions of fairness in the field of machine learning, arguing that the ideas highlighting each formalization are closely related to different ideas of justice and to different interpretations of democracy embedded in our culture.

Event synchronization analysis was originally conceived with the aim of providing a simple and robust method to measure synchronization between two time series. In this paper we propose a novel method extending the state-of-the-art of the event synchronization techniques: the Multi-Event-Class Synchronization (MECS) algorithm. MECS measures the synchronization between relevant events belonging to different event classes that are detected in multiple time series. Its motivation emerged from the need to model non-verbal multimodal signals in Human-Computer Interaction. Using MECS, synchronization can be computed between events belonging to the same class (intra-class synchronization) or between events belonging to different classes (inter-class synchronization). In the paper we also show how our technique can deal with macro-events (i.e., sets of events satisfying constraints) and macro-classes (i.e., sets of classes). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed method to two types of data i) artificial and 2) real-world case study concerning analysis of human multimodal behavior."

In this study, we show that ghost cytometry can be used to classify cell populations of the same type but with different fluorescence distributions in space, supporting the strength of our image-free approach for morphologic cell analysis."

A luminous matter plunging into black hole from different directions provides the observational opportunity for recovering a total silhouette of the invisible event horizon globe. The event horizon silhouette is projected on the celestial sphere within a position of the black hole shadow.

This turns out to be a useful way to think of this construct. In particular, we extend some results of Shapiro regarding the largest odd numbers at a height. We present some theoretical and computational evidence to show that $H$ and its relatives are closely related to the important functions of number theory, namely $\pi(n)$ and the $n$th prime $p_n$.

The origin of the observed $\simeq 20\%$ polarization fractions can be identified by characterizing the properties of optical starlight polarization in a region with maximally polarized dust emission. We measure the R-band linear polarization of 22 stars in a region with a submillimeter polarization fraction of $\simeq 20%$. A subset of 6 stars is also measured in the B, V and I bands to investigate the wavelength dependence of polarization. We find that starlight is polarized at correspondingly high levels. Through multiband polarimetry we find that the high polarization fractions are unlikely to arise from unusual dust properties, such as enhanced grain alignment. Instead, a favorable magnetic field geometry is the most likely explanation, and is supported by observational probes of the magnetic field morphology. The observed starlight polarization exceeds the classical upper limit of $\left[p_V/E\left(B-V\right)\right]_{\rm max} = 9$%mag$^{-1}$ and is at least as high as 13%mag$^{-1}$ that was inferred from a joint analysis of Planck data, starlight polarization and reddening measurements.

However, one of the fatal drawbacks in such approaches is that they are unable to generate informative utterances, so it limits their usage from some real-world conversational applications. This paper attempts at generating diverse and informative responses with a variational generation model, which contains a joint attention mechanism conditioning on the information from both dialogue contexts and extra knowledge."

The capabilities of Twinkle, a space telescope in a low Earth orbit with a 0.45m mirror, to acquire spectroscopic data of Solar System targets in the visible and infrared are assessed. Twinkle is a general observatory that provides on demand observations of a wide variety of targets within wavelength ranges that are currently not accessible using other space telescopes or that are accessible only to oversubscribed observatories in the short-term future. We determine the periods for which numerous Solar System objects could be observed and find that Solar System objects are regularly observable. The photon flux of major bodies is determined for comparison to the sensitivity and saturation limits of Twinkle's instrumentation and we find that the satellite's capability varies across the three spectral bands (0.4-1, 1.3-2.42, and 2.42-4.5{\mu}m). We find that for a number of targets, including the outer planets, their large moons, and bright asteroids, the model created predicts that with short exposure times, high-resolution spectra (R~250, {\lambda} < 2.42{\mu}m; R~60, {\lambda} > 2.42{\mu}m) could be obtained with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of >100 with exposure times of <300s."

This is creating a new version of the digital divide: the artificial intelligence (AI) divide. Transfer-based approaches, such as Cross-Lingual Text Classification (CLTC) - the task of categorizing texts written in different languages into a common taxonomy, are a promising solution to the emerging AI divide. Recent work on CLTC has focused on demonstrating the benefits of using bilingual word embeddings as features, relegating the CLTC problem to a mere benchmark based on a simple averaged perceptron.   In this paper, we explore more extensively and systematically two flavors of the CLTC problem: news topic classification and textual churn intent detection (TCID) in social media. In particular, we test the hypothesis that embeddings with context are more effective, by multi-tasking the learning of multilingual word embeddings and text classification; we explore neural architectures for CLTC; and we move from bi- to multi-lingual word embeddings. For all architectures, types of word embeddings and datasets, we notice a consistent gain trend in favor of multilingual joint training, especially for low-resourced languages."

Recently, algorithms based on deep convolutional neural nets have shown great promise for automated nodule detection. Most of the existing deep learning nodule detection systems are constructed in two steps: a) nodule candidates screening and b) false positive reduction, using two different models trained separately. Although it is commonly adopted, the two-step approach not only imposes significant resource overhead on training two independent deep learning models, but also is sub-optimal because it prevents cross-talk between the two. In this work, we present an end-to-end framework for nodule detection, integrating nodule candidate screening and false positive reduction into one model, trained jointly. We demonstrate that the end-to-end system improves the performance by 3.88\% over the two-step approach, while at the same time reducing model complexity by one third and cutting inference time by 3.6 fold. Code will be made publicly available."

However, our understanding of how to represent the search space for neural net architectures and how to search that space efficiently are both still in their infancy.   We have performed an in-depth analysis to identify limitations in a widely used search space and a recent architecture search method, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). These findings led us to introduce novel network blocks with a more general, balanced, and consistent design; a better-optimized Cosine Power Annealing learning rate schedule; and other improvements. Our resulting sharpDARTS search is 50% faster with a 20-30% relative improvement in final model error on CIFAR-10 when compared to DARTS. Our best single model run has 1.93% (1.98+/-0.07) validation error on CIFAR-10 and 5.5% error (5.8+/-0.3) on the recently released CIFAR-10.1 test set. To our knowledge, both are state of the art for models of similar size. This model also generalizes competitively to ImageNet at 25.1% top-1 (7.8% top-5) error.   We found improvements for existing search spaces but does DARTS generalize to new domains? We propose Differentiable Hyperparameter Grid Search and the HyperCuboid search space, which are representations designed to leverage DARTS for more general parameter optimization. Here we find that DARTS fails to generalize when compared against a human's one shot choice of models. We look back to the DARTS and sharpDARTS search spaces to understand why, and an ablation study reveals an unusual generalization gap. We finally propose Max-W regularization to solve this problem, which proves significantly better than the handmade design. Code will be made available."

Assuming that disintegration and regeneration reactions involving light nuclei proceed in relative chemical equilibrium after the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, their abundances are determined through the famous cosmological Saha equation of primordial nucleosynthesis and show no exponential dependence on the temperature typical for the thermal model. A quantitative analysis, performed using the hadron resonance gas model in partial chemical equilibrium, shows agreement with experimental data of the ALICE collaboration on d, $^3$He, $^3_\Lambda$H, and $^4$He yields for a very broad range of temperatures at $T \lesssim 155$ MeV. The presented picture is supported by the observed suppression of resonance yields in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC."

In virtual reality, analogously, we can be a super-powered virtual giant who can supervise a swarm of mobile robots in a vast and remote environment by flying over or resizing the world and coordinate them by picking and placing a robot or creating virtual walls. This work implements this idea by using Virtual Reality along with Leap Motion, which is then validated by proof-of-concept experiments using real and virtual mobile robots in mixed reality. We conduct a usability analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the overall system as well as the individual interfaces proposed in this work. The results revealed that the proposed method is intuitive and feasible for interaction with swarm robots, but may require appropriate training for the new end-user interface device."

If it is possible to generate an image that is close to the input image from a generated caption, i.e., if it is possible to generate a natural language caption containing sufficient information to reproduce the image, then the caption is considered to be faithful to the image. To make such regeneration possible, learning using the cycle-consistency loss is effective. In this study, we propose a method of generating captions by learning end-to-end mutual transformations between images and texts. To evaluate our method, we perform comparative experiments with and without the cycle consistency. The results are evaluated by an automatic evaluation and crowdsourcing, demonstrating that our proposed method is effective."

A cesium vapor cell was hung from a thin wire in a vacuum chamber, and irradiated from the bottom with circularly polarized light tuned to the $D_2$ transition to polarize cesium atoms in the cell. By varying the light helicity at the resonance frequency of the torsion balance, we induced forced rotational oscillation of the cell and detected radiation torque exerted on the cesium vapor cell through the cesium atoms inside. The torque was particularly large when both hyperfine levels of cesium atoms were optically pumped with application of a longitudinal magnetic field. Further detailed study will provide new insights into spin-transfer processes at the gas-solid interface."

A particularly promising technology are recently discovered topolectrical circuits that achieve robust electric signal transduction by mimicking edge currents in quantum Hall systems. In parallel, modern active matter research has shown how autonomous units driven by internal energy reservoirs can spontaneously self-organize into collective coherent dynamics. Here, we unify key ideas from these two previously disparate fields to develop design principles for active topolectrical circuits (ATCs) that can self-excite topologically protected global signal patterns. Building on a generic nonlinear oscillator representation, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the emergence of self-organized protected edge states in ATCs. The good agreement between theory, simulations and experiment implies that ATCs can be realized in many different ways. Beyond topological protection, we also show how one can induce persistent localized bulk wave patterns by strategically placing defects in 2D lattice ATCs. These results lay the foundation for the practical implementation of autonomous electrical circuits with robust functionality in arbitrarily high dimensions."

This phenomenon is known as recognizing the ""gist"" of the scene and is accomplished by relying on relevant prior knowledge. This paper addresses the analogous question of whether using memory in computer vision systems can not only improve the accuracy of object detection in video streams, but also reduce the computation time. By interleaving conventional feature extractors with extremely lightweight ones which only need to recognize the gist of the scene, we show that minimal computation is required to produce accurate detections when temporal memory is present. In addition, we show that the memory contains enough information for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms to learn an adaptive inference policy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among mobile methods on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset, while running at speeds of up to 70+ FPS on a Pixel 3 phone."

However, their simulation is challenging as their sample paths are infinite-dimensional and their transition function is typically intractable. In many statistical settings (such as parameter inference for discretely observed diffusions), we require simulation techniques for diffusions conditioned on hitting an endpoint, which introduces further complication. In this paper we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating diffusion bridges which is both exact (in the sense that there is no discretisation error) and has computational cost that is linear in the duration of the bridge. Our approach works directly on diffusion path space, by constructing a proposal (which we term a confluence) with finite computational cost which is then accepted/rejected using a computable probability. The novelty of our method is that it only requires the simulation of unconditioned diffusion sample paths. Our methodology develops a number of simulation techniques we believe to be of independent interest, related to the crossing and first passage times of multiple Brownian motions, meanders and bridges, and Bessel bridges. We apply our methodology to the simulation of Langevin diffusion bridges, a practical problem arising naturally in statistical fusion settings."

In the past, persistent efforts have been made to detect such attacks. But there are still some common defects in the existing methods including unable to capture unknown attacks, high overhead of resource and time, and just can be used to detect specific formats of documents. In this study, a new Framework named ESRMD (Entropy signal Reflects the Malicious document) is proposed, which can detect malicious document based on the entropy distribution of the file. In essence, ESRMD is a machine learning classifier. What makes it distinctive is that it extracts global and structural entropy features from the entropy of the malicious documents rather than the structural data or metadata of the file, enduing it the ability to deal with various document formats and against the parser-confusion and obfuscated attacks. In order to assess the validity of the model, we conducted extensive experiments on a collected dataset with 10381 samples in it, which contains malware (51.47%) and benign (48.53%) samples. The results show that our model can achieve a good performance on the true positive rate, precision and ROC with the value of 96.00%, 96.69% and 99.2% respectively. We also compared ESRMD with some leading antivirus engines and prevalent tools. The results showed that our framework can achieve a better performance compared with these engines and tools."

An approach to build such signature schemes is to derive it from an identification protocol through the Fiat-Shamir transform. All such protocols based on codes must be run several rounds, since each run of the protocol allows a cheating probability of either 2/3 or 1/2. The resulting signature size is proportional to the number of rounds, thus making the 1/2 cheating probability version more attractive. We present a signature scheme based on double circulant codes in the rank metric, derived from an identification protocol with cheating probability of 2/3. We reduced this probability to 1/2 to obtain the smallest signature among signature schemes based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm, around 22 KBytes for 128 bit security level. Furthermore, among all code-based signature schemes, our proposal has the lowest value of signature plus public key size, and the smallest secret and public key sizes. We provide a security proof in the Random Oracle Model, implementation performances, and a comparison with the parameters of the most important code-based signature schemes."

Ensuring the quality and correctness of software is challenging because each program has different configurations and input domains. To ensure the quality of software, all possible configurations and input combinations need to be evaluated against their expected outputs. However, this exhaustive test is impractical because of time and resource constraints due to the large domain of input and configurations. Thus, different sampling techniques have been used to sample these input domains and configurations. Objective: Combinatorial testing can be used to effectively detect faults in software-under-test. This technique uses combinatorial optimization concepts to systematically minimize the number of test cases by considering the combinations of inputs. This paper proposes a new strategy to generate combinatorial test suite by using cuckoo search concepts. Method: Cuckoo Search is used in the design and implementation of a strategy to construct optimized combinatorial sets. The strategy consists of different algorithms for construction. These algorithms are combined to serve the Cuckoo Search. Results: The efficiency and performance of the new technique were proven through different experiment sets. The effectiveness of the strategy is assessed by applying the generated test suites on a real-world case study for the purpose of functional testing. Conclusion: Results show that the generated test suites can detect faults effectively. In addition, the strategy also opens a new direction for the application of Cuckoo Search in the context of software engineering."

We show that the bond dimension of these MPS approximations can be improved to a constant, independent of the chain length, if we relax our notion of approximation to be more local: for all length-$k$ segments of the chain, the reduced density matrices of our approximations are $\epsilon$-close to those of the exact state. If the state is a ground state of a gapped local Hamiltonian, the bond dimension of the approximation scales like $(k/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$, and at the expense of worse but still $\text{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$ scaling of the bond dimension, we give an alternate construction with the additional features that it can be generated by a constant-depth quantum circuit with nearest-neighbor gates, and that it applies generally for any state with exponentially decaying correlations. For a completely general state, we give an approximation with bond dimension $\exp(O(k/\epsilon))$, which is exponentially worse, but still independent of $N$. Then, we consider the prospect of designing an algorithm to find a local approximation for ground states of gapped local 1D Hamiltonians. When the Hamiltonian is translationally invariant, we show that the ability to find $O(1)$-accurate local approximations to the ground state in $T(N)$ time implies the ability to estimate the ground state energy to $O(1)$ precision in $O(T(N)\log(N))$ time."

In all these systems wrinkles develop in presence of compressively stressed thin films lying on compliant substrates. Here we demonstrate the controlled growth of self-organized nanopatterns exploiting a wrinkling instability on a solid-state substrate. Soda-lime glasses are modified in the surface layers by a defocused ion beam which triggers the formation of a compressively stressed surface layer deprived of alkali ions. When the substrate is heated up near its glass transition temperature, the wrinkling instability boosts the growth rate of the pattern by about two orders of magnitude. High aspect ratio anisotropic ripples bound by faceted ridges are thus formed which represent an optimal template for guiding the growth of large area arrays of functional nanostructures. We demonstrate the engineering over large square cm areas of quasi-1D arrays of Au nanostripe dimers endowed with tunable plasmonic response, strong optical dichroism and high electrical conductivity. These peculiar functionalities allow to exploit these large area substrates as active metamaterials in nanophotonics, biosensing and optoelectronics."

UWMIC with tri-axis coils increases the reliability of the wireless channel by exploring the coil orientation diversity. However, the UWMIC channel is different from typical fading channels and the mutual inductance information (MII) is not always available. It is not clear the performance of the tri-axis coil MIMO without MII. Also, its performances with multiple users have not been investigated. In this paper, we analyze the reliability and multiplexing gain of UWMICs with tri-axis coils by using coil selection. We optimally select the transmit and receive coils to reduce the computation complexity and power consumption and explore the diversity for multiple users. We find that without using all the coils and MII, we can still achieve reliability. Also, the multiplexing gain of UWMIC without MII is 5dB smaller than typical terrestrial fading channels. The results of this paper provide a more power-efficient way to use UWMICs with tri-axis coils."

We compare $\Gamma_{\parallel}$ with the automorphism group $\Gamma_{\ell}$ of the left parallelism $\mathrel{\parallel_{\ell}}$, which is strictly related to $\mathrm{Aut}(H)$. We build up and discuss several examples showing that over certain quaternion skew fields it is possible to choose $\parallel$ in such a way that $\Gamma_{\parallel}$ is either properly contained in $\Gamma_{\ell}$ or coincides with $\Gamma_{\ell}$ even though ${\parallel} \neq{\mathrel{\parallel_{\ell}}}$."

The existing thermogeometric descriptions of these criticalities for the black holes deal with the whole thermogeometric manifold and its curvature. However, while observing the criticality, one only notices the behaviour of the relevant phase space variables and keep all other thermodynamic quantities as fixed. Therefore it is quite natural to investigate the geometrical behaviour of the induced metric, defined by these constant macroscopic variables, corresponding to the whole manifold of the thermogeometry. Using geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we precisely address this issue. It is observed that the extrinsic curvature of this induced metric also diverges at the critical point. This provides an alternative but important aspect of the thermogeometric description of phase transition of black holes. The entire formalism in this paper is very general as it is valid for any arbitrary black hole which shows the van der Waals type phase transition."

Specifically, solutions of the SCFT equations, corresponding to membranes in different geometries (planar, cylindrical, spherical, and pore) have been obtained for a model system composed of amphiphilic AB diblock copolymers and ABA triblock copolymers dissolved in A homopolymers. The free energy of the membranes with different geometries is then used to extract the bending modulus, Gaussian modulus, and line tension of the membranes. The results reveal that the bending modulus of the triblock membrane is greater than that of the diblock membrane. Furthermore, the Gaussian modulus and line tension of the triblock membrane indicate that the triblock membranes have higher pore formation energy than that of the diblock membranes. The equilibrium bridging and looping fractions of the triblock copolymers are also obtained. Implications of the theoretical results on the elastic properties of biologically equivalent lipid bilayers and the bolalipid membranes are discussed."

Here we introduce another qualitatively different phenomenon that may serve to indentify the fingerprints of EP in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics. Namely, we predict a topological-like phenomenon manifested as an abrupt change of monotonous to oscillatory behavior of the survival probability of the initially populated bound state with fundamental pulse parameters. This effect is suitable for an experimental confirmation, since bound state populations are measurable to high precision by standard techniques. Here we demonstrate our finding for helium atoms that interact with linearly chirped laser pulses."

Autoencoders are deep neural network used to compress high dimensional data such as pixelated images into small latent representations. This compression model is vital to efficiently learn policies, especially when learning on embedded systems. We have implemented this model on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded GPU, and evaluated the power consumption, throughput, and energy consumption of the autoencoders for various CPU/GPU core combinations, frequencies, and model parameters. Additionally, we have shown the reconstructions generated by the autoencoder to analyze the quality of the generated compressed representation and also the performance of the reinforcement learning agent. Finally, we have presented an assessment of the viability of training these models on embedded systems and their usefulness in developing autonomous policies. Using autoencoders, we were able to achieve 4-5 $\times$ improved performance compared to a baseline RL agent with a convolutional feature extractor, while using less than 2W of power."

However, due to the unpredictable domain shift, generalizing trained model to unseen scenarios is often suboptimal. Inspired by the observation that density maps of different scenarios share similar local structures, we propose a novel adversarial learning approach in this paper, i.e., CODA (\emph{Counting Objects via scale-aware adversarial Density Adaption}). To deal with different object scales and density distributions, we perform adversarial training with pyramid patches of multi-scales from both source- and target-domain. Along with a ranking constraint across levels of the pyramid input, consistent object counts can be produced for different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network produces much better results on unseen datasets compared with existing counting adaption models. Notably, the performance of our CODA is comparable with the state-of-the-art fully-supervised models that are trained on the target dataset. Further analysis indicates that our density adaption framework can effortlessly extend to scenarios with different objects. \emph{The code is available at https://github.com/Willy0919/CODA.}"

The additional contribution to the variance induced by the random noise is typically orders of magnitude larger than the one due to the gauge field. We propose a new family of stochastic estimators of single-propagator traces built upon a frequency splitting combined with a hopping expansion of the quark propagator, and test their efficiency in two-flavour QCD with pions as light as 190 MeV. Depending on the fermion bilinear considered, the cost of computing these diagrams is reduced by one to two orders of magnitude or more with respect to standard random-noise estimators. As two concrete examples of physics applications, we compute the disconnected contributions to correlation functions of two vector currents in the isosinglet omega channel and to the hadronic vacuum polarization relevant for the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In both cases, estimators with variances dominated by the gauge noise are computed with a modest numerical effort. Theory suggests large gains for disconnected three and higher point correlation functions as well. The frequency-splitting estimators and their split-even components are directly applicable to the newly proposed multi-level integration in the presence of fermions."

[Lett. Math. Phys. (2019), in press, arXiv:1901.01378] with a particular emphasis on barycenters. We introduce the family of generalized quantum Hellinger divergences, that are of the form $\phi(A,B)=\mathrm{Tr} \left((1-c)A + c B - A \sigma B \right),$ where $\sigma$ is an arbitrary Kubo-Ando mean, and $c \in (0,1)$ is the weight of $\sigma.$ We note that these divergences belong to the family of maximal quantum $f$-divergences, and hence are jointly convex and satisfy the data processing inequality (DPI). We derive a characterization of the barycenter of finitely many positive definite operators for these generalized quantum Hellinger divergences. We note that the characterization of the barycenter as the weighted multivariate $1/2$-power mean, that was claimed in the work of Bhatia et al. mentioned above, is true in the case of commuting operators, but it is not correct in the general case."

Using, in part refining, techniques from nonlocal $H$-convergence for closed Hilbert complexes, we define the appropriate topology for possibly nonlocal and non-periodic coefficients in curl-div systems to model highly oscillatory behaviour of the coefficients on small scales. We address curl-div systems under various boundary conditions and analyse the limit of the ratio of small scale over large scale tending to zero. Already for standard Dirichlet boundary conditions and local coefficients the limit system is nontrivial and unexpected. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of highly oscillatory local coefficients for a curl-div system with impedance type boundary conditions relevant in scattering theory for Maxwell's equations and relate the abstract findings to local $H$-convergence and weak$*$-convergence of the coefficients."

For such field, we find light-cone gauge Lagrangian and realization of relativistic symmetries. We find a simple realization of spin operators entering our approach. Generalization of our results to the gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation is also described. We conjecture that, in the framework of AdS/CFT, the continuous-spin AdS field is dual to light-ray conformal operator. For some particular cases, our continuous-spin field leads to reducible models. We note two reducible models. The first model consists of massive scalar, massless vector, and partial continuous-spin field involving fields of all spins greater than one, while the second model consists of massive vector, massless spin-2 field, and partial continuous-spin field involving all fields of spins greater than two."

We compare dwarfs around individual Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, dwarfs in Local Group (LG)-like environments, and true field (i.e. isolated) dwarf galaxies. We reproduce observed trends wherein higher-mass dwarfs quench later (if at all), regardless of environment. We also identify differences between the environments, both in terms of ""satellite vs. central"" and ""LG vs. individual MWvs. isolated dwarf central."" Around the individual MW-mass hosts, we recover the result expected from environmental quenching: central galaxies in the ""near field"" have more extended SFHs than their satellite counterparts, with the former more closely resemble isolated (""true field"") dwarfs (though near-field centrals are still somewhat earlier forming). However, this difference is muted in the LG-like environments, where both near-field centrals and satellites have similar SFHs, which resemble satellites of single MW-mass hosts. This distinction is strongest for $M_\ast = 10^6 - 10^7\,M_\odot$ but exists at other masses. Our results suggest that the paired halo nature of the LG may regulate star formation in dwarf galaxies even beyond the virial radii of the MW and Andromeda. Caution is needed when comparing zoom-in simulations targeting isolated dwarf galaxies against observed dwarf galaxies in the LG."

The enormous freedom in metasurface design motivates the implementation of polarization control in ultrathin and compact optical systems. However, the majority of proposed strategies based on metasurfaces have been demonstrated only a spatially homogeneous polarization generation, while less attention has been devoted to spatially variant inhomogeneous vector beams. Here, we demonstrate a novel method for generating arbitrary radial and azimuthal polarization beams with high efficiencies of up to 80% by utilizing transmission-type dielectric metasurfaces. Polarization conversion metasurfaces are suitable candidates for the implementation of polarization encryption, which we demonstrate by encoding a hidden image into the spatial polarization distribution. In addition, we show that the image pattern can be modified by appropriate polarization selection of the transmitted light. Such a method may provide a practical technique for a variety of applications such as imaging, encryption and anti-counterfeiting."

At face value however, distributional properties are not random variables, and hence conditioning them is a semantic error and type error in probabilistic programming languages. On the other hand, distributional properties are contingent on other variables in the model, change in value when we observe more information, and hence in a precise sense are random variables too. In order to capture the uncertain over distributional properties, we introduce a probability construct -- the random conditional distribution -- and incorporate it into a probabilistic programming language Omega. A random conditional distribution is a higher-order random variable whose realizations are themselves conditional random variables. In Omega we extend distributional properties of random variables to random conditional distributions, such that for example while the expectation a real valued random variable is a real value, the expectation of a random conditional distribution is a distribution over expectations. As a consequence, it requires minimal syntax to encode inference problems over distributional properties, which so far have evaded treatment within probabilistic programming systems and probabilistic modeling in general. We demonstrate our approach case studies in algorithmic fairness and robustness."

The BWT of two strings can also provide similarity measures between them, based on the observation that the more their symbols are intermixed in the transformation, the more the strings are similar. In this article we present two new algorithms to compute similarity measures based on the BWT for string collections. In particular, we present practical and theoretical improvements to the computation of the Burrows-Wheeler similarity distribution for all pairs of strings in a collection. Our algorithms take advantage of the BWT computed for the concatenation of all strings, and use compressed data structures that allow reducing the running time with a small memory footprint, as shown by a set of experiments with real and artificial datasets."

During the generative phase following training, audio input is taken from the output of the previous time step, and the parameters are externally controlled allowing the network to be played as a musical instrument. Building on an architecture developed in previous work, we focus on the learning and synthesis of transients - the temporal response of the network during the short time (tens of milliseconds) following the onset and offset of a control signal. We find that the network learns the particular transient characteristics of two different synthetic instruments, and furthermore shows some ability to interpolate between the characteristics of the instruments used in training in response to novel parameter settings. We also study the behaviour of the units in hidden layers of the RNN using various visualisation techniques and find a variety of volume-specific response characteristics."

This problem is motivated by a recent method of embedding an R-independent language into one that is maximal R-independent, where the method requires to use an asymmetric partition of R. We solve the problem when R is realized by a zero-avoiding transducer (with some bound k): if the absolute value of the input-output length discrepancy of a computation exceeds k then the length discrepancy of the computation cannot become zero. This class of relations properly contains all recognizable, all left synchronous, and all right synchronous relations. We leave the asymmetric partition problem open when R is not realized by a zero-avoiding transducer. We also show examples of total wordorderings for which there is a relation R that cannot be partitioned into two asymmetric rational relations such that one of them is decreasing with respect to the given word-ordering."

Here we purpose a generative TN classification (GTNC) approach for supervised learning. The strategy is to train the generative TN for each class of the samples to construct the classifiers. The classification is implemented by comparing the distance in the many-body Hilbert space. The numerical experiments by GTNC show impressive performance on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST dataset. The testing accuracy is competitive to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network while higher than the naive Bayes classifier (a generative classifier) and support vector machine. Moreover, GTNC is more efficient than the existing TN models that are in general discriminative. By investigating the distances in the many-body Hilbert space, we find that (a) the samples are naturally clustering in such a space; and (b) bounding the bond dimensions of the TN's to finite values corresponds to removing redundant information in the image recognition. These two characters make GTNC an adaptive and universal model of excellent performance."

These quotients induce a Verdier localization on the level of the bounded derived categories. This will be investigated in a follow-up paper."

The visual process underlying this aspect of human vision is thought to employ multiple different levels of visual analysis (shapes, objects, texture, layout, color, etc). In this paper, we postulate that the perception of image similarity is not an explicitly learned capability, but rather one that is a byproduct of learning others. This claim is supported by leveraging representations learned from a diverse set of visual tasks and using them jointly to predict perceptual similarity. This is done via simple feature concatenation, without any further learning. Nevertheless, experiments performed on the challenging Totally-Looks-Like (TLL) benchmark significantly surpass recent baselines, closing much of the reported gap towards prediction of human perceptual similarity. We provide an analysis of these results and discuss them in a broader context of emergent visual capabilities and their implications on the course of machine-vision research."

In this paper, as highly desired, a multifunctional PIC is proposed to cover the three key domains. The PIC is fabricated on InP platform by monolithically integrating four laser diodes and two modulators. Using the multifunctional PIC, seven fundamental functions across microwave signal generation, transmission and processing are demonstrated experimentally.

The calculation of the moments of the meta distribution requires the probability generating functional (PGFL) of the point process. In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) along high-speed motorways, the Poisson point process (PPP) is a poor deployment model, because the drivers, due to the high speeds, maintain large safety distances. In this paper, we model the distribution of inter-vehicle distance equal to the sum of a constant hardcore distance and an exponentially distributed random variable. We design a novel \emph{discretization model} for the locations of vehicles which can be used to approximate well the PGFL due to the hardcore point process and the meta distribution of the SIR generated from synthetic motorway traces. On the other hand, the PPP overestimates significantly the coefficient-of-variation of the meta distribution due to the hardcore process, and its predictions fail. In addition, we show that the calculation of the meta distribution becomes especially meaningful in the upper tail of the SIR distribution."

The implied covariance between features inspires our probabilisation of this line of linguistic inquiry---we develop a generative model of language based on exponential-family matrix factorisation. By modelling all languages and features within the same architecture, we show how structural similarities between languages can be exploited to predict typological features with near-perfect accuracy, outperforming several baselines on the task of predicting held-out features. Furthermore, we show that language embeddings pre-trained on monolingual text allow for generalisation to unobserved languages. This finding has clear practical and also theoretical implications: the results confirm what linguists have hypothesised, i.e.~that there are significant correlations between typological features and languages."

By the use of a sophisticated physical plus systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the Bagpipes code, we place strong constraints on the star-formation histories (SFHs) of individual objects. We firstly constrain the stellar mass vs stellar age relationship, finding a steep trend towards earlier average formation with increasing stellar mass of $1.48^{+0.34}_{-0.39}$ Gyr per decade in mass, although this shows signs of flattening at $M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot$. We show that this is consistent with other spectroscopic studies from $0 < z < 2$. This relationship places strong constraints on the AGN-feedback models used in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that, although the relationships predicted by Simba and IllustrisTNG agree well with observations at $z=0.1$, they are too shallow at $z=1$, predicting an evolution of $<0.5$ Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly, we consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst and quiescent galaxies, using our inferred SFH shapes and the distributions of galaxy physical properties on the UVJ diagram. The majority of our lowest-mass galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{10.5} M_\odot$) are consistent with formation in recent ($z<2$), intense starburst events, with timescales of $\lesssim500$ Myr. A second class of objects experience extended star-formation epochs before rapidly quenching, passing through both green-valley and post-starburst phases. The most massive galaxies in our sample are extreme systems: already old by $z=1$, they formed at $z\sim5$ and quenched by $z=3$. However, we find evidence for their continued evolution through both AGN and rejuvenated star-formation activity."

Indeed, both binary types can account for the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 even if its electromagnetic counterpart emission is taken into account. We propose a method that {requires neither information from the post-inspiral phase of the binary nor an electromagnetic counterpart} to identify mixed binaries of neutron stars merging with low-mass black holes using gravitational-waves alone. This method is based on the fact that certain neutron star properties that can be measured with gravitational-waves are common or similar for all neutron stars. For example all neutron stars share the same equation of state and if the latter is hadronic, neutron stars have similar radii. If a mixed binary is misidentified as a neutron star binary, the inferred neutron star properties will be misestimated and appear as outliers in a population of low-mass binaries. We show that as few as $\sim 5$ low-mass events will allow for the identification of the type of one event at the $80\%$ confidence level. We model the population of low-mass binaries with a hierarchical mixture model and show that we can constrain the existence of mixed binaries or measure their abundance relative to neutron star binaries to $\sim 0.1$ at the $68\%$ credible level with 100 events."

Traditional approaches consist of training a classification model using features extracted from the images, based on textures or morphological properties. Recently, deep-learning based methods have been applied directly to the raw (unprocessed) data. However, their usability is impacted by the paucity of annotated data in the biomedical sector. In order to leverage the learning capabilities of deep Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) within the confines of limited labelled data, in this study we shall investigate the transfer learning approaches that aim to apply the knowledge gained from solving a source (e.g., non-medical) problem, to learn better predictive models for the target (e.g., biomedical) task. As an alternative, we shall further propose a new adaptive and compact CNN based architecture that can be trained from scratch even on scarce and low-resolution data. Moreover, we conduct quantitative comparative evaluations among the traditional methods, transfer learning-based methods and the proposed adaptive approach for the particular task of cancer detection and identification from scarce and low-resolution histology images. Over the largest benchmark dataset formed for this purpose, the proposed adaptive approach achieved a higher cancer detection accuracy with a significant gap, whereas the deep CNNs with transfer learning achieved a superior cancer identification."

As $\vec{B}$ grows, an ion pressure anisotropy $p_{\perp,i} > p_{||,i}$ arises, due to the adiabatic invariance of the ion magnetic moment ($p_{||,i}$ and $p_{\perp,i}$ are the ion pressures parallel and perpendicular to $\vec{B}$). When initially $\beta_i = 0.5$ ($\beta_i \equiv 8\pi p_i/|\vec{B}|^2$, where $p_i$ is the ion isotropic pressure), the pressure anisotropy is limited mainly by inelastic pitch-angle scattering provided by the IC instability, which in turn produces a non-thermal tail in the ion energy spectrum. After $\vec{B}$ is amplified by a factor $\sim 2.7$, this tail can be approximated as a power-law of index $\sim 3.4$ plus two non-thermal bumps, and accounts for $2-3\%$ of the ions and $\sim 18\%$ of their kinetic energy. On the contrary, when initially $\beta_i =2$, the ion scattering is dominated by the mirror instability and the acceleration is suppressed. This implies that efficient ion acceleration requires that initially $\beta_i \lesssim 1$. Although we focus on cases where $\vec{B}$ is amplified by plasma shear, we check that the acceleration occurs similarly if $\vec{B}$ grows due to plasma compression. Our results are valid in a sub-relativistic regime where the ion thermal energy is $\sim 10\%$ of the ion rest mass energy.

Most of the route choice models link route characteristics of alternative routes to those chosen by the drivers. The models play an important role in prediction of traffic levels on different routes and thus assist in development of efficient traffic management strategies that result in minimizing traffic delay and maximizing effective utilization of transport system. High fidelity route choice models are required to predict traffic levels with higher accuracy. Existing route choice models do not take into account dynamic contextual conditions such as the occurrence of an accident, the socio-cultural and economic background of drivers, other human behaviors, the dynamic personal risk level, etc. As a result, they can only make predictions at an aggregate level and for a fixed set of contextual factors. For higher fidelity, it is highly desirable to use a model that captures significance of subjective or contextual factors in route choice. This paper presents a novel approach for developing high-fidelity route choice models with increased predictive power by augmenting existing aggregate level baseline models with information on drivers' responses to contextual factors obtained from Stated Choice Experiments carried out in an Immersive Virtual Environment through the use of knowledge distillation."

For a positive integer $t$, $P_t$ is the chordless path on $t$ vertices. A paraglider is the graph that consists of a chorless cycle $C_4$ plus a vertex adjacent to three vertices of the $C_4$. In this paper, we study the structure of ($P_5$, paraglider)-free graphs, and show that every such graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\le \lceil \frac{3}{2}\omega(G) \rceil$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ are the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. Our bound is attained by the complement of the Clebsch graph on 16 vertices. More strongly, we completely characterize all the ($P_5$, paraglider)-free graphs $G$ that satisfies $\chi(G)> \frac{3}{2}\omega(G)$. We also construct an infinite family of ($P_5$, paraglider)-free graphs such that every graph $G$ in the family has $\chi(G)=\lceil \frac{3}{2}\omega(G) \rceil-1$. This shows that our upper bound is optimal up to an additive constant and that there is no $(\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm to the chromatic number of ($P_5$, paraglider)-free graphs for any $\epsilon>0$."

To support high data rates, the midhaul is realized with a Passive Optical Network (PON). In this architecture, the data are stored at the central unit until the scheduler decides to transmit it through the mid-haul to an appropriate remote unit, and then over the air at the same slot. We study an optimal scheduling problem that arises in this context. This problem has two key features. First, multiple cells must be scheduled simultaneously for efficient operation. Second, the interplay between the time-varying wireless interface rates and the fixed capacity PON needs to be handled efficiently. In this paper, we take a comprehensive look at this resource allocation problem by formulating it as a utility-maximization problem. Using combinatorial techniques, we derive useful structural properties of the optimal allocation and utilize these results to design polynomial-time approximation algorithms and a pseudopolynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we numerically compare the performance of the proposed algorithms to heuristics which are natural generalizations of the ubiquitous Proportional Fair algorithm."

However, most of them are devoted to 2D face presentation attacks, rather than 3D face masks. Unlike the real face, the 3D face mask is usually made of resin materials and has a smooth surface, resulting in reflectance differences. So, we propose a novel detection method for 3D face mask presentation attack by modeling reflectance differences based on intrinsic image analysis. In the proposed method, the face image is first processed with intrinsic image decomposition to compute its reflectance image. Then, the intensity distribution histograms are extracted from three orthogonal planes to represent the intensity differences of reflectance images between the real face and 3D face mask. After that, the 1D convolutional network is further used to capture the information for describing different materials or surfaces react differently to changes in illumination. Extensive experiments on the 3DMAD database demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in distinguishing a face mask from the real one and show that the detection performance outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."

To perform this, we modelize a cooperative game-theoretic model for competitor service providers. A choreography (a peer-to-peer service composition model) needs a set of services to fulfill its requirements. Users must choose, for each requirement, which service providers will be used to enact the choreography at lowest cost. Due to the lack of centralization, vendors can form alliances to control the market. We propose a novel algorithm capable of detecting alliances among service providers, based on our findings showing that this game has an empty core, but a non-empty bargaining set."

To alleviate bottleneck situations, one of the important strategies is to control the input rate to suit the state of the road. In this study, we propose an effective velocity control of traveling particles, in which the particle velocity depends on the state of a bottleneck. To analyze our method, we modify the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and introduce a slow-to-start rule, which we refer to as controlled TASEP in the present paper. Flow improvement is verified in numerical simulations and theoretical analyses by using controlled TASEP."

These mediators can decay further out in the Sun or outside of the Sun. Compared to the standard scenario where DM particles annihilate directly into Standard Model particles close to the solar core, here we also obtain fluxes of gamma rays and charged cosmic rays. We simulate this scenario using a full three-dimensional model of the Sun, and include interactions and neutrino oscillations. In particular, we perform a model-independent study of the complementarity between neutrino and gamma ray fluxes by comparing the recent searches from IceCube, Super-Kamiokande, Fermi-LAT, ARGO and HAWC.   We find that the resulting neutrino fluxes are significantly higher at high energy when the mediators decay further out in the Sun. We also find that gamma ray searches place stronger constraints than neutrino searches on these models even in cases where the mediators decay mainly inside the Sun, except in the approximately inner 10% of the Sun where neutrino searches are more powerful. We present our results in a model-independent manner and release a new version of the WimpSim code that can be used to simulate this scenario for arbitrary mediator models."

The Hamiltonian dynamics in the bulk is perturbed by random exchanges of the neighbouring momenta such that the energy is locally conserved. We prove that in the stationary state the energy and the volume stretch profiles, in large scale limit, converge to the solutions of a diffusive system with Dirichlet boundary conditions. As a consequence the macroscopic temperature stationary profile presents a maximum inside the chain higher than the thermostats temperatures, as well as the possibility of uphill diffusion (energy current against the temperature gradient). Finally, we are also able to derive the non-stationary macroscopic coupled diffusive equations followed by the energy and volume stretch profiles."

A particular class of MOR techniques is balancing related methods which rely on simultaneously diagonalizing the system Gramians. This has been extensively studied for deterministic linear systems. The balancing procedure has already been extended to bilinear equations [1], an important subclass of nonlinear systems. The choice of Gramians in [1] is referred to be the standard approach. In [18], a balancing related MOR scheme for bilinear systems called singular perturbation approximation (SPA) has been described that relies on the standard choice of Gramians. However, no error bound for this method could be proved. In this paper, we extend the setting used in [18] by considering a stochastic system with bilinear drift and linear diffusion term. Moreover, we propose a modified reduced order model and choose a different reachability Gramian. Based on this new approach, an $L^2$-error bound is proved for SPA which is the main result of this paper. This bound is new even for deterministic bilinear systems."

We discuss identifiability conditions for average treatment effects in the target population and provide identification results. We show that assuming inferences are transportable from all trials in the collection to the same target population has implications for the law underlying the observed data. We propose average treatment effect estimators that rely on different working models and provide code for their implementation in statistical software. We discuss how to use the data to examine whether transported inferences are homogeneous across the collection of trials, sketch approaches for sensitivity analysis to violations of the identifiability conditions, and describe extensions to address non-adherence in the trials. Last, we illustrate the proposed methods using data from the HALT-C multi-center trial."

This raises the question of how individual opinions evolve in such a networked environment without grounding in a known reality. The dominant approach to studying this problem uses simple models from the social sciences on how individuals change their opinions when exposed to their social neighborhood, and applies them on large social networks.   We propose a novel model that incorporates two known social phenomena: (i) \emph{Biased Assimilation}: the tendency of individuals to adopt other opinions if they are similar to their own; (ii) \emph{Backfire Effect}: the fact that an opposite opinion may further entrench someone in their stance, making their opinion more extreme instead of moderating it. To the best of our knowledge this is the first model that captures the Backfire Effect. A thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of the proposed model reveals intuitive conditions for polarization and consensus to exist, as well as the properties of the resulting opinions."

Nevertheless, it still faces a harsh trade-off among the acquisition time, the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. Here we present a new compressive imaging approach with use of a strategy called cake-cutting which optimally reorders the deterministic Hadamard basis. By this means, the number of measurements can be dramatically reduced by more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, by exploiting the structured characteristic of the Hadamard matrix, we can accelerate the computational process and simultaneously reduce the memory consumption of storing the matrix. The proposed method is capable of recovering an image of the object, of pixel size $1024\times1024$, with a sampling ratio of even 0.2%, thereby realizing super sub-Nyquist sampling and significantly reducing the acquisition time. Moreover, through the differential modulation/measurements, we demonstrate this method with a single-photon single-pixel camera under low light condition and retrieve clear images through partially obscuring scenes. This described practical method complements the single-pixel imaging approaches and can be applied to a variety of fields, such as video, night vision goggles and automatic drive."

The metallicity distribution function of the bulge indicates that it comprises multiple populations, the more metal-poor end of which is particularly poorly understood. It is currently unknown if metal-poor bulge stars ([Fe/H] $<$ -1 dex) are part of the stellar halo in the inner most region, or a distinct bulge population or a combination of these. Cosmological simulations also indicate that the metal-poor bulge stars may be the oldest stars in the Galaxy. In this study, we successfully target metal-poor bulge stars selected using SkyMapper photometry. We determine the stellar parameters of 26 stars and their elemental abundances for 22 elements using R$\sim$ 47,000 VLT/UVES spectra and contrast their elemental properties with that of other Galactic stellar populations. We find that the elemental abundances we derive for our metal-poor bulge stars have much lower overall scatter than typically found in the halo. This indicates that these stars may be a distinct population confined to the bulge. If these stars are, alternatively, part of the inner-most distribution of the halo, this indicates that the halo is more chemically homogeneous at small Galactic radii than at large radii. We also find two stars whose chemistry is consistent with second-generation globular cluster stars. This paper is the first part of the Chemical Origins of Metal-poor Bulge Stars (COMBS) survey that will chemo-dynamically characterize the metal-poor bulge population."

We propose a novel end-to-end model that uses caption-to-image retrieval as a `downstream' task to guide the process of phrase localization. Our method, as a first step, infers the latent correspondences between regions-of-interest (RoIs) and phrases in the caption and creates a discriminative image representation using these matched RoIs. In a subsequent step, this (learned) representation is aligned with the caption. Our key contribution lies in building this `caption-conditioned' image encoding which tightly couples both the tasks and allows the weak supervision to effectively guide visual grounding. We provide an extensive empirical and qualitative analysis to investigate the different components of our proposed model and compare it with competitive baselines. For phrase localization, we report an improvement of 4.9% (absolute) over the prior state-of-the-art on the VisualGenome dataset. We also report results that are at par with the state-of-the-art on the downstream caption-to-image retrieval task on COCO and Flickr30k datasets."

It is shown that in some cases, the fluctuations couple to the optical nonlinearities of the medium and make its refractive index dependent on the polarization of the propagating wave. As a consequence, two light waves propagating in a same direction but with different polarizations will have different speeds, so there will be a Kerr-effect birefringence induced by quantum fluctuations. We consider the case of the electromagnetic field in a squeezed vacuum state, where there are regions where the mean squared electric field can be negative and the birefringence effect has the opposite sign to the Kerr effect in classical physics. We give some estimates for the magnitude of these effects, and discuss their possible observability."

In this study we use nanostructured phosphorene as a prototypical example to unfold such complex physics and develop a general first-principles framework to study exciton dynamics in low dimensional systems. Specifically we derived the radiative lifetime and light emission intensity from 2D to 0D systems based on many-body perturbation theory, and investigated the dimensionality and anisotropicity effects on radiative recombination lifetime both at 0 K and finite temperature, as well as polarization and angle dependence of emitted light. We show that the radiative lifetime at 0 K increases by an order of $10^3$ with the lowering of one dimension (i.e. from 2D to 1D nanoribbons or from 1D to 0D quantum dots). We also show that obtaining the radiative lifetime at finite temperature requires accurate exciton dispersion beyond the effective mass approximation. Finally, we demonstrate that monolayer phosphorene and its nanostructures always emit linearly polarized light consistent with experimental observations, different from in-plane isotropic 2D materials like MoS2 and h-BN that can emit light with arbitrary polarization, which may have important implications for quantum information applications."

However, there still exists two challenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the one hand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box which is in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, two text instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection which covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can relieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances with arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale of kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale kernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is effective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use segmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve texts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure (82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%.

Different from previous studies, we promote the energy efficiency by exploiting the specific characteristics of maritime channels and user mobility. Particularly, we utilize the shipping lane information to obtain the long-term position information of marine users, from which the large-scale channel state information is estimated. Based on that, the resource allocation is jointly optimized for all users and all time slots during the voyage, leading to a mixed 0-1 non-convex programming problem. We transform this problem into a convex one by means of variable substitution and time-sharing relaxation, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the power consumption compared with existing approaches, due to the global optimization over a much larger time span by utilizing the shipping lane information."

In this work, we set up reservoirs where the edges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0, and proceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1 to -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to characterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much we have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a finite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are symmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for characterizing the network. We find that changing the number of edges flipped in the network changes the rank of the covariance of a matrix consisting of the time series from the different nodes in the network, and speculate that this rank is important for understanding the reservoir computer performance."

These PtSe2 layers are grown by low-temperature, thermally-assisted conversion of predeposited Pt layers. Under applied flexure the PtSe2 layers show a decrease in electrical resistance signifying a negative gauge factor. The influence of the growth temperature and film thickness on the electromechanical properties of the PtSe2 layers is investigated. The best-performing strain gauges fabricated have a superior gauge factor to that of commercial metal-based strain gauges. Notably, the strain gauges offer good cyclability and are very robust, surviving repeated peel tests and immersion in water. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the stain gauges also show potential for high-frequency operation. This host of advantageous properties, combined with the possibility of further optimization and channel patterning, indicate that PtSe2 grown directly on polyimide holds great promise for future applications."

We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that allows evaluating the regions in the image space where a given model is more vulnerable, in terms of image transformations applied to the input, and face it with standard search algorithms. We further embed this idea in a training procedure, where we define new data augmentation rules according to the image transformations that the current model is most vulnerable to, over iterations. An empirical evaluation on classification and semantic segmentation problems suggests that the devised algorithm allows to train models that are more robust against content-preserving image manipulations and, in general, against distributional shifts."

In this Letter we utilize Zakharov's variational formulation of weakly nonlinear surface waves and, without truncating the Hamiltonian in its slope expansion, derive the equations of motion for unidirectional gravity waves propagating in a two-dimensional flow. We obtain an exact solution of the evolution equations in terms of the Lambert $W$-function. The associated flow field is irrotational. The maximum wave height occurs for a wave steepness of 0.2034 which compares to 0.3183 for the trochoidal wave and 0.1412 for the Stokes wave. Like in the case of Gerstner's solution, the limiting wave of a new type has a cusp of zero angle at its crest."

Due to the robustness of STIRAP, our proposal guarantees high flexibility and accuracy and, at variance with traditional spectral hole burning techniques, it may require substantially less time resources since it does not rely upon the spontaneous decay of an intermediate excited state. We investigate the effects on the scheme of dephasing and dissipation as well as of unintentional driving of undesired transitions due to a finite splitting of the initial and target state. Finally, we show that the pulses can be reversed to create narrow absorption structures inside a broad spectral hole, which can be used as qubits for precise quantum operations on inhomogeneously broadened few-level systems."

In contrast to solutions with dipolar differential rotation boundary, we find that even though the norm of Killing vector $\partial_t$ becomes spacelike for certain regions of polar angle $\theta$ when $\varepsilon>2$, solitons and black holes with quadrupolar differential rotation still exist and do not develop hair due to superradiance. Moreover, at the same temperature, the horizonal deformation of quadrupolar rotation is smaller than that of dipolar rotation. Furthermore, we also study the entropy and quasinormal modes of the solutions, which have the analogous properties to that of dipolar rotation."

This system consists of 2-link manipulator attached to the bottom of a quadrotor. This new system presents a solution for the limitations found in the current quadrotor manipulation system. By deriving the inverse kinematics, one can design the controller such that the desired end effector position and orientation can be tracked. To study the feasibility of the proposed system, a quadrotor with high enough payload to add the 2-link manipulator is designed and constructed. Experimental setup of the system is introduced with an experiment to estimate the rotors parameters. Its parameters are identified to be used in the simulation and controller design of the proposed system. System dynamics are derived briefly based on Newton Euler Method. The controller of the proposed system is designed based on Robust Internal-loop Compensator (RIC) and compared to Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Control (FMRLC) technique which was previously designed and tested for the proposed system. These controllers are tested for provide system stability and trajectory tracking under the effect of picking as well as placing a payload and under the effect of changing the operating region.

On the experimental side, our understanding of the possibilities and limitations of the major dark energy probes has evolved; here we summarize the major probes and their crucial challenges. On the theoretical side, the taxonomy of explanations for the accelerated expansion rate is better understood, providing clear guidance to the relevant observables. We argue that: i) improving statistical precision and systematic control by taking more data, supporting research efforts to address crucial challenges for each probe, using complementary methods, and relying on cross-correlations is well motivated; ii) blinding of analyses is difficult but ever more important; iii) studies of dark energy and modified gravity are related; and iv) it is crucial that R&D for a vibrant dark energy program in the 2030s be started now by supporting studies and technical R&D that will allow embryonic proposals to mature. Understanding dark energy, arguably the biggest unsolved mystery in both fundamental particle physics and cosmology, will remain one of the focal points of cosmology in the forthcoming decade."

Recently EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$ emerged as a ferromagnetic system where non-trivial temperature dependent transport properties are observed due to coexistence and competition of various magnetic and non-magnetic scattering processes. In the ferromagnetic state, the resistivity shows a $T^2$ temperature dependence possibly due to electron-magnon scattering and above the Curie temperature $T_c$, the dependence changes to $T^{3/2}$ behaviour indicating a correlation between transport and magnetic properties. In this paper, we show that the transport spin-polarization in EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$, a low Curie temperature ferromagnet, is as high ($\sim 40\%$) as that in some of the metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures. In addition, owing to the low Curie temperature of EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$, the temperature ($T$) dependence of $P_t$ could be measured systematically up to $T_c$ which revealed a proportionate relationship with magnetization $M_s$ vs. $T$. This indicates that such proportionality is far more universally valid than the ferromagnets with ideal parabolic bands. Furthermore, our band structure calculations not only helped understand the origin of such high spin polarization in EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$ but also provided a route to estimate the Hubbard $U$ parameter in complex metallic ferromagnets in general using experimental inputs."

Attackers may look for vulnerabilities in commercialproducts or execute sophisticated reconnaissance campaigns tounderstand a targets network and gather information on securityproducts like firewalls and intrusion detection / prevention systems(network or host-based). Many new attacks tend to be modificationsof existing ones. In such a scenario, rule-based systems fail to detectthe attack, even though there are minor differences in conditions /attributes between rules to identify the new and existing attack. Todetect these differences the IDS must be able to isolate the subset ofconditions that are true and predict the likely conditions (differentfrom the original) that must be observed. In this paper, we proposeaprobabilistic abductive reasoningapproach that augments an exist-ing rule-based IDS (snort [29]) to detect these evolved attacks by (a)Predicting rule conditions that are likely to occur (based on existingrules) and (b) able to generate new snort rules when provided withseed rule (i.e. a starting rule) to reduce the burden on experts toconstantly update them.

This down-scaling in length compared to previous results in capillaries is achieved by using small core diameters (100 and 150 $\mu$m) and pumping with 6.3 fs pulses at 800 nm. We generate pulses with energies of 4 to 6 $\mu$J across the deep ultraviolet in a 100 $\mu$m capillary and up to 11 $\mu$J in a 150 $\mu$m capillary. From comparisons to simulations we estimate the ultraviolet pulse to be 2 to 2.5 fs in duration. We also numerically study the influence of pump duration on the bandwidth of the dispersive wave.

We correlate the electron mean free path with the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and the absolute Seebeck coefficient $S_{\text{Pt}}$ of platinum. We use a measurement platform as a standardized method to determine $S_{\text{Pt}}$ and show that $S_{\text{Pt,film}}$ is reduced compared to $S_{\text{Pt,bulk}}$. Boundary and surface scattering reduce the thermodiffusion and the phonon drag contribution to $S_{\text{Pt,film}}$ by nearly the same factor. A detailed discussion and a model to describe the temperature dependence of the absolute Seebeck coefficient and the influence of size effects of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interaction on $S_{\text{Pt}}$ is given."

The corresponding versions with $L^\infty$ endpoint was first introduced by Klainerman and is the basis of the classical vector field method, which is now one of the standard techniques for studying long-time behavior of nonlinear evolution equations. We were motivated in our pursuit by settings where the vector field method is applied to an energy hierarchy with growing higher order energies. In these settings the use of the $L^p$ endpoint versions of Sobolev inequalities can allow one to gain essentially one derivative in the estimates, which would then give a corresponding gain of decay rate. The paper closes with the analysis of one such model problem, where our new estimates provide an improvement."

This gives access to a variety of avalanche dominated, self-organization scenarios, prominently including self-organized criticality, as well as sub- and supercritical dynamics. We analyze the dependence of the dynamics on external scales and spatial dimensionality.

We present the first study of galaxy major mergers (mass ratios $>$ 1:4) in mass-selected samples out to $z\approx6$. Using all five fields of the HST/CANDELS survey and a probabilistic pair count methodology that incorporates the full photometric redshift posteriors and corrections for stellar mass completeness, we measure galaxy pair-counts for projected separations between 5 and 30 kpc in stellar mass selected samples at $9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.3$ and $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. We find that the major merger pair fraction rises with redshift to $z\approx6$ proportional to $(1+z)^{m}$, with $m = 0.8\pm0.2$ ($m = 1.8\pm0.2$) for $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*} / \rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$ ($9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.3$). Investigating the pair fraction as a function of mass ratio between 1:20 and 1:1, we find no evidence for a strong evolution in the relative numbers of minor to major mergers out to $z<3$. Using evolving merger timescales we find that the merger rate per galaxy ($\mathcal{R}$) rises rapidly from $0.07\pm 0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z < 1$ to $7.6\pm 2.7$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z = 6$ for galaxies at $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. The corresponding co-moving major merger rate density remains roughly constant during this time, with rates of $\Gamma \approx 10^{-4}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Based on the observed merger rates per galaxy, we infer specific mass accretion rates from major mergers that are comparable to the specific star-formation rates for the same mass galaxies at $z>3$ - observational evidence that mergers are as important a mechanism for building up mass at high redshift as in-situ star-formation."

Because the players choose sequentially, the second mover has the advantage. In fact, for any three-flip pattern, there is another three-flip pattern that is strictly more likely to occur first. This paper provides a novel no-arbitrage argument that generates the winning odds corresponding to any pair of distinct patterns. The resulting odds formula is equivalent to that generated by Conway's ""leading number"" algorithm. The accompanying betting odds intuition adds insight into why Conway's algorithm works. The proof is simple and easy to generalize to games involving more than two outcomes, unequal probabilities, and competing patterns of various length. Additional results on the expected duration of Penney's game are presented. Code implementing and cross-validating the algorithms is included."

Three basic holographic recording geometries currently exist, including on-axis, off-axis and slightly off-axis holography, each of them enabling a variety of architectures in terms of bandwidth use and compression capacity. Specifically, off-axis holography and slightly off-axis holography allow spatial hologram multiplexing, enabling compressing more information into the same digital hologram. In this paper, we define an efficiency score used to analyze the various possible architectures, and compare the signal-to-noise ratio and mean squared error obtained using each of them, determining the optimal holographic method."

We use the VLA COSMOS 3GHz map (noise $\rm rms=2.3\,\mu Jy \,beam^{-1}$, $\theta_{\rm beam}=0.75\,\rm arcsec$) to construct a mass-complete sample of 3184 radio-selected SFGs that reside on and above the main-sequence (MS) of SFGs. We find no clear dependence between the radio size and stellar mass, $M_{\star}$, of SFGs with $10.5\lesssim\log(M_\star/\rm M_\odot)\lesssim11.5$. Our analysis suggests that MS galaxies are preferentially extended, while SFGs above the MS are always compact. The median effective radius of SFGs on (above) the MS of $R_{\rm eff}=1.5\pm0.2$ ($1.0\pm0.2$) kpc remains nearly constant with cosmic time; a parametrization of the form $R_{\rm eff}\propto(1+z)^\alpha$ yields a shallow slope of only $\alpha=-0.26\pm0.08\,(0.12\pm0.14)$ for SFGs on (above) the MS. The size of the stellar component of galaxies is larger than the extent of the radio continuum emission by a factor $\sim$2 (1.3) at $z=0.5\,(2)$, indicating star formation is enhanced at small radii. The galactic-averaged star formation rate surface density $(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})$ scales with the distance to the MS, except for a fraction of MS galaxies ($\lesssim10\%$) that harbor starburst-like $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. These ""hidden"" starbursts might have experienced a compaction phase due to disk instability and/or merger-driven burst of star formation, which may or may not significantly offset a galaxy from the MS. We thus propose to jointly use $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and distance to the MS to better identify the galaxy population undergoing a starbursting phase."

However, the way these backflows manifest and how to detect them is unclear. A natural approach is to study the backflow in terms of the correlations the evolving system displays with another unperturbed system during the dynamics. In this work, we study the power of this approach to witness non-Markovian dynamics using different correlation measures. We identify simple dynamics where the failure of completely-positive divisibility is in one-to-one correspondence with a correlation backflow. We then focus on specific correlation measures, such as those based on entanglement and the mutual information, and identify their strengths and limitations. We conclude with a study of a recently introduced correlation measures based on state distinguishability and see how, for these measures, adding an extra auxiliary system enlarges the set of detectable non-Markovian dynamics."

In our scenario, chondrite lithification occurs by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) simultaneously with chondrule formation, in accordance with the constraints of complementarity and cluster chondrites. Thermal models of LDPs formed near t=0 predict that there will be a very narrow window of time, coincident with the chondrule formation epoch, during which crusts are thin enough to frequently rupture by impact, volcanism and/or crustal foundering, releasing hot magma to their surfaces. The heating curves we calculate are more gradual and symmetric than the ""flash heating"" characteristic of nebular models, but in agreement with the constraints of experimental petrology. The SPP itself is a plausible source of the excess O, Na and Si vapor pressure (compared to a solar nebula environment) that is required by chondrule observations. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that FeO-poor porphyritic olivine chondrules, the most voluminous type of chondrule, can be made using heating and cooling curves predicted by the ""flyby"" model. If chondrules are a by-product of chondrite lithification, then their high volume abundance within well-lithified chondritic material is not evidence that they were once widespread within the Solar System. Relatively rare events, such as the flybys modeled here, could account for their abundance in the meteorite record."

In this regard, wide-bandgap semiconductors are an emerging material platform with scalable wafer fabrication methods, hosting several promising spin-active point defects. Conventional readout protocols for such defect spins rely on fluorescence detection and are limited by a low photon collection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a photo-electrical detection technique for electron spins of silicon vacancy ensembles in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (SiC). Further, we show coherent spin state control, proving that this electrical readout technique enables detection of coherent spin motion. Our readout works at ambient conditions, while other electrical readout approaches are often limited to low temperatures or high magnetic fields. Considering the excellent maturity of SiC electronics with the outstanding coherence properties of SiC defects the approach presented here holds promises for scalability of future SiC quantum devices."

However, few of these methods preserve more than one conservation law locally. A recently-introduced strategy uses symbolic algebra to construct finite difference schemes that preserve several local conservation laws of a given scalar PDE in Kovalevskaya form. In this paper, we adapt the new strategy to PDEs that are not in Kovalevskaya form and to systems of PDEs. The Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation and a system equivalent to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are used as benchmarks, showing that the strategy yields conservative schemes which are robust and highly accurate compared to others in the literature."

However, as time passes, certain knowledge in answers may become obsolete. Such obsolete answers, if not identified or documented clearly, may mislead answer seekers and cause unexpected problems (e.g., using an out-dated security protocol). In this paper, we investigate how the knowledge in answers becomes obsolete and identify the characteristics of such obsolete answers. We find that: 1) More than half of the obsolete answers (58.4%) were probably already obsolete when they were first posted. 2) When an obsolete answer is observed, only a small proportion (20.5%) of such answers are ever updated. 3) Answers to questions in certain tags (e.g., node.js, ajax, android, and objective-c) are more likely to become obsolete. Our findings suggest that Stack Overflow should develop mechanisms to encourage the whole community to maintain answers (to avoid obsolete answers) and answer seekers are encouraged to carefully go through all information (e.g., comments) in answer threads."

The optimal hyper-parameters that minimize generalization error of the model are usually unknown. In practice they are often estimated using split-sample validation. Up to now, there is an open question regarding how the generalization error of the selected model grows with the number of hyper-parameters to be estimated. To answer this question, we establish finite-sample oracle inequalities for selection based on a single training/test split and based on cross-validation. We show that if the model-estimation procedures are smoothly parameterized by the hyper-parameters, the error incurred from tuning hyper-parameters shrinks at nearly a parametric rate. Hence for semi- and non-parametric model-estimation procedures with a fixed number of hyper-parameters, this additional error is negligible. For parametric model-estimation procedures, adding a hyper-parameter is roughly equivalent to adding a parameter to the model itself. In addition, we specialize these ideas for penalized regression problems with multiple penalty parameters. We establish that the fitted models are Lipschitz in the penalty parameters and thus our oracle inequalities apply. This result encourages development of regularization methods with many penalty parameters."

We show that these partitions are reduced to equitable 2-partitions of $H(3,q)$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_{2}(3,q)$ with exception of two constructions."

It provides a powerful tool to study pure edge topological phase transitions on the edges of 2d topological orders (without altering the bulks). In particular, it implies that the critical points are described by enriched fusion categories. In this work, we illustrate this idea in a concrete example: the 2d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. In particular, we construct an enriched fusion category, which describes a gappable non-chiral gapless edge of the 2d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order; then use an explicit lattice model construction to realize the critical point and, at the same time, all the ingredients of this enriched fusion category."

In this paper, we discuss the effects of cooling rate, annealing time and annealing temperature on the transport properties of TiSe$_2$: slow cooling of polycrystalline TiSe$_2$ post-synthesis drastically increases the low temperature resistivity, which is in contrast to the metallic behavior of single-crystalline TiSe$_2$ due to charge doping from the residual iodine transport agent. A logarithmic increase of resistivity upon cooling and negative magnetoresistance with a sharp cusp around zero field are observed for the first time for the polycrystalline TiSe$_2$ samples, pointing to weak-localization effects due to low dimensionality. Annealing at low temperatures has a similar, but less drastic effect. Furthermore, rapid quenching of the polycrystalline samples from high temperatures freezes in disorder, leading to a decrease in the low temperature resistivity."

We consider a simulated physical system where each GPS trajectory is attracted or repelled by the underlying road network via electrical-like forces. We let the system evolve under the action of these physical forces such that individual trajectories are attracted towards candidate roads to obtain a map matching path. Our approach has several advantages compared to traditional, routing-based, algorithms for map matching, including the ability to account for noise and to avoid large detours due to outliers in the data whilst taking into account the underlying topological restrictions (such as one-way roads). Our empirical evaluation using real GPS traces shows that our method produces better map matching results compared to alternative offline map matching algorithms on average, especially for routes in dense, urban areas."

On-Board Units (OBU) are efficient computers inside vehicles that serve safety and non-safety based applications. However, much of these resources are underutilised. On the other hand, more users are relying now on cloud computing which is becoming costly and energy consuming. In this paper, we develop a Mixed Integer linear Programming (MILP) model that optimizes the allocation of processing demands in an architecture that encompasses the vehicles, edge and cloud computing with the objective of minimizing power consumption. The results show power savings of 70%-90% compared to conventional clouds for small demands. For medium and large demand sizes, the results show 20%-30% power saving as the cloud was used partially due to capacity limitations on the vehicular and edge nodes."

While synthesized data sets can be used to overcome this challenge, it is important that these data sets close the reality gap, i.e., a model trained on synthetic image data is able to generalize to real images. Whereas, the reality gap can be considered bridged in several application scenarios, training on synthesized images containing reflecting materials requires further research. Since the appearance of objects with reflecting materials is dominated by the surrounding environment, this interaction needs to be considered during training data generation. Therefore, within this paper we examine the effect of reflecting materials in the context of synthetic image generation for training object detectors. We investigate the influence of rendering approach used for image synthesis, the effect of domain randomization, as well as the amount of used training data. To be able to compare our results to the state-of-the-art, we focus on indoor scenes as they have been investigated extensively. Within this scenario, bathroom furniture is a natural choice for objects with reflecting materials, for which we report our findings on real and synthetic testing data."

More recently, the strength of the nuclear symmetry energy has been investigated by measuring the ratios or differences of the elliptic flows exhibited by neutrons and charged particles in 197Au+197Au collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon incident energy at the GSI laboratory. A moderately soft to linear dependence on density was deduced for a range of densities shown to reach beyond twice the saturation value in these experiments. The known sources of uncertainties and possible model dependencies were thoroughly studied with transport models of the UrQMD and Tuebingen QMD type. A new source of information on the nuclear equation of state at high density has opened up with the observation of the first LIGO and Virgo GW170817 gravitational wave signal from a neutron star merger. The quantitative comparison of terrestrial and celestial results on the basis of measured or inferred neutron star radii or core pressures, including those obtained from X-ray observations, reveals a rather satisfactory agreement. Depending on the precision that can be achieved with future measurements and observations, it will thus become possible to assess the validity of the applied models and methods. The perspectives for improved experiments at FAIR using the NeuLAND and KRAB detection systems are outlined."

SMC algorithms typically include a resampling step. There are many possible ways to resample, but the relative advantages of different resampling schemes remains poorly understood. Here, a theoretical framework for comparing resampling schemes is presented. The framework uses resampling matrices to provide a simple description for the SMC resampling step. The framework identifies the matrix resampling scheme that gives the lowest possible error. The framework leads to new asymptotic error formulas that can be used to compare different resampling schemes."

Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics, requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy, and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies. These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of disorder in the solar magnetic field."

Quantum optimal control using the algorithm of Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) has been implemented in a negatively charged diamond nitrogen vacancy center that is coupled to a strong and resonant microwave field. We show that the dressed spin states are highly effective in suppressing effects of spin dephasing on adiabatic population transfer. The numerical simulation also demonstrates that CRAB-based quantum optimal control can enable an efficient and robust adiabatic population transfer.

Using a deep recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), we present the first method specifically designed to provide early classifications of astronomical time-series data, typing 12 different transient classes. Our classifier can process light curves with any phase coverage, and it does not rely on deriving computationally expensive features from the data, making RAPID well-suited for processing the millions of alerts that ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce. The classification accuracy improves over the lifetime of the transient as more photometric data becomes available, and across the 12 transient classes, we obtain an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and 0.98 at early and late epochs, respectively. We demonstrate RAPID's ability to effectively provide early classifications of observed transients from the ZTF data stream. We have made RAPID available as an open-source software package (https://astrorapid.readthedocs.io) for machine learning-based alert-brokers to use for the autonomous and quick classification of several thousand light curves within a few seconds."

There are two kinds of the graded Brown--McCoy radical, the graded Brown--McCoy and the large graded Brown--McCoy radical of a graded ring. Several characterizations of the graded Brown--McCoy radical are given, and it is proved that the large graded Brown--McCoy radical of a graded ring is the largest homogeneous ideal contained in the classical Brown--McCoy radical of that ring."

In this paper we investigate the atom-surface interaction effects upon the energy levels and wave functions of an hydrogen atom placed at the interface between a $\theta$-medium and the vacuum. In the approximation considered, the Schr\""{o}dinger equation can be exactly solved by separation of variables in terms of hypergeometic functions for the angular part and hydrogenic functions for the radial part. In order to make such effects apparent we deal with unrealistic high values of the $\theta$-parameter. We also compute the energy shifts using perturbation theory for a particular small value of $\theta$ and we demonstrate that they are in a very good agreement with the ones obtained from the exact solution."

The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require $\mathcal{O}\left(2^n\right)$ gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an $n$-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions -- implicitly given by data samples -- into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires $\mathcal{O}\left(poly\left(n\right)\right)$ gates and can, thus, enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application."

Predicting the mass of atomic nuclei with precision is extremely challenging. This is due to the non--trivial many--body interplay of protons and neutrons in nuclei, and the complex nature of the nuclear strong force. Statistical theory of learning will be used to provide bounds to the prediction errors of model trained with a finite data set. These bounds are validated with neural network calculations, and compared with state of the art mass models. Therefore, it will be argued that the nuclear structure models investigating ground state properties explore a system on the limit of the knowledgeable, as defined by the statistical theory of learning."

The main goal of this work is characterize Nash equilibria through a verification theorem, which identifies a new system of quasi-variational inequalities whose solution gives equilibrium payoffs with the correspondent strategies. Moreover, we apply the verification theorem to a game with a one-dimensional state variable, evolving as a scaled Brownian motion, and with linear payoff and costs for both players. Two types of Nash equilibrium are fully characterized, i.e. semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium strategies and associated payoffs are provided. Both equilibria are of threshold type: in one equilibrium players' intervention are not simultaneous, while in the other one the first player induces her competitor to stop the game. Finally, we provide some numerical results describing the qualitative properties of both types of equilibrium."

When the attractive fermion interaction is taken into account by the mean-field approximation, a phase diagram is obtained. It is found that a quantum phase transition from a band insulator state to quantum anomalous Hall state occurs with increased attractive interaction. For an existing quantum anomalous Hall state, the attractive interaction enlarges its nontrivial band gap and makes the topological edge states more localized, which protects the transport of linear-dispersive edge states against finite-size and further disorder effects."

Standard finite volume or finite difference schemes cannot keep this balance exactly due to their unbalanced truncation errors. In this study, we introduce an auxiliary variable which becomes constant at isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and propose a well-balanced gas kinetic scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with a global reconstruction. Through reformulating the convection term and the force term via the auxiliary variable, zero numerical flux and zero numerical source term are enforced at the hydrostatic equilibrium state instead of the balance between hydrostatic pressure and external force. Several problems are tested numerically to demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the new scheme, and the results confirm that, the new scheme can preserve the exact hydrostatic solution. The small perturbation riding on hydrostatic equilibria can be calculated accurately. The viscous effect is also illustrated through the propagation of small perturbation and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. More importantly, the new scheme is capable of simulating the process of converging towards hydrostatic equilibrium state from a highly non-balanced initial condition. The ultimate state of zero velocity and constant temperature is achieved up to machine accuracy. As demonstrated by the numerical experiments, the current scheme is very suitable for small amplitude perturbation and long time running under gravitational potential."

At this time, there exit precise physical results only for the quark EDM operator by the PNDME collaboration. First results showing signal in the contributions of the $\Theta$-term and the connected part of the chromo EDM operator have been presented. The challenge of divergent mixing in the chromo EDM and Weinberg operators has motivated calculations in the gradient flow scheme. While there has been steady progress, the challenges remaining are large. Results with $O(50\%)$ uncertainty with control over all systematic errors can be expected for the $\Theta$-term over the next five years. Prediction of a timeline for progress on the chromo EDM and the Weinberg operators will depend on when the renormalization and divergent mixing of these operators is brought under control.

Under $I_{\text{ST}}$, the Hamiltonian and the Bloch wave function can be constrained to be real-valued, which makes the Berry curvature and the Chern number to vanish. In this class of systems, gapped band structures of real wave functions can be topologically distinguished by Stiefel-Whitney numbers instead. The first and second Stiefel-Whitney numbers $w_1$ and $w_2$, respectively, are the corresponding invariants in 1D and 2D, which are equivalent to the quantized Berry phase and the $Z_2$ monopole charge, respectively. We first describe the topological phases characterized by the first Stiefel-Whitney number, including 1D topological insulators with quantized charge polarization, 2D Dirac semimetals, and 3D nodal line semimetals. Next we review how the second Stiefel-Whitney class characterizes the 3D nodal line semimetals carrying a $Z_{2}$ monopole charge. In particular, we explain how the second Stiefel-Whitney number $w_2$, the $Z_{2}$ monopole charge, and the linking number between nodal lines are related.

Even when the physics is modelled accurately, these extensions have been shown to be beneficial because they reduce the non-lineary of the resulting data-fitting problem. In this note, I derive an alternative (but equivalent) formulation of extended full waveform inversion.

Quantitative study of the relationship between kidney tumor morphology and clinical outcomes is difficult due to data scarcity and the laborious nature of manually quantifying imaging predictors. Automatic semantic segmentation of kidneys and kidney tumors is a promising tool towards automatically quantifying a wide array of morphometric features, but no sizeable annotated dataset is currently available to train models for this task. We present the KiTS19 challenge dataset: A collection of multi-phase CT imaging, segmentation masks, and comprehensive clinical outcomes for 300 patients who underwent nephrectomy for kidney tumors at our center between 2010 and 2018. 210 (70%) of these patients were selected at random as the training set for the 2019 MICCAI KiTS Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge and have been released publicly. With the presence of clinical context and surgical outcomes, this data can serve not only for benchmarking semantic segmentation models, but also for developing and studying biomarkers which make use of the imaging and semantic segmentation masks."

This preference to act differently from previous agents may paradoxically increase all but one agent's probability of matching the actions of the predecessors. The reason is that when previous agents conform to their predecessors despite the preference to differ, their actions become more informative. The desire to match predecessors' actions may reduce herding by a similar reasoning."

Let $S$ be the relative entropy with respect to this algebra, $A$ the area of the horizon cross section defined by the region, computed to second order in the gravitational perturbation.

The sheer complexity of power systems exceeding a few buses, however, makes it an extremely computationally demanding task. The emergence of deep learning methods that are able to handle immense amounts of data, and infer valuable information appears as a promising alternative. This paper has two main contributions. First, inspired by the remarkable performance of convolutional neural networks for image processing, we represent for the first time power system snapshots as 2-dimensional images, thus taking advantage of the wide range of deep learning methods available for image processing. Second, we train deep neural networks on a large database for the NESTA 162-bus system to assess both N-1 security and small-signal stability. We find that our approach is over 255 times faster than a standard small-signal stability assessment, and it can correctly determine unsafe points with over 99% accuracy."

This generalizes the result of [11], where the expansion of the full discriminant divisor (which is a linear combination of the classes mentioned above) was obtained.

For a collapsing radiating thin shell we derive a sufficient condition on the exterior geometry that ensures that a black hole is not formed. This is also a sufficient condition for an infalling test particle to avoid the apparent horizon of an existing black hole and approach it only within a certain minimal distance. Taking the presence of a trapped region and its outer boundary --- the apparent horizon--- as the defining feature of black holes, we explore the consequences of their finite time of formation according to a distant observer. Assuming regularity of the apparent horizon we obtain the limiting form of the metric and the energy-momentum tensor in its vicinity that violates the null energy condition (NEC). The metric does not satisfy the sufficient condition for horizon avoidance: a thin shell collapses to form a black hole and test particles (unless too slow) cross into it in finite time. However, there may be difficulty in maintaining the expected range of the NEC violation, and stability against perturbations is not assured."

Coarse-graining (CG) is an established approach to alleviate the impact of computational limits while retaining the same algorithms used in atomistic simulations. It is of importance to understand how algorithms such as Langevin integrators perform on non-trivial CG molecular systems, and in particular how large of an integration time step can be used without introducing unacceptable amounts of error into averaged quantities of interest. To investigate this, we examined three different Langevin integrators on a CG polymer melt: the recently developed BAOAB method by Leimkuhler and Matthews, the Gronbech-Jensen and Farago method, or G-JF, and the frequently used Brunger-Brooks-Karplus integrator, also known as BBK. We compute and analyze key statistical properties for each. Our results indicate that the three integrators perform similarly when using a small friction parameter; however, outside of this regime the use of large integration steps produces significant deviations from the predicted diffusivity and steady-state distributions for all integration methods examined with the exception of G-JF."

Optical gas imaging (OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this paper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable automatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane leaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m). Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants, collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of leaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by comparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the detection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can exceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely (~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater than 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m), performance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect large leaks (>950 gCH4/h). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be deployed in OGI surveys to allow automatic vigilance of methane leak detection with high detection accuracy in the real world."

Due to the large number of minutiae in a palmprint, approximately 1000 minutiae, the matching process is time consuming which makes it unpractical for real time applications. One way to address this issue is aligning all palmprint images to a reference image and bringing them to a same coordinate system. Bringing all palmprint images to a same coordinate system, results in fewer computations during minutia matching. In this paper, using convolutional neural network (CNN) and generalized Hough transform (GHT), we propose a new method to register palmprint images accurately. This method, finds the corresponding rotation and displacement (in both x and y direction) between the palmprint and a reference image. Exact palmprint registration can enhance the speed and the accuracy of matching process. Proposed method is capable of distinguishing between left and right palmprint automatically which helps to speed up the matching process. Furthermore, designed structure of CNN in registration stage, gives us the segmented palmprint image from background which is a pre-processing step for minutia extraction. The proposed registration method followed by minutia-cylinder code (MCC) matching algorithm has been evaluated on the THUPALMLAB database, and the results show the superiority of our algorithm over most of the state-of-the-art algorithms."

The difference is that averaging is performed over a variable-dependent set, that is called a set-valued mapping (SVM) satisfying simple conditions. Novelty approach is that with such an approximation we obtain twice continuously differentiable convex functions, for optimizations of which are applied methods of the second order. The estimation of the convergence rate of the method is given."

High-quality CoSi single crystals were found in the growth from tellurium solution. The sample's high carrier mobility enables us to observe, for the first time, quantum oscillations (QOs) in its thermoelectrical signals. Our analysis of QOs reveals two spherical Fermi surfaces around the R point in the Brillouin zone corner. The extracted Berry phases of these electron orbits are consistent with the -2 chiral charge as reported in DFT calculations. Detailed analysis on the QOs reveals that the spin-orbit coupling induced band-splitting is less than 2 meV near the Fermi level, one order of magnitude smaller than our DFT calculation result.

In this review, the success and the shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model, based on General Relativity and standard model of particles, are discussed in view of the most recent observational constraints. The motivations for considering extensions and modifications of General Relativity are taken into account, with particular attention to $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ theories of gravity where dynamics is represented by curvature or torsion field respectively. The features of $f(R)$ models are explored in metric and Palatini formalisms. We discuss the connection between $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor theories highlighting the role of conformal transformations in the Einstein and Jordan frames. Cosmological dynamics of $f(R)$ models is investigated through the corresponding viability criteria. Afterwards, the equivalent formulation of General Relativity (Teleparallel Equivalent General Relativity) in terms of torsion and its extension to $f(T)$ gravity is considered. Finally, the cosmographic method is adopted to break the degeneracy among dark energy models. A novel approach, built upon rational Pad\'e and Chebyshev polynomials, is proposed to overcome limits of standard cosmography based on Taylor expansion. The approach provides accurate model-independent approximations of the Hubble flow. Numerical analyses, based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain integration of cosmic data, are presented to bound coefficients of the cosmographic series. These techniques are thus applied to reconstruct $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ functions and to frame the late-time expansion history of the universe with no \emph{a priori} assumptions on its equation of state. A comparison between the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ models is reported."

How heterogeneous glassy materials can be and to what extent dynamics is encoded with structure and elasticity are long-standing puzzles in glass science. In this experiment, we probed the responses of binary colloidal glasses towards the excitations induced by highly focused laser pulses. We observed very similar excitation patterns when the laser was repeated in the linear region; directly proving that the dynamical heterogeneity is strongly encoded with structure. In the non-linear region, we identified a non-monotonic dynamical length scale as a function of area fraction, resulting from the non-monotonic coupling of momentum transfer in radial and orthogonal directions. Surprisingly, the excitation size and radius of gyration conformed to a universal scaling relation that covered both linear and non-linear regions. Our experiments offered a new strategy of actively probing the response of glassy materials on the microscopic level."

The default Bayes factor is based on generalized fractional Bayes methodology where different fractions are used for different observations and where the default prior is centered on the boundary of the constrained space under investigation. First, the method is fully automatic and therefore can be applied when prior information is weak or completely unavailable. Second, using group specific fractions, the same amount of information is used from each group resulting in a minimally informative default prior having a matrix Cauchy distribution. This results in a consistent default Bayes factor. Third, numerical computation can be done using parallelization which makes it computationally cheap. Fourth, the evidence can be updated in a relatively simple manner when observing new data. Fifth, the selection criterion can be applied relatively straightforwardly in the presence of missing data that are missing at random. Finally the methodology can be used for default model selection and hypothesis testing of commonly used models such as (M)AN(C)OVA, (multivariate) multiple regression, or repeated measures."

All of these languages use certain diagrammatic decorations, called !-boxes and phase variables, to indicate not just one diagram but an infinite family of diagrams. In this same manner one can express infinite families of equations between diagrams, and these decorations are powerful enough to allow for complete rulesets expressing any equivalence in pure state qubit quantum mechanics. We present here results that show that equations between separable infinite families of diagrams are finitely verifiable; that is to say that to verify these infinite families of equations it suffices to check a finite subset of that family, provided a condition we call separability is met. The results we present in this paper not only construct such a verifying subfamily directly, but also generalise to any diagrammatic calculus that satisfies certain simple conditions."

The problem is to describe the probability distribution of the orbit of the sum $A+B$. We study in particular the familiar case of coadjoint orbits, and also the orbits of self-adjoint real, complex and quaternionic matrices under the conjugation actions of $\mathrm{SO}(n)$, $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(n)$ respectively. The probability density can be expressed in terms of a function that we call the volume function. In this paper, (i) we relate this function to the symplectic or Riemannian geometry of the orbits, depending on the case; (ii) we discuss its non-analyticities and possible vanishing; (iii) in the coadjoint case, we study its relation to tensor product multiplicities (generalized Littlewood--Richardson coefficients) and show that it computes the volume of a family of convex polytopes introduced by Berenstein and Zelevinsky. These considerations are illustrated by a detailed study of the volume function for the coadjoint orbits of $B_2=\mathfrak{so}(5)$."

Here, we demonstrate a mechanism based on light-induced evaporative cooling of holes in a correlated electron system. Since the entropy of a filled narrow band grows rapidly with hole doping, the isentropic transfer of holes from a doped Mott insulator to such a band results in a drop of temperature. Strongly correlated Fermi liquids and symmetry-broken states could thus be produced by dipolar excitations. Using nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory, we show that suitably designed chirped pulses allow to realize this cooling effect. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of antiferromagnetic order in a system which is initially in a weakly correlated state above the maximum N\'eel temperature. Our work suggests a general strategy for inducing strong correlation phenomena and electronic orders in light-driven materials or periodically modulated atomic gases in optical lattice potentials."

While significant advances have been made from the recent deep convolutional neural networks, the quality of interpolation is often reduced due to large object motion or occlusion. In this work, we propose a video frame interpolation method which explicitly detects the occlusion by exploring the depth information. Specifically, we develop a depth-aware flow projection layer to synthesize intermediate flows that preferably sample closer objects than farther ones. In addition, we learn hierarchical features to gather contextual information from neighboring pixels. The proposed model then warps the input frames, depth maps, and contextual features based on the optical flow and local interpolation kernels for synthesizing the output frame. Our model is compact, efficient, and fully differentiable. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods on a wide variety of datasets."

We show that in low frequency region, the rotating field alone could efficiently drive the DW motion even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In this case, the DW rotates synchronously with the magnetic field, and a stable precession torque is available and drives the DW motion with a steady velocity. In large frequency region, the DW only oscillates around its equilibrium position and cannot propagate. The dependences of the velocity and critical frequency differentiating the two motion modes on several parameters are investigated in details, and the direction of the DW motion can be controlled by modulating the initial phase of the field. Interestingly, a unidirectional DW motion is predicted attributing to the bulk DMI, and the nonzero velocity for high frequency is well explained. Thus, this work does provide useful information for further antiferromagnetic spintronics applications."

The robustness of existing defenses suffers greatly under white-box attack settings, where an adversary has full knowledge about the network and can iterate several times to find strong perturbations. We observe that the main reason for the existence of such perturbations is the close proximity of different class samples in the learned feature space. This allows model decisions to be totally changed by adding an imperceptible perturbation in the inputs. To counter this, we propose to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep networks. Specifically, we force the features for each class to lie inside a convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance on clean images. We report extensive evaluations in both black-box and white-box attack scenarios and show significant gains in comparison to state-of-the art defenses."

The nature of the compact object in MAXI J1957+032 is not clear, but it was proposed to be a neutron star based on the short-duration of its outbursts. Here, we report the results obtained after performing spectral analysis using data obtained with the X-ray telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift satellite. When describing the spectrum with an absorbed power law, we found that the spectra softens (the power-law index increases from $\sim$ 1.8 to 2.5) as the luminosity decreases. Near the end of its outbursts the observed value of power-law index ($\Gamma$) is $\sim$ 2.5. To identify the nature of the compact object in this system, we used $\Gamma$ as a tracer of the spectral evolution with luminosity. We found that for the distance of 4 kpc, our results suggest that the source harbours a neutron star."

Expanding them to their intended meaning in context is important for Machine Reading tasks such as document search, recommendation and question answering. Existing approaches mostly rely on manually labeled examples of abbreviations and their correct long-forms. Such data sets are costly to create and result in trained models with limited applicability and flexibility. Importantly, most current methods must be subjected to a full empirical evaluation in order to understand their limitations, which is cumbersome in practice.   In this paper, we present an entirely unsupervised abbreviation disambiguation method (called UAD) that picks up abbreviation definitions from unstructured text. Creating distinct tokens per meaning, we learn context representations as word vectors. We demonstrate how to further boost abbreviation disambiguation performance by obtaining better context representations using additional unstructured text. Our method is the first abbreviation disambiguation approach with a transparent model that allows performance analysis without requiring full-scale evaluation, making it highly relevant for real-world deployments.   In our thorough empirical evaluation, UAD achieves high performance on large real-world data sets from different domains and outperforms both baseline and state-of-the-art methods. UAD scales well and supports thousands of abbreviations with multiple different meanings within a single model.   In order to spur more research into abbreviation disambiguation, we publish a new data set, that we also use in our experiments."

There has been recent surge in interest in using large batch stochastic optimization methods to tackle this issue. The most prominent algorithm in this line of research is LARS, which by employing layerwise adaptive learning rates trains ResNet on ImageNet in a few minutes. However, LARS performs poorly for attention models like BERT, indicating that its performance gains are not consistent across tasks. In this paper, we first study a principled layerwise adaptation strategy to accelerate training of deep neural networks using large mini-batches. Using this strategy, we develop a new layerwise adaptive large batch optimization technique called LAMB; we then provide convergence analysis of LAMB as well as LARS, showing convergence to a stationary point in general nonconvex settings. Our empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of LAMB across various tasks such as BERT and ResNet-50 training with very little hyperparameter tuning. In particular, for BERT training, our optimizer enables use of very large batch sizes of 32868 without any degradation of performance. By increasing the batch size to the memory limit of a TPUv3 Pod, BERT training time can be reduced from 3 days to just 76 minutes (Table 1). The LAMB implementation is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/master/tensorflow_addons/optimizers/lamb.py"

In this work, we present the classification of features in the substructure as a case study to illustrate the power of Bayesian inference when analysing nanopore data. A brief introductory section provides an overview of the core concepts, followed by a detailed description of the analysis procedure to facilitate other researchers to add Bayesian inference to their toolbox. Our hybrid approach of a classical peak-finding algorithm and Bayesian model comparison allows the probabilistic classification of features as ""0"" or ""1"" bits by calculating relative evidences for two competing models. We correctly classify on average ~ 70% of bits for individual events and use the probabilistic nature of the approach to calculate a cumulative estimate with an accuracy of > 94%. The technique presented here is readily extensible to models of the translocation process which can take into account arbitrary molecular designs, our approach may therefore be used to analyse a wide range of features observed in nanopore experiments."

We also consider different cases for vanishing and nonvanishing lepton asymmetry where the latter one is constrained by cosmic microwave background experiments. Our results show that there is up to a few percent deviation in the predicted gravitational wave background in the frequency range around the QCD transition ($10^{-10}- 10^{-7}$~Hz) for different lattice QCD EoSs, or at larger frequencies for nonvanishing lepton asymmetry using perturbative QCD. Future gravitational wave experiments with high enough sensitivity in the measurement of the amplitude of PGWs like SKA, EPTA, DECIGO and LISA can probe these differences and can shed light on the real nature of the cosmic QCD transition and the existence of a nonvanishing lepton asymmetry in the early universe."

Yet our ability to explore complex, multi-dimensional policy spaces - such as those found in recommendation and ranking problems - is often constrained by the limited number of experiments that can be run simultaneously. To alleviate these constraints, we augment online experiments with an offline simulator and apply multi-task Bayesian optimization to tune live machine learning systems. We describe practical issues that arise in these types of applications, including biases that arise from using a simulator and assumptions for the multi-task kernel. We measure empirical learning curves which show substantial gains from including data from biased offline experiments, and show how these learning curves are consistent with theoretical results for multi-task Gaussian process generalization. We find that improved kernel inference is a significant driver of multi-task generalization. Finally, we show several examples of Bayesian optimization efficiently tuning a live machine learning system by combining offline and online experiments."

Two faster defenders cooperate to protect the target subspace by capturing an attacker which strives to enter the target subspace from the play subspace without being captured. A closed-form solution is provided from the perspectives of kind and degree. Contributions of the work include the use of the attack subspace (AS) method to construct the barrier, by which the game winner can be perfectly predicted before the game starts. In addition to this inclusion, with the priori information about the game result, a critical payoff function is designed when the defenders can win the game. Then, the optimal strategy for each player is explicitly reformulated as a saddle-point equilibrium. Finally, we apply these theoretical results to a half-space guarding game in three-dimensional space. Since the whole achieved developments are analytical, they require a little memory without computational burden and allow for real-time updates, beyond the capacity of traditional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs method. It is worth noting that this is the first time in the current work to consider the target guarding games for arbitrary high-dimensional space, and in a fully analytical form."

The \emph{subsetwise spanner} problem aims to preserve distances in $G$ for only a subset of the vertices. We generalize the minimum-cost subsetwise spanner problem to one where vertices appear on multiple levels, which we call the \emph{multi-level graph spanner} (MLGS) problem, and describe two simple heuristics. Applications of this problem include road/network building and multi-level graph visualization, especially where vertices may require different grades of service.   We formulate a 0--1 integer linear program (ILP) of size $O(|E||V|^2)$ for the more general minimum \emph{pairwise spanner problem}, which resolves an open question by Sigurd and Zachariasen on whether this problem admits a useful polynomial-size ILP. We extend this ILP formulation to the MLGS problem, and evaluate the heuristic and ILP performance on random graphs of up to 100 vertices and 500 edges."

We use the reduced MHD equations to describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles species. We add the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects using a closure relation. The simulations suggest that the helically trapped EP driven by the perpendicular neutral beam injector (NBI) further destabilizes the 1/1 MHD-like mode located at the plasma periphery (r/a = 0.88). If the beta of the EP driven by the perpendicular NBI is larger than 0.0025 a 1/1 EIC with a frequency around 3 kHz is destabilized. If the effect of the passing EP driven by the tangential NBI is included on the model, any enhancement of the injection intensity of the tangential NBI below beta=0.025 leads to a decrease of the instability growth rate. The simulations indicate that the perpendicular NBI EP is the main driver of the EIC events, as it was observed in the experiment. If the effect of the helical couplings are added in the model, an 11/13 EIC is destabilized with a frequency around 9 kHz, inward shifted (r/a = 0.81) compared to the 1/1 EIC. Thus, one possible explanation for the EIC frequency chirping down from 9 to 3 kHz is a transition between the 11/13 to the 1/1 EIC due to a weakening of the destabilizing effect of the high n modes, caused by a decrease of the EP drive due to a loss of helically trapped EP or a change in the EP distribution function after the EIC burst."

We investigate its duality relation to the recently defined John (ellipsoid) function by Alonso-Gutierrez, Merino, Jimenez and Villa. For convex bodies, John and Loewner ellipsoids are dual to each other. Interestingly, this need not be the case for the John function and the Loewner function."

Samples generated by existing techniques for saliency detection cannot handle the noise perturbations smoothly and fail to delineate the salient objects present in the given scene. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end coupled Denoising based Saliency Prediction with Generative Adversarial Network (DSAL-GAN) framework to address the problem of salient object detection in noisy images. DSAL-GAN consists of two generative adversarial-networks (GAN) trained end-to-end to perform denoising and saliency prediction altogether in a holistic manner. The first GAN consists of a generator which denoises the noisy input image, and in the discriminator counterpart we check whether the output is a denoised image or ground truth original image. The second GAN predicts the saliency maps from raw pixels of the input denoised image using a data-driven metric based on saliency prediction method with adversarial loss. Cycle consistency loss is also incorporated to further improve salient region prediction. We demonstrate with comprehensive evaluation that the proposed framework outperforms several baseline saliency models on various performance benchmarks."

The field theoretical description of interacting systems offers a systematic framework to describe the dynamical generation of condensates. Resent findings of a duality between the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model and the nonlinear sigma model enables us to investigate various properties underlying both theories. In this review we mainly focus on inhomogeneous condensations in static situations. The various methods developed in the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model reveal the inhomogeneous phase structures and also yield new inhomogeneous solutions in the nonlinear sigma model owing to the duality. The recent progress on interacting systems in finite systems is also reviewed.

Here we demonstrate that sulphur vacancies are able to engineer sub-band photoresponse into the short-wave infrared range due to formation of in-gap states in Bi2S3 single crystals supported by density functional (DF) calculations. Sulfurization and subsequent refill of the vacancies results in faster response but limits the spectral range to the near infrared as determined by the bandgap of Bi2S3. A facile chemical treatment is then explored to accelerate the speed of sulphur deficient (SD)-based detectors on the order of 10 ms without sacrificing its spectral coverage into the infrared, while holding a high D* close to 10^15 Jones in the visible-near infrared range and 10^12 Jones at 1.6 um. This work also provides new insights into the role sulphur vacancies play on the electronic structure and, as a result, into sub-bandgap photoresponse enabling ultrasensitive, fast and broadband photodetectors."

This requirement may cause communication and computation overhead and necessitates the design of mechanisms that alleviate this bottleneck. We consider a scenario where message transmission can only be performed locally so that the mechanism allocation/tax functions can be calculated in a decentralized manner. Each agent transmits messages to her local neighborhood, as defined by a given message-exchange network, and her allocation/tax functions are only functions of the available neighborhood messages. This scenario gives rise to a novel research problem that we call ""Distributed Mechanism Design"". In this paper, we propose two distributed mechanisms for network utility maximization problems that involve private and public goods with competition and cooperation between agents. As a concrete example, we use the problems of rate allocation in networks with either unicast or multirate multicast transmission protocols. The proposed mechanism for each of the protocols fully implements the optimal allocation in Nash equilibria and its message space dimensionality scales linearly with respect to the number of agents in the network."

With L-band surface sensitivity even better than the planned phase one Square-Kilometer-Array (SKA1), the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) promises unprecedented insights into two of the primary components of ISM, namely, the atomic hydrogen (HI) and the hydroxyl molecule (OH). We discuss here the evolving landscape of our understanding of ISM, particularly, its complex phases, the magnetic fields within, the so-called dark molecular gas (DMG), high velocity clouds, and the connection between local and distant ISM. We lay out, in broad strokes, several expected FAST projects, including an all northern-sky high-resolution HI survey (22,000 deg$^2$, 3\arcmin\ FWHM beam, 0.2 km/s), targeted OH mapping, searching for absorption or masing signals, and etc. Currently under commissioning, the commensal observing mode of FAST will be capable of simultaneously obtaining HI and pulsar data streams, making large-scale surveys in both science areas more efficient."

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that some predicted high-pressure phases of elemental Li also host topological electronic structures. Beginning at 80 GPa and coincident with a transition to the Pbca phase, we find Li to be a Dirac nodal line semimetal. We further calculate that Li retains linearly-dispersive energy bands in subsequent predicted higher pressure phases, and that it exhibits a Lifshitz transition between two Cmca phases at 220 GPa. The Fd-3m phase at 500 GPa forms buckled honeycomb layers that give rise to a Dirac crossing 1 eV below the Fermi energy. The well-isolated topological nodes near the Fermi level in these phases result from increasing p-orbital character with density at the Fermi level, itself a consequence of rising 1s core wavefunction overlap, and a preference for nonsymmorphic symmetries in the crystal structures favored at these pressures. Our results provide evidence that under pressure, bulk 3D materials with light elements, or even pure elemental systems, can undergo topological phase transitions hosting nontrivial topological properties near the Fermi level with measurable consequences; and that, through pressure, we can access these novel phases in elemental lithium."

Within a mesoscale elasto-plastic model accounting for a shear band instability, we show how an additional noise can induce a transition from phase separated to homogeneous flow, accompanied by critical-like fluctuations of the macroscopic shear rate. Both macroscopic quantities and fluctuations exhibit power law behaviors in the vicinity of this transition, consistent with previous experimental findings on vibrated granular media. Altogether, our results suggest a generic scenario for the emergence of criticality when shear weakening mechanisms compete with a fluidizing noise."

Both longitudinal (dissipative) and transverse (Lorentz-type) components of the force are derived in a coherent way and compared in detail with the corresponding expressions available in the literature. This allows us to resolve a controversy about the form of the Lorentz-type force component acting on proton vortices.

Large variation in appearance of the concrete material, changing illumination and weather conditions, a variety of possible surface markings as well as the possibility for different types of defects to overlap, make it a challenging real-world task. In this work we introduce the novel COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage dataset (CODEBRIM) for multi-target classification of five commonly appearing concrete defects. We investigate and compare two reinforcement learning based meta-learning approaches, MetaQNN and efficient neural architecture search, to find suitable convolutional neural network architectures for this challenging multi-class multi-target task.

Tool support for the localization and repair of faults within knowledge bases of such systems can therefore be essential for their practical success. Correspondingly, a number of knowledge base debugging approaches, in particular for ontology-based systems, were proposed throughout recent years. Query-based debugging is a comparably recent interactive approach that localizes the true cause of an observed problem by asking knowledge engineers a series of questions. Concrete implementations of this approach exist, such as the OntoDebug plug-in for the ontology editor Prot\'eg\'e.   To validate that a newly proposed method is favorable over an existing one, researchers often rely on simulation-based comparisons. Such an evaluation approach however has certain limitations and often cannot fully inform us about a method's true usefulness. We therefore conducted different user studies to assess the practical value of query-based ontology debugging. One main insight from the studies is that the considered interactive approach is indeed more efficient than an alternative algorithmic debugging based on test cases. We also observed that users frequently made errors in the process, which highlights the importance of a careful design of the queries that users need to answer."

Many labeled corpora have been extracted from several sources to accomplish this task, and it seems that sarcasm is conveyed in different ways for different domains. Nonetheless, very little work has been done for comparing different methods among the available corpora. Furthermore, usually, each author collects and uses their own datasets to evaluate his own method. In this paper, we show that sarcasm detection can be tackled by applying classical machine learning algorithms to input texts sub-symbolically represented in a Latent Semantic space. The main consequence is that our studies establish both reference datasets and baselines for the sarcasm detection problem that could serve the scientific community to test newly proposed methods."

We consider each scenario as a polyhedron of the mix of first-stage and second-stage decision variables. According to John's theorem, the Lowner-John ellipsoid of each polyhedron will be unique which means that different scenarios will have correspondingly different Lowner-John ellipsoids. By optimizing the objective function regarding both feasible regions of the polyhedron and its unique Lowner-John ellipsoid, respectively, we obtain a pair of optimal values, which would be a coordinate on a two-dimensional plane. The scenarios, whose coordinates are close enough on the plane, will be treated as one scenario; thus our method reduces the sample size of an iid sample considerably. Instead of using a large iid sample directly, we would use the cluster of low-cost computers to calculate the coordinates of a massive number of scenarios and build a representative and significantly smaller sample to feed the solver. We show that our method will obtain the optimal solution of a very large sample without compromising the solution quality. Furthermore, our method would be implementable as a distributed computational infrastructure with many but low-cost computers."

In the famous paper [PTBO1], Pollmann, Tuner, Berg, and Oshikawa introduced ${\mathbb Z}_2$-indices for injective matrix products states (MPS) which have either ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$ dihedral group (of $\pi$-rotations about $x$, $y$, and $z$-axes) symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, or reflection symmetry. The first two are on-site symmetries. In [O4], an index for on-site symmetries, which generalizes the index in [PTBO1], was introduced for general unique gapped ground state phases in quantum spin chains. It was proved that the index is an invariant of the $C^1$-classification of SPT phases. The index for the reflection symmetry, which is not an on-site symmetry, was left as an open question. In this paper, we introduce a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-index for the reflection symmetric unique gapped ground state phases, and complete the generalization problem of index by Pollmann et.al.

Students in DATA Lab engage in the exploration of physical systems to increase their understanding of the experimental process, data analysis, collaboration, and scientific communication. In order to ensure our students are making progress toward the skills outlined in the course learning goals, we designed all of the assessments in the courses to evaluate their progress specific to these laboratory practices. Here, we will describe the structures, scaffolds, goals, and assessments of the course."

Model-independent measurements are therefore worth studying. Time delays measured in lensed quasars provide the time delay distances. When compared with the luminosity distances from Supernova Ia observation, the measurements can provide the curvature information under the Distance Sum Rule of FLRW metric. This method is limited by the low redshifts of SNe Ia. In this work, we propose gravitational waves from the Einstein Telescope as standard sirens which reach higher redshifts covering the redshift range of lensed quasars from Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, could provide much more stringent constraints on the curvature. We first consider a conservative case where only 100 gravitational waves with electromagnetic counterparts are available, the $1\sigma$ uncertainty for the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ is 0.057. In an optimistic case with 1000 signals available, then $\Omega_k$ uncertainty is 0.027. Combining with SNe Ia from Dark Energy Survey, $\Omega_k$ can be further constrained to 0.027 and 0.018, respectively."

If every right invariant subspace of $\mathfrak A$ in the non-commutative Hardy space $H^2$ is of Beurling type, then we say $\mathfrak A$ to be type 1. We determine generators of these algebras and consider a Riesz type factorization theorem for the non-commutative $H^1$ space. We show that the right analytic Toeplitz algebra on the non-commutative Hardy space $H^p$ associated with a type 1 subdiagonal algebra with multiplicity 1 is hereditary reflexive."

Less is known of the behavior of incoherent ST fields that maintain the spatio-temporal spectral structure of their coherent wave-packet counterparts while losing all purely spatial or temporal coherence. We show here that structuring the spatio-temporal spectrum of an incoherent field produces broadband incoherent ST fields that are diffraction-free. The intensity profile of these fields consists of a narrow spatial feature atop a constant background. Spatio-temporal spectral engineering allows controlling the width of this spatial feature, tuning it from a bright to a dark diffraction-free feature, and varying its amplitude relative to the background. These results pave the way to new opportunities in the experimental investigation of optical coherence of fields jointly structured in space and time by exploiting the techniques usually associated with ultrafast optics."

By tuning laser fluence, an epitaxial single-phase nickel oxide thin-film growth can be achieved in a wide range of temperatures from 10 to 750 {\deg}C. At the lowest growth temperature, the out-of-plane strain raises to 1.5%, which is five times bigger than that in a NiO film grown at 750 {\deg}C. MnO thin films that had long-range ordered were successfully deposited on the MgO substrates after appropriate tuning of deposition parameters. The growth of MnO phase was strongly influenced by substrate temperature and laser fluence. EuO films with satisfactory quality were deposited by PLD after oxygen availability had been minimized. Synthesis of EuO thin films at rather low growth temperature prevented thermally-driven lattice relaxation and allowed growth of strained films. Overall, PLD was a quick and reliable method to grow binary oxides with rocksalt structure in high quality that can satisfy requirements for applications and for basic research."
6158,8134,2019-04-03,2019-04-03,physics,3.0,1.0,1904.01793v2,Preference-Informed Fairness,"We study notions of fairness in decision-making systems when individuals have diverse preferences over the possible outcomes of the decisions. Our starting point is the seminal work of Dwork et al. which introduced a notion of individual fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair of individuals who are similarly qualified according to the metric should receive similar outcomes. We show that when individuals have diverse preferences over outcomes, requiring IF may unintentionally lead to less-preferred outcomes for the very individuals that IF aims to protect. A natural alternative to IF is the classic notion of fair division, envy-freeness (EF): no individual should prefer another individual's outcome over their own. Although EF allows for solutions where all individuals receive a highly-preferred outcome, EF may also be overly-restrictive. For instance, if many individuals agree on the best outcome, then if any individual receives this outcome, they all must receive it, regardless of each individual's underlying qualifications for the outcome.   We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual fairness (PIIF) that is a relaxation of both individual fairness and envy-freeness. At a high-level, PIIF requires that outcomes satisfy IF-style constraints, but allows for deviations provided they are in line with individuals' preferences. We show that PIIF can permit outcomes that are more favorable to individuals than any IF solution, while providing considerably more flexibility to the decision-maker than EF. In addition, we show how to efficiently optimize any convex objective over the outcomes subject to PIIF for a rich class of individual preferences. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the PIIF framework by extending our definitions and algorithms to the multiple-task targeted advertising setting introduced by Dwork and Ilvento."

However, most previous methods focus on learning individual appearance feature embedding, and it is hard for the models to handle difficult situations with different illumination, large pose variance and occlusion. In this work, we take a step further and consider employing context information for person search. For a probe-gallery pair, we first propose a contextual instance expansion module, which employs a relative attention module to search and filter useful context information in the scene. We also build a graph learning framework to effectively employ context pairs to update target similarity. These two modules are built on top of a joint detection and instance feature learning framework, which improves the discriminativeness of the learned features. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used person search datasets."

Our knowledge about the unknown multivariate function is in terms of finitely many moments of the Young measure supported on the graph of the function. Such an input is available when approximating weak (or measure-valued) solution of optimal control problems, entropy solutions to non-linear hyperbolic PDEs, or using numerical integration from finitely many evaluations of the function. While most of the existing methods construct a piecewise polynomial approximation, we construct a semi-algebraic approximation whose estimation and evaluation can be performed efficiently. An appealing feature of this method is that it deals with non-smoothness implicitly so that a single scheme can be used to treat smooth or non-smooth functions without any prior knowledge. On the theoretical side, we prove pointwise convergence almost everywhere as well as convergence in the Lebesgue one norm under broad assumptions. Using more restrictive assumptions, we obtain explicit convergence rates. We illustrate our approach on various examples from control and approximation. In particular we observe empirically that our method does not suffer from the the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous functions."

Using this pseudotoric technique we explain how non standard lagrangian tori of Chekanov type can be constructed and what is the topological difference between standard Liouville tori and the non standard ones. However we have not discussed the natural question about the periods of the constructed twist tori; in particular the monotonicity problem for the monotonic case was not studied there. In the paper we present several remarks on these questions, in particular we show for the monotonic case how to construct non standard lagrangian tori which satisify the monotonicity condition. First of all we study non standard tori which are Bohr - Sommerfeld with respect to the anticanonical class. This notion was introduced in [2], where one defines certain universal Maslov class for the ${\rm BS}_{can}$ lagrangian submanifolds in compact simply connected monotonic symplectic manifolds. Then we show how monotonic non standard lagrangian tori of Chekanov type can be constructed. Furthemore we extend the consideration to pseudotoric setup and construct examples of monotonic lagrangian tori in non toric monotonic manifolds: complex 4 - dimensional quadric and full flag variety $F^3$."

The proof requires two steps: a dynamical approach is first used to construct stationary solutions under the additional assumption that the coagulation kernel and the overall fragmentation rate are bounded from below by a positive constant. The general case is then handled by a compactness argument."

In the model considered in this paper, the malicious agent attacks an input (output) by manipulating its value arbitrarily, i.e., we impose no constraints (statistical or otherwise) on how control commands (sensor measurements) are changed by the adversary. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse strong observability and we show that is a necessary and sufficient condition for correctly reconstructing the state despite the considered attacks. In the second half of this work, we propose an estimator to harness the complexity of this intrinsically combinatorial problem, by leveraging satisfiability modulo theory solving. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our estimator."

Let us denote $d$ the dimension of $a_\Theta$, i.e the cardinal of $\Delta - \Theta$ and $\Sigma_{\Theta}$ the set of all non-trivial projections of roots in $\Sigma$.

However, most of the recent deep learning based methods neglect the semantic structure of fine-grained objects and do not take advantage of the traditional fine-grained recognition techniques (e.g. coarse-to-fine classification). In this paper, we propose a novel framework with a two-branch network (coarse branch and fine branch), i.e., semantic bilinear pooling, for fine-grained recognition with a hierarchical label tree. This framework can adaptively learn the semantic information from the hierarchical levels. Specifically, we design a generalized cross-entropy loss for the training of the proposed framework to fully exploit the semantic priors via considering the relevance between adjacent levels and enlarge the distance between samples of different coarse classes. Furthermore, our method leverages only the fine branch when testing so that it adds no overhead to the testing time. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets."

A brief review of classical mathematical programming techniques for hedging against uncertainty is first presented, along with their wide spectrum of applications in Process Systems Engineering. A comprehensive review and classification of the relevant publications on data-driven distributionally robust optimization, data-driven chance constrained program, data-driven robust optimization, and data-driven scenario-based optimization is then presented. This paper also identifies fertile avenues for future research that focuses on a closed-loop data-driven optimization framework, which allows the feedback from mathematical programming to machine learning, as well as scenario-based optimization leveraging the power of deep learning techniques. Perspectives on online learning-based data-driven multistage optimization with a learning-while-optimizing scheme is presented."

We define $\alpha=a/b, ~\beta_n {=}b\sqrt{2m U_n}/\hbar$, we find $\beta_n$ values for which critically the well has $n$-node half bound state at $E{=}0$. Consequently, this fixed well has $n$ number of bound states. Also we obtain a semi-classical expression ${\cal G}(\alpha,\beta)$ such that the Fermi well has either $[\cal G]$ or $[{\cal G}]+1$ number of bound states. Here $[.]$ indicates the integer part. We also confirm the consistency of $\cal G$ with the number of s-wave neutron energy levels in a central ($x\in (0,\infty))$ Fermi potential well."

These are symmetries of the quark - chromo-electric interaction and include chiral symmetries as subgroups. Hence the quark - chromo-magnetic interaction, which breaks both symmetries, is located at least predominantly in the near - zero modes. Using as a tool the expansion of propagators into eigenmodes of the Dirac operator we here analytically study effects of a gap in the eigenmode spectrum on baryon correlators. We find that both $U(1)_A$ and $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ emerge automatically if there is a gap around zero. Emergence of larger $SU(2)_{CS}$ and $SU(4)$ symmetries requires in addition a microscopical dynamical input about the higher-lying modes and their symmetry structure."

D$^2$-City contains more than 10000 video clips which deeply reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world traffic scenarios in China. We also provide bounding boxes and tracking annotations of 12 classes of objects in all frames of 1000 videos and detection annotations on keyframes for the remainder of the videos. Compared with existing datasets, D$^2$-City features data in varying weather, road, and traffic conditions and a huge amount of elaborate detection and tracking annotations. By bringing a diverse set of challenging cases to the community, we expect the D$^2$-City dataset will advance the perception and related areas of intelligent driving."

We analytically calculate time evolutions of wave function, density matrix and entanglement of the system. We find that initially entangled two qubits may alternatively transfer their entanglement entropy to other two qubit pairs. So that dynamical evolution of three interacting qubits may produce a genuine three-partite entangled state through entanglement entropy transfers. In particular, different pairwise interactions of the three qubits endow symmetric and asymmetric evolutions of the entanglement transfer, characterized by the quantum mutual information and concurence. Finally, we discuss an experimental proposal of three Rydberg atoms for testing the entanglement dynamics transfer of this kind."

We first reinterpret color-magnitude and color-color diagrams using photometric and spectroscopic information contained in the Montreal White Dwarf Database (MWDD), combined with synthetic magnitudes calculated from a self-consistent set of model atmospheres with various atmospheric compositions. The same models are then applied to measure the fundamental parameters of white dwarfs using the so-called photometric technique, which relies on the exquisite Gaia trigonometric parallax measurements, and photometric data from Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and Gaia. In particular, we discuss at length the systematic effects induced by these various photometric systems. We then study in great detail the mass distribution as a function of effective temperature for the white dwarfs spectroscopically identified in the MWDD, as well as for the white dwarf candidates discovered by Gaia. We pay particular attention to the assumed atmospheric chemical composition of cool, non-DA stars. We also briefly revisit the validity of the mass-radius relation for white dwarfs, and the recent discovery of the signature of crystallization in the Gaia color-magnitude diagram for DA white dwarfs. We finally present evidence that the core composition of most of these white dwarfs is, in bulk, a mixture of carbon and oxygen, an expected result from stellar evolution theory, but never empirically well established before."

Bi-secondary structures were introduced by Haslinger and Stadler and are pairs of RNA secondary structures, i.e. diagrams having non-crossing arcs in the upper half-plane. A bi-secondary structure is represented by drawing its respective secondary structures in the upper and lower half-plane. An RNA secondary structure has a loop decomposition, where a loop corresponds to a boundary component, regarding the secondary structure as an orientable fatgraph. The loop-decomposition of secondary structures facilitates the computation of its free energy and any two loops intersect either trivially or in exactly two vertices. In bi-secondary structures the intersection of loops is more complex and is of importance in current algorithmic work in bio-informatics and evolutionary optimization. We shall construct a simplicial complex capturing the intersections of loops and compute its homology. We prove that only the zeroth and second homology groups are nontrivial and furthermore show that the second homology group is free. Finally, we provide evidence that the generators of the second homology group have a bio-physical interpretation: they correspond to pairs of mutually exclusive substructures."

This information can be extracted from Open Source Intelligence published daily by users, security organisations, and researchers. In particular, Twitter has become an information hub for obtaining cutting-edge information about many subjects, including cybersecurity. This work proposes SYNAPSE, a Twitter-based streaming threat monitor that generates a continuously updated summary of the threat landscape related to a monitored infrastructure. Its tweet-processing pipeline is composed of filtering, feature extraction, binary classification, an innovative clustering strategy, and generation of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). A quantitative evaluation considering all tweets from 80 accounts over more than 8 months (over 195.000 tweets), shows that our approach timely and successfully finds the majority of security-related tweets concerning an example IT infrastructure (true positive rate above 90%), incorrectly selects a small number of tweets as relevant (false positive rate under 10%), and summarises the results to very few IoCs per day. A qualitative evaluation of the IoCs generated by SYNAPSE demonstrates their relevance (based on the CVSS score and the availability of patches or exploits), and timeliness (based on threat disclosure dates from NVD)."

The interplay between the viscoelastic rheology with inertia, elasto-plasticity, and unidirectional rate-dependent incomplete damage affecting both the elastic and viscous response, as well as the plastic yield stress, is rigorously characterized by showing existence of weak solutions to the constitutive and balance equations of the model. The analysis relies on the notions of plastic-strain measures and bounded-deformation displacements, on sophisticated time-regularity estimates to establish a duality between acceleration and velocity of the elastic displacement, on the theory of rate-independent processes for the energy conservation in the dynamical-plastic part, and on the proof of the strong convergence of the elastic strains. Existence of a suitably defined weak solutions is proved rather constructively by using a staggered two-step time discretization scheme."

We developed a new diagnostics, the topographical fluctuations analysis (TFA) to study the spectrum of fluctuations in the various regions around a reconnection site. We find that fluctuations belong to two very different regimes. The first regime is better known, it develops in the reconnection outflows and is characterized by a strong link between plasma and electromagnetic fluctuations leading to momentum and energy exchanges via anomalous viscosity and resistivity. But there is a second, new, regime: it develops in the inflow and in the region around the separatrix surfaces, including the reconnection diffusion region itself. In this new regime the plasma remains laminar but the electromagnetic fields fluctuates strongly. We present an analogy with the smooth continuous motion of the bow of a violin producing the vibrations of the strings to emit music."

For angular velocity estimation, honeybees show large spatial-independence against visual stimuli, whereas the previous models have not fulfilled such an ability. To address this issue, we propose a bio-plausible model for estimating the image motion velocity based on behavioural experiments of the honeybee flying through patterned tunnels. The proposed model contains mainly three parts, the texture estimation layer for spatial information extraction, the delay-and-correlate layer for temporal information extraction and the decoding layer for angular velocity estimation. This model produces responses that are largely independent of the spatial frequency in grating experiments. And the model has been implemented in a virtual bee for tunnel centring simulations. The results coincide with both electro-physiological neuron spike and behavioural path recordings, which indicates our proposed method provides a better explanation of the honeybee's image motion detection mechanism guiding the tunnel centring behaviour."

CMB constraints on GWs are usually characterized as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, assuming specifically a power-law form of the primordial spectrum, and are obtained from the angular spectra of CMB. Here, we relax the assumption of the power-law form, and consider to what extent one can constrain a monochromatic GW at shorter wavelengths. Previously, such a constraint has been derived at the wavelengths larger than the resolution scale of the CMB measurements, typically above $100$Mpc (below $10^{-16}$Hz in frequency). However, GWs whose wavelength is much shorter than $100$Mpc can imprint a small but non-negligible signal on CMB anisotropies at observed angular scales, $\ell<1000$. Here, using the CMB temperature, polarization, and lensing data set, we obtain the best constraints to date at $10^{-16}-10^{-14}$Hz of the GWs produced before the time of decoupling, which are tighter than those derived from the astrometric measurements and upper bounds on extra radiations. In the future, the constraints on GWs at Mpc scales will be further improved by several orders of magnitude with the precision $B$-mode measurement on large scales, $\ell<100$."

However, co-natal stars should be present throughout the Galaxy, and their demographics can shed light on the clustered nature of star formation and the dynamical state of the disk. In previous work we presented a set of simulations of the Galactic disk that followed the clustered formation and dynamical evolution of 4 billion individual stars over the last 5 Gyr. The simulations predict that a high fraction of co-moving stars with physical and 3D velocity separation of $\Delta r < 20$ pc and $\Delta v < 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ are co-natal. In this \textit{Letter}, we use \textit{Gaia} DR2 and LAMOST DR4 data to identify and study co-moving pairs. We find that the distribution of relative velocities and separations of pairs in the data is in good agreement with the predictions from the simulation. We identify 111 co-moving pairs in the Solar neighborhood with reliable astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. These pairs show a strong preference for having similar metallicities when compared to random field pairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born together. The simulations predict that co-natal pairs originate preferentially from high-mass and relatively young ($< 1$ Gyr) star clusters. \textit{Gaia} will eventually deliver well-determined metallicities for the brightest stars, enabling the identification of thousands of co-natal pairs due to disrupting star clusters in the solar neighborhood."

In this paper, we argue that the effect of interactions on one-magnon states can, under many circumstances, be treated in terms of an effective, energy independent, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the magnons. In the vicinity of Dirac or Weyl touching points, we show that the spectral function has a characteristic anisotropy arising from topologically protected exceptional points or lines in the non-Hermitian spectrum. Such features can, in principle, be detected using inelastic neutron scattering or other spectroscopic probes. We illustrate this physics through a concrete example: a honeycomb ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange. We perform interacting spin wave calculations of the structure factor and spectral function of this model, showing good agreement with results from a simple effective non-Hermitian model for the splitting of the Dirac point. Finally, we argue that the zoo of known topological protected magnon band structures may serve as a nearly ideal platform for realizing and exploring non-Hermitian physics in solid-state systems."

The cooling time scale for the hot virialized halo gas is too long to provide the source of cold gas. Supersonic, cold streams have been invoked as a mechanism for feeding massive halos at high redshift and deliver the cold gas required for continued star formation at the rates observed. This mechanism for replenishing the cold gas reservoir is motivated by some cosmological simulations. However, the cold streams are likely to be subject to the supersonic version of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which eventually leads to stream disruption. Cosmological simulations have yet to obtain the spatial resolution required for understanding the detailed stability properties of cold streams. In this paper, we consider instead an idealized model of magnetized cold streams that we spatially resolve. Using linear theory we show how magnetic fields with dynamically important field strengths do not inhibit the KHI but rather enhance its growth rate. We perform nonlinear simulations of magnetized stream disruption and find that magnetic fields can nevertheless increase stream survival times by suppressing the mixing rate of cold gas with the circumgalactic medium. We find that magnetic fields can allow streams to survive $\sim 2-8$ times longer and, consequently, that streams $\sim 2-8$ times thinner can reach the central galaxy if the magnetic field strength is $\sim 0.3-0.8 \mu$G."

In quantum theory however, such well-defined trajectories are forbidden. After introducing a general characterisation of quantum clocks, we demonstrate that, in the weak-field, low-velocity limit, all ""good"" quantum clocks experience time dilation as dictated by general relativity when their state of motion is classical (i.e. Gaussian). For nonclassical states of motion, on the other hand, we find that quantum interference effects may give rise to a significant discrepancy between the proper time and the time measured by the clock. The universality of this discrepancy implies that it is not simply a systematic error, but rather a quantum modification to the proper time itself. We also show how the clock's delocalisation leads to a larger uncertainty in the time it measures --- a consequence of the unavoidable entanglement between the clock time and its center-of-mass degrees of freedom. We demonstrate how this lost precision can be recovered by performing a measurement of the clock's state of motion alongside its time reading."

Quantum Machine Learning is touted as a potential utilisation of such devices, particularly those which are out of the reach of the simulation capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we propose a generative Quantum Machine Learning Model, called the Ising Born Machine (IBM), which we show cannot, in the worst case, and up to suitable notions of error, be simulated efficiently by a classical device. We also show this holds for all the circuit families encountered during training. In particular, we explore quantum circuit learning using non-universal circuits derived from Ising Model Hamiltonians, which are implementable on near term quantum devices.   We propose two novel training methods for the IBM by utilising the Stein Discrepancy and the Sinkhorn Divergence cost functions. We show numerically, both using a simulator within Rigetti's Forest platform and on the Aspen-1 16Q chip, that the cost functions we suggest outperform the more commonly used Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for differentiable training. We also propose an improvement to the MMD by proposing a novel utilisation of quantum kernels which we demonstrate provides improvements over its classical counterpart. We discuss the potential of these methods to learn `hard' quantum distributions, a feat which would demonstrate the advantage of quantum over classical computers, and provide the first formal definitions for what we call `Quantum Learning Supremacy'. Finally, we propose a novel view on the area of quantum circuit compilation by using the IBM to `mimic' target quantum circuits using classical output data only."

Although only dealing with simple questions, i.e., questions that can be answered through a single knowledge base (KB) fact, this task is neither simple nor close to being solved. Targeting on the two main steps, subgraph selection and fact selection, the research community has developed sophisticated approaches. However, the importance of subgraph ranking and leveraging the subject--relation dependency of a KB fact have not been sufficiently explored. Motivated by this, we present a unified framework to describe and analyze existing approaches. Using this framework as a starting point, we focus on two aspects: improving subgraph selection through a novel ranking method and leveraging the subject--relation dependency by proposing a joint scoring CNN model with a novel loss function that enforces the well-order of scores. Our methods achieve a new state of the art (85.44% in accuracy) on the SimpleQuestions dataset."

Ignoring the intentions of the other agents in dynamic environments can lead to risky or over-conservative plans. In this work, we model the motion planning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose an online system that combines an intent recognition algorithm and a POMDP solver to generate risk-bounded plans for the ego vehicle navigating with a number of dynamic agent vehicles. The intent recognition algorithm predicts the probabilistic hybrid motion states of each agent vehicle over a finite horizon using Bayesian filtering and a library of pre-learned maneuver motion models. We update the POMDP model with the intent recognition results in real time and solve it using a heuristic search algorithm which produces policies with upper-bound guarantees on the probability of near colliding with other dynamic agents. We demonstrate that our system is able to generate better motion plans in terms of efficiency and safety in a number of challenging environments including unprotected intersection left turns and lane changes as compared to the baseline methods."

However, this approach does not fully address the mutual dependencies of low- and high-resolution images. We propose Deep Back-Projection Networks (DBPN), the winner of two image super-resolution challenges (NTIRE2018 and PIRM2018), that exploit iterative up- and down-sampling layers. These layers are formed as a unit providing an error feedback mechanism for projection errors. We construct mutually-connected up- and down-sampling units each of which represents different types of image degradation and high-resolution components. We also show that extending this idea to several variants applying the latest deep network trends, such as recurrent network, dense connection, and residual learning, to improve the performance.

Both SVWN and B3LYP exchange-correlation functionals are employed in a two-stage density functional theory (DFT) calculations to generate these clusters. In the first stage, a minimum energy cluster structure is generated by an unbiased global search algorithm coupled with a DFT code using a light exchange-correlation functional and small basis sets. In the second stage, the obtained cluster structure is further optimized by another round of global minimization search coupled with a DFT calculator using a heavier exchange-correlation functional and more costly basis set. Electronic properties of the structures are illustrated in the form of a ternary diagram. Our DFT calculations find that the stability of the clusters increases with the increment in the number of constituent nickel atoms. These results provide a new insight to the structure, stability, chemical order and electronic properties for the ternary alloy nanoclusters."

We compare different varieties of interaction in story-writing, story-planning, and diversity controls under time constraints, and show that increased types of human collaboration at both planning and writing stages results in a 10-50% improvement in story quality as compared to less interactive baselines. We also show an accompanying increase in user engagement and satisfaction with stories as compared to our own less interactive systems and to previous turn-taking approaches to interaction.

In order to make the non-Bayesian social learning model more applicable to human and animal societies, this paper extended this model by assuming the existence of private signal structure bias. Each social member in each time step uses an imperfect signal knowledge to form its Bayesian part belief and then incorporates its neighbors' beliefs into this Bayesian part belief to form a new belief report. First, we investigated the intrinsic learning ability of an isolated agent and deduced the conditions that the signal structure needs to satisfy for this isolated agent to make an eventually correct decision. According to these conditions, agents' signal structures were further divided into three different types, ""conservative,"" ""radical,"" and ""negative."" Then, we switched the context from isolated agents to a connected network; our propositions and simulations show that the conservative agents are the dominant force for the social network to learn the real state, while the other two types might prevent the network from successful learning. Although fragilities do exist in non-Bayesian social learning mechanism, ""be more conservative"" and ""avoid overconfidence"" could be effective strategies for each agent in the real social networks to collectively improve social learning processes and results."

To mollify this problem, we propose regressing word embeddings (ReWE) as a new regularization technique in a system that is jointly trained to predict the next word in the translation (categorical value) and its word embedding (continuous value). Such a joint training allows the proposed system to learn the distributional properties represented by the word embeddings, empirically improving the generalization to unseen sentences. Experiments over three translation datasets have showed a consistent improvement over a strong baseline, ranging between 0.91 and 2.54 BLEU points, and also a marked improvement over a state-of-the-art system."

The motivation is driven by expected lower thermal conductivity and the recent discovery of CoZrBi-based materials. Significantly, our calculated power factor values of all the systems show an increment of $\sim$40\% in comparison to the reported \textit{p}-type CoTiSb. We propose that doping at Bi-site, on account of electronic features, will be helpful in achieving the proposed power factor values. Interestingly, the thermal conductivity of CoTiBi and CoZrBi was found to be lower and that of CoHfBi was almost parallel, in comparison to the reported CoTiSb. We also provide conservative estimates of the figure of merit, exceeding the reported CoTiSb and comparable to FeNbSb. Overall, our results suggest potential new candidates of bismuth-based ternary compounds for high thermoelectric performance."

When physical disabilities bottleneck the natural modality of performing a task, acquisition of ample training data is difficult which practically obstructs classifier training. Previous works have tackled this problem by generalizing the feature space amongst multiple subjects including the test subject. This work aims at knowledge transfer to classify EEG of the target subject using a classifier trained with the EEG of another unit source subject. A many-objective optimization framework is proposed where optimal weights are obtained for projecting features in another dimension such that single source-trained target EEG classification performance is maximized with the modified features. To validate the approach, motor imagery tasks from the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa are classified using power spectral density based features and linear support vector machine. Several performance metrics, improvement in accuracy, sensitivity to the dimension of the projected space, assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. Addressing single-source training promotes independent living of differently-abled individuals by reducing assistance from others. The proposed approach eliminates the requirement of EEG from multiple source subjects and is applicable to any existing feature extractors and classifiers.

Our results are then applied to two specific models reproducing the cosmological background dynamics obtained in group field theory and in loop quantum cosmology, and we discuss the possibility of using this framework as providing an effective field theory description of quantum gravity. We study the evolution of anisotropies near the bounce, and discuss instabilities of scalar perturbations.

In this work, motivated by recent experiments on cubic heavy fermion materials with multipolar local moments, we theoretically investigate strongly-interacting spin-orbital entangled quantum ground states in multipolar quantum impurity systems. Here itinerant electrons are interacting with the local moments carrying quadrupolar and octupolar moments, in contrast to the conventional Kondo problem with dipolar local moment. Using perturbative renormalization group methods, we uncover a number of non-Fermi liquid ground states, which are characterized by an absence of well-defined quasiparticles and singular power-law behaviours in physical properties. We show that the non-Fermi liquid states found here are outside the known categories of non-Fermi liquid states in the conventional multi-channel Kondo problem. This work lays a novel ground for the identification of unexpected non-Fermi liquid phases in many strongly spin-orbital-coupled quantum materials."

We test this theory by propagating particles in realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of ultra-relativistic jets and find that about $10\%$ of the CRs entering the jet are boosted by at least a factor of $\sim\Gamma^2$ in energy, where $\Gamma$ is the jet's effective Lorentz factor, in agreement with the analytical expectations. Furthermore, about $0.1\%$ of the CRs undergo two or more shots and achieve boosts well in excess of $\Gamma^2$. Particles are typically accelerated up to the Hillas limit, suggesting that the $\textit{espresso}$ mechanism may promote galactic-like CRs to UHECRs even in AGN jets with moderate Lorentz factors, and not in powerful blazars only. Finally, we find that the sign of the toroidal magnetic field in the jet and in the cocoon controls the angular distribution of the reaccelerated particles, leading to a UHECR emission that may be either quasi-isotropic or beamed along the jet axis. These findings strongly support the idea that $\textit{espresso}$ acceleration in AGN jets can account for the UHECR spectra, chemical composition, and arrival directions measured by Auger and Telescope Array."

A new non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) transmission protocol that incorporates orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is proposed. Thereby, users with different mobility profiles are grouped together for the implementation of NOMA. The proposed OTFS-NOMA protocol is shown to be applicable to both uplink and downlink transmission, where sophisticated transmit and receive strategies are developed to remove inter-symbol interference and harvest both multi-path and multi-user diversity. Analytical results demonstrate that both the high-mobility and low-mobility users benefit from the application of OTFS-NOMA. In particular, the use of NOMA allows the spreading of the high-mobility users' signals over a large amount of time-frequency resources, which enhances the OTFS resolution and improves the detection reliability. In addition, OTFS-NOMA ensures that low-mobility users have access to bandwidth resources which in conventional OTFS-orthogonal multiple access (OTFS-NOMA) would be solely occupied by the high-mobility users. Thus, OTFS-NOMA improves the spectral efficiency and reduces latency."

Human evaluation captures quality but not diversity, as it does not catch models that simply plagiarize from the training set. On the other hand, statistical evaluation (i.e., perplexity) captures diversity but not quality, as models that occasionally emit low quality samples would be insufficiently penalized. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which evaluates both diversity and quality, based on the optimal error rate of predicting whether a sentence is human- or machine-generated. We demonstrate that this error rate can be efficiently estimated by combining human and statistical evaluation, using an evaluation metric which we call HUSE. On summarization and chit-chat dialogue, we show that (i) HUSE detects diversity defects which fool pure human evaluation and that (ii) techniques such as annealing for improving quality actually decrease HUSE due to decreased diversity."

A neural network to learn correlation between extinction spectra of electric and magnetic dipoles and core-shell nanoparticle designs, which include material information and shell thicknesses, is developed and trained. We demonstrate deep-learning-assisted inverse design of core-shell nanoparticle for 1) spectral tuning electric dipole resonances, 2) finding spectrally isolated pure magnetic dipole resonances, and 3) finding spectrally overlapped electric dipole and magnetic dipole resonances.

To simultaneously exploit the spatial and temporal information of videos, employing 3-dimensional (3D) convolutions is a natural approach. However, straight utilizing 3D convolutions may lead to an excessively high computational complexity which restricts the depth of video SR models and thus undermine the performance. In this paper, we present a novel fast spatio-temporal residual network (FSTRN) to adopt 3D convolutions for the video SR task in order to enhance the performance while maintaining a low computational load. Specifically, we propose a fast spatio-temporal residual block (FRB) that divide each 3D filter to the product of two 3D filters, which have considerably lower dimensions. Furthermore, we design a cross-space residual learning that directly links the low-resolution space and the high-resolution space, which can greatly relieve the computational burden on the feature fusion and up-scaling parts. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods."

This surface separates null geodesics approaching us from those receding, and as free-falling observers within the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, we see it retreating at proper speed c, giving rise to the eponymously named cosmological model R_h=ct. As of today, this cosmology has passed over 25 observational tests, often better than LCDM. The gravitational/Hubble radius R_h therefore appears to be highly relevant to cosmological theory, and in this paper we begin to explore its impact on fundamental physics. We calculate the binding energy of a mass m within the horizon and demonstrate that it is equal to mc^2. This energy is stored when the particle is at rest near the observer, transitioning to a purely kinetic form equal to the particle's escape energy when it approaches R_h. In other words, a particle's gravitational coupling to that portion of the Universe with which it is causally connected appears to be the origin of rest-mass energy."

Lett. A 197, 209 (1995)] derived the expressions for the single-particle distribution functions (known as the phenomenological Tsallis distributions) for particles obeying the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistics using the factorization approximation. In spite of the fact that this paper was published long time ago, its results are still extensively used in many fields of physics, and it is considered that it was this paper that established the connection between the phenomenological Tsallis distributions and the Tsallis statistics. Here we show that this result is incorrect: the mistake lies in the fact that the probability distribution function was derived using the definition of the generalized expectation values (of the Tsallis-2 statistics), but the single-particle distribution function was calculated from this probability distribution using the standard definition of the expectation values of the Tsallis normalized (or Tsallis-1) statistics. Considering the definition of the expectation values which is consistent with the Tsallis-2 formulation, we have proved that the single-particle (classical and quantum) distribution functions in the factorization approximation differ from the phenomenological Tsallis distributions."

We implement this self-energy (plus charge density) self-consistent DFT+DMFT scheme in a basis of maximally localized Wannier orbitals using Wien2K, wien2wannier, and the DMFT impurity solver w2dynamics. As a testbed material we apply the method to SrVO$_3$ and report a significant improvement as compared to previous $d$+$p$ calculations. In particular the position of the oxygen $p$ bands is reproduced correctly, which has been a persistent hassle with unwelcome consequences for the $d$-$p$ hybridization and correlation strength.

Motivated by the results of [1] and [2, 3] who found different behavior in the complexity of free bosons and fermions, in any dimension, we consider the 1+1 dimensional case where, thanks to the bosonisation equivalence, we can consider the same state from both the bosonic and the fermionic perspectives. In this way the discrepancy can be attributed to a different choice of the set of gates allowed in the circuit. We study the effect in two classes of states: i) bosonic-coherent / fermionic-gaussian states; ii) states that are both bosonic- and fermionic-gaussian. We consider the complexity relative to the ground state. In the first class, the different results can be reconciled admitting a mode-dependent cost function in one of the descriptions. The differences in the second class are more important, in terms of the cutoff-dependence and the overall behavior of the complexity."

The system under consideration is a biphasic system consisting of domains of a dispersed phase closely packed together in a continuous phase and separated by thin interfaces. Such system is elastic and typically out of equilibrium. The equilibrium state is attained via the coarsening dynamics, wherein the dispersed phase slowly diffuses through the interfaces, causing domains to change in size and eventually rearrange abruptly. The effect of rearrangements is propagated throughout the system via the intrinsic elastic interactions and may cause rearrangements elsewhere, resulting in intermittent bursts of activity and avalanche behaviour. Here we aim at quantitatively characterizing the corresponding avalanche statistics (i.e. size, duration, inter-avalanche time). Despite the coarsening dynamics is triggered by an internal driving mechanism, we find quantitative indications that such avalanche statistics displays scaling-laws very similar to those observed in the response of disordered materials to external loads."

As opposed to previous works, in which the number of speakers is assumed to be known in advance and speech separation models are specific for the number of speakers, our proposed method can be applied to cases with different numbers of speakers using a single model by recursively separating a speaker. To make the separation model recursively applicable, we propose one-and-rest permutation invariant training (OR-PIT). Evaluation on WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix datasets show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for two- and three-speaker mixtures with a single model. Moreover, the same model can separate four-speaker mixture, which was never seen during the training. We further propose the detection of the number of speakers in a mixture during recursive separation and show that this approach can more accurately estimate the number of speakers than detection in advance by using a deep neural network based classifier."

Pre-processing steps were performed in both approaches for removing hair and dark borders of microscopic images. The Evaluation of the proposed approaches was performed using Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union or IoU). An additional contribution of this paper is to present pipelines for performing pre-processing and segmentation applying existing segmentation and morphological algorithms which led to promising results.

As obtaining the full annotation of videos for action segmentation is expensive, weakly supervised approaches that can learn only from transcripts are appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel, end-to-end approach for weakly supervised action segmentation based on a two-branch neural network. The two branches of our network predict two redundant but different representations for action segmentation. We propose a novel mutual consistency (MuCon) loss that enforces the consistency of the two redundant representations. Using MuCon loss together with a loss for transcript prediction, our proposed approach achieves performance statistically comparable to the state-of-the-art while being 14 times faster to train and 20 times faster during inference."

Thereby, here we report a theoretical and experimental investigation of the magnetic properties and anomalous Nernst effect in a flexible magnetostrictive film with induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and under external stress. Specifically, we calculate the magnetization behavior and the thermoelectric voltage response from a theoretical approach for a planar geometry and with a magnetic free energy density which takes into account the induced uniaxial and magnetoelastic anisotropy contributions. Experimentally, we verify modifications of the effective magnetic anisotropy and thermoelectric voltage with the stress and explore the possibility of tailoring the anomalous Nernst effect in a flexible magnetostrictive film by modifying both, the magnetic field and external stress. We find quantitative agreement between experiment and numerical calculations, thus elucidating the magnetic and thermoelectric voltage behaviors, as well as providing evidence to confirm the validity of the theoretical approach to describe the magnetic properties and anomalous Nernst effect in ferromagnetic magnetostrictive films having uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and submitted to external stress. Hence, the results place flexible magnetostrictive systems as a promising candidate for active elements in functionalized touch electronic devices."

Using a pre-learned universal NMF dictionary, RT-GCC-NMF operates in a frame-by-frame fashion by associating individual dictionary atoms to target speech or background interference based on their estimated time-delay of arrivals (TDOA). We evaluate RT-GCC-NMF on two-channel mixtures of speech and real-world noise from the Signal Separation and Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC). We demonstrate that this approach generalizes to new speakers, acoustic environments, and recording setups from very little training data, and outperforms all but one of the algorithms from the SiSEC challenge in terms of overall Perceptual Evaluation methods for Audio Source Separation (PEASS) scores and compares favourably to the ideal binary mask baseline. Over a wide range of input SNRs, we show that this approach simultaneously improves the PEASS and signal to noise ratio (SNR)-based Blind Source Separation (BSS) Eval objective quality metrics as well as the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and extended STOI (ESTOI) objective speech intelligibility metrics. A flexible, soft masking function in the space of NMF activation coefficients offers real-time control of the trade-off between interference suppression and target speaker fidelity. Finally, we use an asymmetric short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to reduce the inherent algorithmic latency of RT-GCC-NMF from 64 ms to 2 ms with no loss in performance. We demonstrate that latencies within the tolerable range for hearing aids are possible on current hardware platforms."

By investigating the quench dynamics of the isolated quantum spherical $p$-spin model, a paradigmatic model of a mean-field glass, we aim to shed new light on this complex problem. Employing a closed-time Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism, we first initialise the system in a random, infinite-temperature configuration and allow it to equilibrate in contact with a thermal bath before switching off the bath and performing a quench. We find evidence that increasing the strength of either the interactions or the quantum fluctuations can act to lower the effective temperature of the isolated system and stabilise glassy behaviour."

Based on this finding, we analyze differences between embeddings used by these systems in regard to their capability of handling such cases. Furthermore, we argue that intensifiers in context of emotion words need special treatment, as is established for sentiment polarity classification, but not for more fine-grained emotion prediction. To resolve this issue, we analyze different aspects of a post-processing pipeline which enriches the word representations of such phrases. This includes expansion of semantic spaces at the phrase level and sub-word level followed by retrofitting to emotion lexica. We evaluate the impact of these steps with A La Carte and Bag-of-Substrings extensions based on pretrained GloVe, Word2vec, and fastText embeddings against a crowd-sourced corpus of intensity annotations for tweets containing our focus phrases. We show that the fastText-based models do not gain from handling these specific phrases under inspection. For Word2vec embeddings, we show that our post-processing pipeline improves the results by up to 8% on a novel dataset densely populated with intensifiers."

The study questions the validity and applicability of the statistical theory of PPV space fluctuations formulated in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000, LP00) to HI gas and concludes that $""${\it a significant reassessment of many observational and theoretical studies of turbulence in HI}$""$. This implies that dozens of papers that used LP00 theory to explore interstellar turbulence as well as the ongoing research based on LP00 theory are in error. This situation motivates the urgency of our public response. In our Comment we explain why we believe the criticism in CX19 is based on the incorrect understanding of the LP00 theory. In particular, we illustrate that the correlation between PPV slices and dust emissions in CX19 does not properly reveal the relative importance of velocity and density fluctuations in velocity channel maps. While CX19 provides an explanation of the change of the spectral index with respect to the thickness of PPV slice based on the two-phase nature of H1 gas, we failed to see any observational support for this idea. On the contrary, we show that the observations both in two-phase HI and one phase CO show similar results. Moreover, the observed change is in good agreement with LP00 predictions and spectral indexes of velocity and density spectra that are obtained following LP00 procedures are in good agreement with the numerically confirmed expectations of compressible MHD turbulence theory. In short, we could not find any justification of the criticism of LP00 theory that is provided in CX19. On the contrary, our analysis testifies that both available observational and numerical data agree well with the predictions of LP00 theory."

This is the first time that such a large and homogeneous high-resolution (R>80 000) spectroscopic survey has been used to derive these fundamental stellar parameters. We derived the radii using Stefan-Boltzmann's law. We obtained the required effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ from a spectral analysis and we obtained the required luminosities L from integrated broadband photometry together with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries known in the literature. We compared this method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log g, which was obtained from the same spectral analysis as $T_{\rm eff}$. (2) We used a widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets with evolutionary models. Between spectral types M0V and M7V our radii cover the range $0.1\,R_{\normalsize\odot}<R<0.6\,R_{\normalsize\odot}$ with an error of 2-3% and our masses cover $0.09\,{\mathcal M}_{\normalsize\odot}<{\mathcal M}<0.6\,{\mathcal M}_{\normalsize\odot}$ with an error of 3-5%. We find good agreement between the masses determined with these different methods for most of our targets. Only the masses of very young objects show discrepancies.

The field of machine learning has traditionally been categorized pedagogically into $supervised~vs~unsupervised~learning$; where supervised learning has typically referred to learning from labeled data, while unsupervised learning has typically referred to learning from unlabeled data. In this paper, we assert that all machine learning is in fact supervised to some degree, and that the scope of supervision is necessarily commensurate to the scope of learning potential. In particular, we argue that clustering algorithms such as k-means, and dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis, variational autoencoders, and deep belief networks are each internally supervised by the data itself to learn their respective representations of its features. Furthermore, these algorithms are not capable of external inference until their respective outputs (clusters, principal components, or representation codes) have been identified and externally labeled in effect. As such, they do not suffice as examples of unsupervised learning. We propose that the categorization `supervised vs unsupervised learning' be dispensed with, and instead, learning algorithms be categorized as either $internally~or~externally~supervised$ (or both). We believe this change in perspective will yield new fundamental insights into the structure and character of data and of learning algorithms."

The min/max age QA model is trained on the massive structured clinical study records from ClinicalTrials.gov. For each article, based on multiple min and max age values extracted from the QA model, we predict both actual min/max age values for the study samples and filter out non-factual age expressions. Our system improves the results over (i) a passage retrieval based IE system and (ii) a CRF-based system by a large margin when evaluated on an annotated dataset consisting of 50 research papers on smoking cessation."

However, for most Reinforcement Learning tasks, humans can provide additional insight to constrain the policy learning. We introduce a general method to incorporate multiple different feedback channels into a single policy gradient loss. In our formulation, the Multi-Preference Actor Critic (M-PAC), these different types of feedback are implemented as constraints on the policy. We use a Lagrangian relaxation to satisfy these constraints using gradient descent while learning a policy that maximizes rewards. Experiments in Atari and Pendulum verify that constraints are being respected and can accelerate the learning process."

Various dynamic random graph models have been proposed to explain the macroscopic properties of these systems and to provide a foundation for statistical inferences and predictions. It is of interest to have a rigorous way to determine how well these models match observed networks. We thus ask the following goodness of fit question: given a sequence of observations/snapshots of a growing random graph, along with a candidate model M, can we determine whether the snapshots came from M or from some arbitrary alternative model that is well-separated from M in some natural metric? We formulate this problem precisely and boil it down to goodness of fit testing for graph-valued, infinite-state Markov processes and exhibit and analyze a universal test based on non-stationary sampling for a natural class of models."

The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed network are validated both qualitatively and quantitatively on Market-1501 and DeepFashion.

These integrators preserve the Poincar\'e invariants of Hamiltonian dynamics. The $N$-body Hamiltonian has another, perhaps overlooked, symmetry: it is smooth, or, in other words, it has infinite differentiability class order (DCO) for particle separations greater than $0$. Popular symplectic integrators, such as hybrid methods or block adaptive stepping methods do not come from smooth Hamiltonians and it is perhaps unclear whether they should. We investigate the importance of this symmetry by considering hybrid integrators, whose DCO can be tuned easily. Hybrid methods are smooth, except at a finite number of phase space points. We study chaotic planetary orbits in a test considered by Wisdom. We find that increasing smoothness, at negligible extra computational cost in particular tests, improves the Jacobi constant error of the orbits by about $5$ orders of magnitude in long-term simulations. The results from this work suggest that smoothness of the $N$-body Hamiltonian is a property worth preserving in simulations."

In change point analysis, the widely used cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics are sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a robust, tuning-free (i.e., fully data-dependent), and easy-to-implement change point test that enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. To achieve the robust purpose in a nonparametric setting, we formulate the change point detection in the multivariate $U$-statistics framework with anti-symmetric and nonlinear kernels. Specifically, the within-sample noise is cancelled out by anti-symmetry of the kernel, while the signal distortion under certain nonlinear kernels can be controlled such that the between-sample change point signal is magnitude preserving. A (half) jackknife multiplier bootstrap (JMB) tailored to the change point detection setting is proposed to calibrate the distribution of our $\ell^{\infty}$-norm aggregated test statistic. Subject to mild moment conditions on kernels, we derive the uniform rates of convergence for the JMB to approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and analyze its size and power properties."

Most of these methods assume that the blur kernel during downsampling is predefined/known (e.g., bicubic). However, the blur kernels involved in real applications are complicated and unknown, resulting in severe performance drop for the advanced SR methods. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Kernel Correction (IKC) method for blur kernel estimation in blind SR problem, where the blur kernels are unknown. We draw the observation that kernel mismatch could bring regular artifacts (either over-sharpening or over-smoothing), which can be applied to correct inaccurate blur kernels. Thus we introduce an iterative correction scheme -- IKC that achieves better results than direct kernel estimation. We further propose an effective SR network architecture using spatial feature transform (SFT) layers to handle multiple blur kernels, named SFTMD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images show that the proposed IKC method with SFTMD can provide visually favorable SR results and the state-of-the-art performance in blind SR problem."

The invariance of the n-dimensional PDM Euler-Lagrange equations is examined using two possible/different PDM Lagrangian settings. Under the nonlocal point transformation of Mustafa <cite>38</cite>, we have shown that the PDM Euler-Lagrange invariance is only feasible for one particular PDM-Lagrangians settings. Namely, when each velocity component is deformed by some dimensionless scalar multiplier that renders the mass position-dependent. Two illustrative examples are used as reference Lagrangians for different PDM settings, the nonlinear n-dimensional PDM-oscillators and the nonlinear isotonic n-dimensional PDM-oscillators.

The aim of this approach is to improve the speed of dependency parsers by avoiding redundant calculations. This can be resolved by applying the predefined templates that capture results of previous syntactic analyses and directly assigning the stored structure to a new n-gram that matches one of the templates, instead of parsing a similar text fragment again. The study shows that using a heuristic approach to select and reuse the partial results increases parsing speed by reducing the input length to be processed by a parser. The increase in parsing speed comes at some expense of accuracy. Experiments on English show promising results: the input dimension can be reduced by more than 20% at the cost of less than 3 points of Unlabeled Attachment Score."

However, little attention is drawn to other, perhaps more aggressive signal distortions like clipping, chunk elimination, or frequency-band removal. Such distortions can have a large impact not only on intelligibility, but also on naturalness or even speaker identity, and require of careful signal reconstruction. In this work, we give full consideration to this generalized speech enhancement task, and show it can be tackled with a time-domain generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, we extend a previous GAN-based speech enhancement system to deal with mixtures of four types of aggressive distortions. Firstly, we propose the addition of an adversarial acoustic regression loss that promotes a richer feature extraction at the discriminator. Secondly, we also make use of a two-step adversarial training schedule, acting as a warm up-and-fine-tune sequence. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that these two additions bring improved speech reconstructions that better match the original speaker identity and naturalness."

In order to tackle these challenges with real-time replanning, we introduce a metric for target visibility and propose a cascaded chasing planner. By means of the graph-search methods, we first generate a sequence of chasing corridors and waypoints which ensure safety and optimize visibility. In the following phase, the corridors and waypoints are utilized as constraints and objective in quadratic programming from which we complete a dynamically feasible trajectory for chasing.

The library has been primarily designed for the Monte Carlo transport of particles scattering over medium to long ranges, e.g. atmospheric muons. But, it can also efficiently handle ray tracing problems with very large DEMs ($10^9$ nodes or more), e.g. for neutrino simulations. The TURTLE library was built on an optimistic ray tracing algorithm, detailed in the present paper. This algorithm proceeds by trials and errors, approximating the topography within the modelling uncertainties of the DEM data. This allows to traverse a topography in constant time, i.e. independently of the number of grid nodes, and with no added memory. Detailed performance studies are provided by comparison to other ray tracing algorithms and as an application to muon transport in a Monte Carlo simulation."

Recently, G2P conversion is viewed as a sequence to sequence task and modeled by RNN or CNN based encoder-decoder framework. However, previous works do not consider the practical issues when deploying G2P model in the production system, such as how to leverage additional unlabeled data to boost the accuracy, as well as reduce model size for online deployment. In this work, we propose token-level ensemble distillation for G2P conversion, which can (1) boost the accuracy by distilling the knowledge from additional unlabeled data, and (2) reduce the model size but maintain the high accuracy, both of which are very practical and helpful in the online production system. We use token-level knowledge distillation, which results in better accuracy than the sequence-level counterpart. What is more, we adopt the Transformer instead of RNN or CNN based models to further boost the accuracy of G2P conversion. Experiments on the publicly available CMUDict dataset and an internal English dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Particularly, our method achieves 19.88% WER on CMUDict dataset, outperforming the previous works by more than 4.22% WER, and setting the new state-of-the-art results."

A new dynamical phase associated with such a construction is identified. By choosing distributions not belonging to this class, we produce explicit examples of both free particles and harmonic systems evolving in a bounded phase-space in such a way that entropy is nonconserved. While these nonconserving states are classically forbidden, they may be interpreted as states of a quantum system tunneling through a potential barrier boundary. In this case, the allowed boundary conditions are the only distinction between classical and quantum systems. We show that the boundary conditions for a tunneling quantum system become the criteria for entropy preservation in the classical limit. These findings highlight how boundary effects drastically change the nature of a system."

In this paper, we propose generic cross-task baseline systems based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The motivation is to investigate the performance of a variety of models across several audio recognition tasks without exploiting the specific characteristics of the tasks. We looked at CNNs with 5, 9, and 13 layers, and found that the optimal architecture is task-dependent.

This corresponds to the vertex colouring problem in graph theory, for which there are well-known semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. In practice, however, the mutual-exclusion constraint is typically combined with many other constraints, whose SDP representability has not been studied.   We present SDP relaxations for a variety of mutual-exclusion scheduling and timetabling problems, starting from a bound on the number of tasks executed within each period, which corresponds to graph colouring bounded in the number of uses of each colour. In theory, this provides the strongest known bounds for these problems that are computable to any precision in time polynomial in the dimensions. In practice, we report encouraging computational results on random graphs, Knesser graphs, ``forbidden intersection'' graphs, the Toronto benchmark, and the International Timetabling Competition."

A practically useful malware classifier must be robust against evasion attacks. However, achieving such robustness is an extremely challenging task.   In this paper, we take the first steps towards training robust PDF malware classifiers with verifiable robustness properties. For instance, a robustness property can enforce that no matter how many pages from benign documents are inserted into a PDF malware, the classifier must still classify it as malicious. We demonstrate how the worst-case behavior of a malware classifier with respect to specific robustness properties can be formally verified. Furthermore, we find that training classifiers that satisfy formally verified robustness properties can increase the evasion cost of unbounded (i.e., not bounded by the robustness properties) attackers by eliminating simple evasion attacks.   Specifically, we propose a new distance metric that operates on the PDF tree structure and specify two classes of robustness properties including subtree insertions and deletions. We utilize state-of-the-art verifiably robust training method to build robust PDF malware classifiers. Our results show that, we can achieve 92.27% average verified robust accuracy over three properties, while maintaining 99.74% accuracy and 0.56% false positive rate. With simple robustness properties, our robust model maintains 7% higher robust accuracy than all the baseline models against unrestricted whitebox attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art and new adaptive evolutionary attackers need up to 10 times larger $L_0$ feature distance and 21 times more PDF basic mutations (e.g., inserting and deleting objects) to evade our robust model than the baselines."

The proposed cases package together related information so the analyst can see a bigger picture of what is happening, and their evidence includes internal network activity resembling reconnaissance and data collection.   The core ideas are to 1) detect fundamental campaign behaviors by following data movements over extended time periods, 2) link together behaviors associated with different meta-goals, and 3) use machine learning to understand what activities are expected and consistent for each individual network. We call this approach campaign analytics because it focuses on the threat actor's campaign goals and the intrinsic steps to achieve them. Linking different campaign behaviors (internal reconnaissance, collection, exfiltration) reduces false positives from business-as-usual activities and creates opportunities to detect threats before a large exfiltration occurs. Machine learning makes it practical to deploy this approach by reducing the amount of tuning needed."

In this work, we have fabricated epitaxial bilayers composed of polar 3d LaMnO3 and nonpolar 5d SrIrO3. Systematic magnetic measurements reveal an unexpectedly large exchange bias effect in the bilayer, together with a dramatic enhancement of the coercivity of LaMnO3. Based on first-principles calculations and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, such a strong interfacial magnetic coupling is found closely associated with the polar nature of LaMnO3 and the strong spin-orbit interaction in SrIrO3, which collectively drives an asymmetric interfacial charge transfer and leads to the emergence of an interfacial spin glass state. Our study provides new insight into the charge transfer in transition-metal oxide heterostructures and offers a novel means to tune the interfacial exchange coupling for a variety of device applications."

We show how subgap currents exhibiting Multiple Andreev Reflections -- the stimulated transport of electrons in the presence of Cooper-pairs -- can be controlled via engineering of superconducting leads or superfluid atomic gases. Our approach incorporates dissipation within the channel, which is naturally occurring and can be engineered in cold gas experiments. This opens opportunities for engineering many phenomena with transport in strongly interacting systems.

To efficiently solve the objective, we exploit two properties of linear classifiers: implicit differentiation of the optimality conditions of the convex problem and the dual formulation of the optimization problem. This allows us to use high-dimensional embeddings with improved generalization at a modest increase in computational overhead. Our approach, named MetaOptNet, achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100 few-shot learning benchmarks.

We focus on the BH mass function and chirp-mass redshift distribution of mergers visible to gravitational wave observatories. We incorporate the GEODE blueshift into an initially Salpeter stellar remnant distribution, and model the binary population by evolving synthesized binary remnant distributions, published before LIGO's first measurements. We find that a GEODE produced between $20 < z < 40$, and observed at $z \sim 7$, will have its initial mass amplified by $18-134\times$. This can relieve tension between accretion-only growth models and the inferred masses of BHs in quasars at $z \gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that merger rates of GEODE binaries increase by a factor of $\sim 2\times$ relative to classical BHs. The resulting GEODE mass function is consistent with the most recent LIGO constraints at $< 0.5\sigma$. In contrast, a Salpeter stellar distribution that evolves into classical remnants is in tension at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. This agreement occurs without low-metallicity regions, abnormally large progenitor stars, novel binary formation channels, or primordial object formation at extreme rates. In particular, we find that solar metallicity progenitors, which produce $1.1-1.8\mathrm{M}_\odot$ remnants, overlap with many LIGO observations when evolved as GEODEs."

Partial monitoring by an observer implies that there may exist records unobserved by that observer. It was shown that, given only the observed record, the observer can better estimate the underlying true quantum states, by inferring the unobserved record and using quantum state smoothing, rather than the usual quantum filtering approach. However, the improvement in estimation fidelity, originally examined for a resonantly driven qubit coupled to two vacuum baths, was also shown to vary depending on the types of detection used for the qubit's fluorescence. In this work, we analyse this variation in a systematic way for the first time. We first define smoothing power using an average purity recovery and a relative average purity recovery, of smoothing over filtering. Then, we explore the power for various combinations of fluorescence detection for both observed and unobserved channels. We next propose a method to explain the variation of the smoothing power, based on multi-time correlation strength between fluorescence detection records. The method gives a prediction of smoothing power for different combinations, which is remarkably successful in comparison with numerically simulated qubit trajectories."

However, they sacrifice support for concurrent state access that eases the burden of developing stateful stream applications. Recently, some have proposed managing concurrent state access during stream processing by modeling state accesses as transactions. However, these are realized with locks involving serious contention overhead. Their coarse-grained processing paradigm further magnifies contention issues and tends to poorly utilize modern multicore architectures. This paper introduces TStream , a novel DSPS supporting efficient concurrent state access on multicore processors. Transactional semantics is employed like previous work, but scalability is greatly improved due to two novel designs: 1) dual-mode scheduling, which exposes more parallelism opportunities, 2) dynamic restructuring execution, which aggressively exploits the parallelism opportunities from dual-mode scheduling without centralized lock contentions. To validate our proposal, we evaluate TStream with a benchmark of four applications on a modern multicore machine. The experimental results show that 1) TStream achieves up to 4.8 times higher throughput with similar processing latency compared to the state-of-the-art and 2) unlike prior solutions, TStream is highly tolerant of varying application workloads such as key skewness and multi-partition state accesses."

To understand the fundamental limit of the detection performance, the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is proposed with the assumption of perfect and global channel state information (CSI) at the BS. This multi-user detector, however, is not practical due to the unrealistic CSI assumption and the overwhelming detection complexity. These limitations are addressed by presenting a novel detection framework inspired by supervised-learning. The key idea is to model the complicated multihop MU-MIMO channel as a simplified channel with much fewer and learnable parameters. One major finding is that, even using the simplified channel model, a near ML detection performance is achievable with a reasonable amount of pilot overheads in a certain condition. In addition, an online supervised-learning detector is proposed, which adaptively tracks channel variations. The idea is to update the model parameters with a reliably detected data symbol by treating it as a new training (labelled) data. Lastly, a multi-user detector using a deep neural network is proposed. Unlike the model-based approaches, this model-free approach enables to remove the errors in the simplified channel model, while increasing the computational complexity for parameter learning. Via simulations, the detection performances of classical, model-based, and model-free detectors are thoroughly compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the supervised-learning approaches in this channel."

These reactive anti-jamming approaches are constrained by the lack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together the latest advances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering communications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively ""face"" the jammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or transmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically, to deal with unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., Q-learning. However, the Q-learning algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence to the optimal policy, especially when the system state and action spaces are large. This makes the Q-learning algorithm pragmatically inapplicable. To overcome this problem, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm using the recent dueling neural network architecture. Our proposed algorithm allows the transmitter to effectively learn about the jammer and attain the optimal countermeasures thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Through extensive simulation results, we show that our design (using ambient backscattering and the deep dueling neural network architecture) can improve the average throughput by up to 426% and reduce the packet loss by 24%. By augmenting the ambient backscattering capability on devices and using our algorithm, it is interesting to observe that the (successful) transmission rate increases with the jamming power. Our proposed solution can find its applications in both civil (e.g., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications or URLLC) and military scenarios (to combat both inadvertent and deliberate jamming)."

The presence of inflows of metal-poor gas that trigger star formation bursts of low metallicity has been proposed as an explanation for the local anti-correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas-phase metallicity ($\rm Z_g$) found in the literature. In the present study, we show how the anti-correlation is also present as part of a diversified range of behaviours for a sample of more than 700 nearby spiral galaxies from the SDSS IV MaNGA survey. We have characterized the local relation between SFR and $\rm Z_g$ after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities. $60\%$ of the analyzed galaxies display a $\rm SFR-Z_g$ anti-correlation, with the remaining $40\%$ showing no correlation ($19\%$) or positive correlation ($21\%$). Applying a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we obtain that the slope of the correlation is mainly determined by the average gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy. Galaxy mass, $g-r$ colors, stellar age, and mass density seem to play a less significant role. This result is supported by the performed 2nd-order polynomial regression analysis. Thus, the local $\rm SFR-Z_g$ slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest $\rm SFR-Z_g$ anti-correlations), and reversing the relation for more metal-rich systems. Our results suggest that external gas accretion fuels star-formation in metal-poor galaxies, whereas in metal-rich systems the gas comes from previous star formation episodes."

High-quality synthesis can be achieved with neural vocoders, such as WaveNet, but such autoregressive models suffer from slow sequential inference. Meanwhile, their existing parallel inference counterparts are difficult to train and require increasingly large model sizes. In this paper, we propose an alternative training strategy for a parallel neural vocoder utilizing generative adversarial networks, and integrate a linear predictive synthesis filter into the model. Results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvement in inference speed, while outperforming a WaveNet in copy-synthesis quality."

It has been extensively studied from an ethnomethodological point of view and empirically reproduced by multi agent simulations. Whilst such simulations have been used to design real work settings the underlying theoretical grounding for the process is vague. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the emergence of mutual knowledge (MK) in a group of co-located individuals can be explained as a percolation phenomenon. The followed methodology consists in coupling agent-based simulation with dynamic networks analysis to study information propagation phenomena: after using an agent-based simulation we generated and then analysed its traces as networks where agents met and exchanged knowledge. Deep analysis of the resulting networks clearly shows that the emergence of MK is comparable to a percolation process. We specifically focus on how changes at the microscopic level in our agent based simulator affect percolation and robustness. These results therefore provides theoretical basis for the analysis of social organizations.

Furthermore, the lower sum sideband generation can be enhanced with several orders of magnitude by tuning the nonlinear gain parameter and the phase of the field pumping the OPA. The enhanced sum sideband may have potential applications to the manipulation of light in a on-chip optomechanical device and the sensitively sensing for precision measurement in the weak optomechanical coupling regime."

Although it is easy to use, such top-hat masking is known to suffer from various leakage problems. Therefore, we want to extend the top-hat masking to a series of semi-analytic functions called the P-filters. Most importantly, the P-filters can seamlessly realize the core idea of masking in CMB science, and, meanwhile, guarantee continuity up to the first derivative everywhere. The P-filters can significantly reduce many leakage problems without additional cost, including the leakages due to low-, high-, and band-pass filtering, and the E-to-E, B-to-B, B-to-E, and E-to-B leakages. The workings of the P-filter are illustrated by using the WMAP and Planck polarization sky maps. By comparison to the corresponding WMAP/Planck masks, we show that the P-filter performs much better than top-hat masking, and meanwhile, has the potential to supersede the principal idea of masking in CMB science. Compared to mask apodization, the P-filter is ``outward'', that tends to make proper use of the region that was marked as 0; whereas apodization is ``inward'', that always kills more signal in the region marked as 1."

For a connected graph $G$, the Mostar index is defined as $Mo(G) = \sum_{e=uv \in E(G)} |n_u(e) - n_v(e)|$, where for an edge $e=uv$ we denote by $n_u(e)$ the number of vertices of $G$ that are closer to $u$ than to $v$ and by $n_v(e)$ the number of vertices of $G$ that are closer to $v$ than to $u$. In this paper, we generalize the definition of the Mostar index to weighted graphs and prove that the Mostar index of a weighted graph can be computed in terms of Mostar indices of weighted quotient graphs. As a consequence, we show that the Mostar index of a benzenoid system can be computed in sub-linear time with respect to the number of vertices.

Using Fisher information methods, we combine observational constraints from simulated BNS merger events drawn from various population models with independent measurements of the neutron star radii expected from x-ray astronomy (the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations in particular) to directly constrain nuclear physics parameters. To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. This method eschews the need to invoke the so-called parabolic approximation to extrapolate from symmetric nuclear matter, allowing us to directly constrain the neutron-matter EoS. Using a principal component analysis, we identify the combination of parameters most tightly constrained by observational data. We discuss sensitivity to various effects such as different component masses through population-model sensitivity, phase transitions in the core EoS, and large deviations from the central parameter values."

This suggests observational searches for new phenomena in this regime, and in particular for those necessary to make black hole evolution consistent with quantum mechanics. We describe possible features of ""compact quantum objects"" that replace classical black holes in a consistent quantum theory, and approaches to observational tests for these using gravitational waves. This is an example of a more general problem of finding consistent descriptions of deviations from general relativity, which can be tested via gravitational wave detection. Simple models for compact modifications to classical black holes are described via an effective stress tensor, possibly with an effective equation of state. A general discussion is given of possible observational signatures, and of their dependence on properties of the colliding objects. The possibility that departures from classical behavior are restricted to the near-horizon regime raises the question of whether these will be obscured in gravitational wave signals, due to their mutual interaction in a binary coalescence being deep in the mutual gravitational well. Numerical simulation with such simple models will be useful to clarify the sensitivity of gravitational wave observation to such highly compact departures from classical black holes."

In addition, we show inclusion of jet production cross section data and considering $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ as a pQCD free parameter not only reduce dramatically the uncertainty band of gluon distribution but also improve the consistency between experiment and theory of NC and CC deep inelastic ${e^\pm}p$ scattering cross sections up to $\sim 3.6$~\%. Our simultaneous determination of PDFs and the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ with inclusion of jet production cross sections data leads to $\alpha_s^{{\rm NLO}}(M^2_Z) = 0.12041 \pm 0.00086$, which is in a good agreement with world average and other individual measurements."

In this paper, we present an approach for extracting information from historical war memoirs and turning it into structured knowledge. This is based on the semantic notions of events, participants and roles. We assess quantitatively each of the key-steps of our approach and provide a graph-based representation of the extracted knowledge, which allows the end user to move between close and distant reading of the collection."

As a step towards full decoding of imagined speech from active thoughts, we present a BCI system for subject-independent classification of phonological categories exploiting a novel deep learning based hierarchical feature extraction scheme. To better capture the complex representation of high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compute the joint variability of EEG electrodes into a channel cross-covariance matrix. We then extract the spatio-temporal information encoded within the matrix using a mixed deep neural network strategy. Our model framework is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long-short term network (LSTM), and a deep autoencoder. We train the individual networks hierarchically, feeding their combined outputs in a final gradient boosting classification step. Our best models achieve an average accuracy of 77.9% across five different binary classification tasks, providing a significant 22.5% improvement over previous methods. As we also show visually, our work demonstrates that the speech imagery EEG possesses significant discriminative information about the intended articulatory movements responsible for natural speech synthesis."

Towards Imagined Speech Recognition With Hierarchical   Deep Learning,"Speech-related Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies provide effective vocal communication strategies for controlling devices through speech commands interpreted from brain signals. In order to infer imagined speech from active thoughts, we propose a novel hierarchical deep learning BCI system for subject-independent classification of 11 speech tokens including phonemes and words. Our novel approach exploits predicted articulatory information of six phonological categories (e.g., nasal, bilabial) as an intermediate step for classifying the phonemes and words, thereby finding discriminative signal responsible for natural speech synthesis. The proposed network is composed of hierarchical combination of spatial and temporal CNN cascaded with a deep autoencoder. Our best models on the KARA database achieve an average accuracy of 83.42% across the six different binary phonological classification tasks, and 53.36% for the individual token identification task, significantly outperforming our baselines. Ultimately, our work suggests the possible existence of a brain imagery footprint for the underlying articulatory movement related to different sounds that can be used to aid imagined speech decoding."

While neural networks have shown to be effective at various interpretation tasks, a fundamental challenge is the lack of labeled data points in the subsurface. For example, the interpolation and extrapolation of well-based lithology using seismic images relies on a small number of known labels. Besides well-known data augmentation techniques, as well as regularization of the network output, we propose and test another approach to deal with the lack of labels. Non learning-based horizon trackers work very well in the shallow subsurface where seismic images are of higher quality and the geological units are roughly layered. We test if these segmented and shallow units can help train neural networks to predict deeper geological units that are not layered and flat. We show that knowledge of shallow geological units helps to predict deeper units when there are only a few labels for training using a dataset from the Sea of Ireland. We employ U-net based multi-resolution networks, and we show that these networks can be described using matrix-vector product notation in a similar fashion as standard geophysical inverse problems."

With no fault tolerance theorems to guarantee the resilience of such algorithms against errors, understanding the impact of imperfections on their performance is of both scientific and practical significance. We study the robustness of the algorithm against various types of imperfections: limited control over the interpolating schedule, Hamiltonian misspecification, and interactions with a thermal environment. We find that the unstructured search algorithm's quadratic speedup is generally not robust to the presence of any one of the above non-idealities, and in some cases we find that it imposes unrealistic conditions on how the strength of these noise sources must scale to maintain the quadratic speedup."

Under the assumption of pairwise separability and scaled diagonal dominance, asymptotic convergence is established and a simple bound for the convergence rate is provided for message-passing. In comparison with previous results, our results do not require the given convex program to have known convex pairwise components and that our bound for the convergence rate is tighter and simpler. When specialised to quadratic optimisation, we generalise known results by providing a very simple bound for the convergence rate."

While the natural outcome of a Bayesian analysis is a posterior distribution, Bayesian meta-analyses traditionally combine analyses summarized as point estimates, often limiting distributional assumptions. In this paper, we develop a framework for combining posterior distributions, which builds on standard Bayesian inference, but using distributions instead of data points as observations. We show that the resulting framework preserves basic theoretical properties, such as order-invariance in successive updates and posterior concentration. In addition to providing a consensus analysis for multiple Bayesian analyses, we highlight the benefit of being able to reuse posteriors from computationally costly analyses and update them post-hoc without having to rerun the analyses themselves. The wide applicability of the framework is illustrated with examples of combining results from likelihood-free Bayesian analyses, which would be difficult to carry out using standard methodology."

The effects of modulation depth and modulation signal phase on the cooling result were investigated in detail. With such a digital parametric feedback method, the centre-of-mass temperature of all three motional degrees of freedom can be cooled to dozens of milli-Kelvin, which paved the way to fully control the motion of the levitated nanoparticle with a programmable digital process for wild applications."

We prove that there is a sharp phase transition at the threshold $\alpha^*_n =\sqrt{2\log n}$: below the threshold ($\alpha_n\ll \sqrt{2\log n}$), $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ has negative components with probability tending to 1 while above ($\alpha_n\gg \sqrt{2\log n}$), all the vector's components are eventually positive with probability tending to 1. At the critical scaling $\alpha^*_n$, we provide a heuristics to evaluate the probability that $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ is positive.Such linear systems arise as solutions at equilibrium of large Lotka-Volterra systems of differential equations, widely used to describe large biological communities with interactions such as foodwebs for instance. In the domaine of positivity of the solution $\boldsymbol{x}_n$, that is when $\alpha_n\gg \sqrt{2\log n}$, we establish that the Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations whose solution at equilibrium is precisely $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ is stable in the sense that its jacobian $${\mathcal J}(\boldsymbol{x}_n) = \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{x}_n)\left(-I_n + \frac {A_n}{\alpha_n\sqrt{n}}\right)$$ has all its eigenvalues with negative real part with probability tending to one.

For robustness, we use both deep neural networks and traditional machine learning models and combine them as ensemble models through logistic regression. They are trained to detect logical access (LA) and physical access (PA) attacks on the dataset released as part of the ASV Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge 2019. We propose dataset partitions that ensure different attack types are present during training and validation to improve system robustness. Our ensemble model outperforms all our single models and the baselines from the challenge for both attack types. We investigate why some models on the PA dataset strongly outperform others and find that spoofed recordings in the dataset tend to have longer silences at the end than genuine ones. By removing them, the PA task becomes much more challenging, with the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) of our best single model rising from 0.1672 to 0.5018 and equal error rate (EER) increasing from 5.98% to 19.8% on the development set."

Complex time reveals a new perspective on holomorphic dynamical systems."

Advances in the 2019 edition include: (i) a consideration of both logical access (LA) and physical access (PA) scenarios and the three major forms of spoofing attack, namely synthetic, converted and replayed speech; (ii) spoofing attacks generated with state-of-the-art neural acoustic and waveform models; (iii) an improved, controlled simulation of replay attacks; (iv) use of the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) that reflects the impact of both spoofing and countermeasures upon ASV reliability. Even if ASV remains the core focus, in retaining the equal error rate (EER) as a secondary metric, ASYspoof also embraces the growing importance of fake audio detection. ASVspoof 2019 attracted the participation of 63 research teams, with more than half of these reporting systems that improve upon the performance of two baseline spoofing countermeasures.

The user control ability allows to explicitly specify the texture which should be generated by the model. This property follows from using an encoder part which learns a latent representation for each texture from the dataset. To ensure a dataset coverage, we use an adversarial loss function that penalizes for incorrect reproductions of a given texture. In experiments, we show that our model can learn descriptive texture manifolds for large datasets and from raw data such as a collection of high-resolution photos. Moreover, we apply our method to produce 3D textures and show that it outperforms existing baselines."

Many beautiful questions and conjectures about covering systems have been posed over the past several decades, but until recently little was known about their properties. Most famously, the so-called minimum modulus problem of Erd\H{o}s was resolved in 2015 by Hough, who proved that in every covering system with distinct moduli, the minimum modulus is at most $10^{16}$.   In this paper we answer another question of Erd\H{o}s, asked in 1952, on the number of minimal covering systems. More precisely, we show that the number of minimal covering systems with exactly $n$ elements is \[ \exp\left( \left(\frac{4\sqrt{\tau}}{3} + o(1)\right) \frac{n^{3/2}}{(\log n)^{1/2}} \right) \] as $n \to \infty$, where \[ \tau = \sum_{t = 1}^\infty \left( \log \frac{t+1}{t} \right)^2. \] En route to this counting result, we obtain a structural description of all covering systems that are close to optimal in an appropriate sense."

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can provide powerful tools for differentiating between patterns of calorimeter energy deposits by prompt particles of Standard Model and long-lived particles predicted in various models beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate the usefulness of CNN by using a couple of physics examples from well motivated BSM scenarios predicting long-lived particles giving rise to displaced jets. Our work suggests that modern machine-learning techniques have potential to discriminate between energy deposition patterns of prompt and long-lived particles, and thus, they can be useful tools in such searches."

We carried out new $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) observations toward the SNR using Mopra and the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment. We found eight molecular clouds (A-H) along the X-ray shell of the SNR. The typical cloud size and mass are $\sim$10-15 pc and $\sim$1000-3000 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The X-ray shell is slightly deformed and has the brightest peak in the southwestern shell where two molecular clouds A and B are located. The four molecular clouds A, B, F, and G have high intensity ratios of $^{12}$CO($J$ = 3-2) / $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) $> 1.2$, which are not attributable to any identified internal infrared sources or high-mass stars. The HI cavity and its expanding motion are found toward the SNR, which are likely created by strong stellar winds from a massive progenitor. We suggest that the molecular clouds A-D, F, and G and HI clouds within the wind-blown cavity at $V_\mathrm{LSR} = 117.1$-122.5 km s$^{-1}$ are to be associated with the SNR. The X-ray spectroscopy reveals the dynamical age of $26000^{+1000}_{-2000}$ yr and the progenitor mass of $\gtrsim 30$ $M_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with the proposed scenario. We determine physical conditions of the giant molecular cloud LIRS 36A using the large velocity gradient analysis with archival datasets of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array; the kinematic temperature is $72^{+50}_{-37}$ K and the number density of molecular hydrogen is $1500^{+600}_{-300}$ cm$^{-3}$.

We investigate potential physical sources for the large c.m. motion in binary black hole simulations and find that a significant fraction of the c.m. motion cannot be explained physically, thus concluding that it is largely a gauge effect. These large c.m. displacements cause mode mixing in the gravitational waveform, most easily recognized as amplitude oscillations caused by the dominant (2,$\pm$2) modes mixing into subdominant modes. This mixing does not diminish with increasing distance from the source; it is present even in asymptotic waveforms, regardless of the method of data extraction. We describe the current c.m.-correction method used by the SXS collaboration, which is based on counteracting the motion of the c.m. as measured by the trajectories of the apparent horizons in the simulations, and investigate potential methods to improve that correction to the waveform. We also present a complementary method for computing an optimal c.m. correction or evaluating any other c.m. transformation based solely on the asymptotic waveform data."

The effectiveness of different forms of control is explored in researches aimed at identifying the balance between pest control efficiency and environmental damage caused by the treatments applied. Plantations with large territorial extensions, which can be contiguous or not, are usually subdivided into local administration that collects data to determine the frequencies of areas size occupied by ant nests. The purpose of this work is to build a relationship of similarities among different geographical regions using the frequency data of nests size occurrence by applying Information Bottleneck (IB) method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). IB allows simultaneous clustering of each region with the ant nest size distribution, while PCA is used to reduce the variable dimensionalities into a three-dimensional representation of the results. The approach was applied to data of leaf-cutting ants Atta spp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in cultivated Eucalyptus spp forests in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results suggest information acquired by the method can help coordinate pest management, such as the allocation of baits, material and personnel."

Using simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation we find striking similarities to viscous flows: from production of starting vortices to convergence of airfoil circulation onto a quantized version of the Kutta-Joukowski circulation. We predict the number of quantized vortices nucleated by a given foil via a phenomenological argument. We further find stall-like behavior governed by airfoil speed, not angle of attack, as in classical flows. Finally we analyze the lift and drag acting on the airfoil."

Our multiscale model is founded upon a new compressible-incompressible decomposition of the velocity field $u=v+w$. The incompressible component $w$ of the velocity is also irrotational and is solved using a new asymptotic model of the Birkhoff-Rott singular integral formulation of the incompressible Euler equations, which reduces the problem to one spatial dimension. This asymptotic model, called the higher-order $z$-model, is derived using small nonlocality as the asymptotic parameter, allows for interface turn-over and roll-up, and yields a significant simplification for the equation describing the evolution of the amplitude of vorticity. This incompressible component $w$ of the velocity controls the small scale structures of the interface and can be solved efficiently on fine grids. Meanwhile, the compressible component of the velocity $v$ remains continuous near contact discontinuities and can be computed on relatively coarse grids, while receiving subgrid scale information from $w$. We first validate the incompressible higher-order $z$-model by comparison with classical RTI experiments as well as full point vortex simulations. We then consider both the RTI and the RMI problems for our multiscale model of compressible flow with vorticity, and show excellent agreement with our high-resolution gas dynamics solutions."

Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that magnetism in such electron-rich two-dimensional (2D) materials originates from the anionic electrons rather than partially filled d orbitals, which is fundamentally different from ferromagnetism found in other 2D intrinsic magnetic materials. Taking the honeycomb LaBr$_2$ (La$^{3+}$Br$^{-}_{2}\cdot e^{-}$) as an example, our calculations reveal that the excess electron is localized at the center of the hexagon, which leads to strong Stoner-instability of the associated states at the Fermi energy, resulting in spontaneous magnetization and formation of a local moment. The overlap of extended tails of the wave functions of these electrons mediates a long-range ferromagnetic interaction, contributing to a Curie temperature ($T_\textrm{c}$) of 235 K and a coercive field ($H_\textrm{c}$) of 0.53 T, which can be further enhanced by hole doping. The dual nature, localization and extension, of the electronic states suggests a unique mechanism in such magnetic-element-free electrenes as intrinsic 2D ferromagnets."

However, despite various existing approaches for omnidirectional image stitching, how to quantitatively assess the quality of stitched images is still insufficiently explored. To address this problem, we establish a novel omnidirectional image dataset containing stitched images as well as dual-fisheye images captured from standard quarters of 0$^\circ$, 90$^\circ$, 180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$. In this manner, when evaluating the quality of an image stitched from a pair of fisheye images (e.g., 0$^\circ$ and 180$^\circ$), the other pair of fisheye images (e.g., 90$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$) can be used as the cross-reference to provide ground-truth observations of the stitching regions. Based on this dataset, we further benchmark six widely used stitching models with seven evaluation metrics for IQA. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dataset that focuses on assessing the stitching quality of omnidirectional images."

In either outdoor autonomous or semi-autonomous flights missions strong GPS signal is vital for UAV to locate its own positions. However, strong GPS signal is not always available, and it can degrade or fully loss underneath large structures or close to power lines, which can cause serious control issues or even UAV crashes. Such limitations highly restricted the applications of UAV as a routine inspection tool in various domains. In this paper a vision-model-based real-time self-positioning method is proposed to support autonomous aerial inspection without the need of GPS support.

Solid-state realizations of two-level atomic transitions or three-level spin-$\Lambda$ systems offer significant advantages over their atomic counterparts for this purpose, albeit decoherence can arise due to environmental couplings. One popular approach to mitigate dephasing is to operate in the weak excitation limit, where excited state population is minimal and coherently scattered photons dominate over incoherent emission. Here we probe the coherence of photons produced using two-level and spin-$\Lambda$ solid-state systems. We observe that the coupling of the atomic-like transitions to the vibronic transitions of the crystal lattice is independent of driving strength and detuning. We apply a polaron master equation to capture the non-Markovian dynamics of the ground state vibrational manifolds. These results provide insight into the fundamental limitations for photon coherence from solid-state quantum emitters, with the consequence that deterministic single-shot quantum protocols are impossible and inherently probabilistic approaches must be embraced."

On such backgrounds, one can classify the components of massive tensor fields into the tensor, vector, and scalar-type components. For the tensor-type components, which arise only in higher dimensions, the massive tensor field equation reduces to a single master equation, whereas the vector and scalar-type components remain coupled. We consider the near-horizon expansion of both the geometry and the field variables with respect to the near-horizon scaling parameter. By doing so, we reduce, at each order of the expansion, the equations of motion for the vector and scalar-type components to a set of five mutually decoupled wave equations with source terms consisting only of the lower-order variables. Thus, together with the tensor-type master equation, we obtain the set of mutually decoupled equations at each order of the expansion that govern all dynamical degrees of freedom of the massive tensor field on the extremal and near-extremal static black hole background."

Among them the zebras, which are prevalently assumed to be generated by the double plasma resonance instability, belong to the most important. In this paper we compute the growth rate of this instability for two types of the electron distribution: a) for the power-law distribution and b) for the kappa distribution, in the both cases with the loss-cone type anisotropy. We found that the growth rate of the upper-hybrid waves for the power-law momentum distribution strongly depends on the pitch-angle boundary. The maximum growth rate was found for the pitch-angle $\theta_\mathrm{c} \approx$ 50$^\circ$. For small angles the growth rate profile is very flat and for high pitch-angles the wave absorption occurs. Furthermore, analyzing the growth rate of the upper hybrid waves for the kappa momentum distribution we found that a decrease of the characteristic momentum $p_\kappa$ shifts the maximum of the growth rate to lower values of the ratio of the electron-plasma and electron-cyclotron frequencies, and the frequency widths of the growth rate peaks are very broad. But, if we consider the kappa distribution which is isotropic up to some large momentum $p_m$ and anisotropic with loss-cone above this momentum then distinct peaks of the growth rate appear and thus distinct zebra stripes can be generated. It means that the restriction for small momenta for the anisotropic part of distributions is of principal importance for the zebra stripes generation. Finally, for the 1 August 2010 zebra stripes, the growth rates in dependence on radio frequency were computed. It was shown that in this case the growth rate peaks are more distinct than in usually presented dependencies of growth rates on the ratio of the plasma and cyclotron frequencies."

The photovoltage generated by selective absorption of the pump beam in a given subcell during photoreflectance measurements results in reverse biasing the complementary subunits at the modulation frequency set on the pump illumination. Such voltage bias modulation acts then as external perturbation on the complementary subcells. The spectral separation of the different subcell absorption ranges permits the probe beam to record in a single spectrum the response of the complete device as a combination of photo- and electroreflectance, thereby providing access for diagnosis of subcells on an individual basis. This form of modulation spectroscopy is demonstrated on a GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cell."

Encoding the correlations between the elementary constituents of the nucleon, GPDs allow a 3-dimensional imaging of the nucleon from the dynamical link between the transverse position and the longitudinal momentum of partons. Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) corresponds to the scattering from the nucleon of a virtual photon that finally generates a lepton pair, where the final leptons can be either an electron or a muon pair. The virtuality of the final photon allows to investigate in a decorrelated way the initial and transferred momentum dependences of the GPDs. This unique feature of DDVCS is of relevance, among others, for the determination of the transverse parton densities and the distribution of nuclear forces. This proceeding discusses preliminary model-predicted DDVCS experimental projections at JLab12 and indicates the impact of potential DDVCS experiments."

Under weak regularity conditions, we show the proposed estimators are consistent and follow normal distributions in large samples. Our conditions impose weaker smoothness and moment conditions on the data-generating process and its likelihood compared to existing theories. Furthermore, the bias terms of the estimators take a simpler form. We demonstrate the usefulness of our general results by applying our theory to local (quasi-)maximum-likelihood estimators of a time-varying VAR's, ARCH and GARCH, and Poisson autogressions. For the first three models, we are able to substantially weaken the conditions found in the existing literature. For the Poisson autogression, existing theories cannot be be applied while our novel approach allows us to analyze it."

More specifically, we first introduce the contact model control approaches, including contact state recognition and compliant control two steps. Additionally, we focus on a comprehensive analysis of the whole robotic assembly system. Second, without the contact state recognition process, we decompose the contact model-free learning algorithms into two main subfields: learning from demonstrations and learning from environments (mainly based on reinforcement learning). For each subfield, we survey the landmark studies and ongoing research to compare the different categories. We hope to strengthen the relation between these two research communities by revealing the underlying links. Ultimately, the remaining challenges and open questions in the field of robotic peg-in-hole assembly community is discussed. The promising directions and potential future work are also considered."

The problem of joint non-convex three-dimensional (3D) deployment and dynamic movement of the UAVs is formulated for maximizing the sum mean opinion score (MOS) of ground users, which is proved to be NP-hard. In the aim of solving this pertinent problem, a three-step approach is proposed for attaining 3D deployment and dynamic movement of multiple UAVs. Firstly, genetic algorithm based K-means (GAK-means) algorithm is utilized for obtaining the cell partition of the users. Secondly, Q-learning based deployment algorithm is proposed, in which each UAV acts as an agent, making their own decision for attaining 3D position by learning from trial and mistake. In contrast to conventional genetic algorithm based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is capable of training the direction selection strategy offline. Thirdly, Q-learning based movement algorithm is proposed in the scenario that the users are roaming. The proposed algorithm is capable of converging to an optimal state. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithms show a fast convergence rate after a small number of iterations. Additionally, the proposed Q-learning based deployment algorithm outperforms K-means algorithms and Iterative-GAKmean (IGK) algorithms with a low complexity."

Unlike atomic systems, solid-state emitters couple to their host lattice by phonons. Using a quantum dot in an optical nanocavity, we resolve these interactions in both time and frequency domains, going beyond the atomic picture to develop a comprehensive model of light scattering from solid-state emitters. We find that even in the presence of a cavity, phonon coupling leads to a sideband that is completely insensitive to excitation conditions, and to a non-monotonic relationship between laser detuning and coherent fraction, both major deviations from atom-like behaviour."

The ties and their patterns are based on their life styles and communication. Similarly, in online social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, Myspace etc., multiple users belong to multiple specific communities. The social network represents large real-world directed social graphs. Detection of communities or clusters from these graphs is a problem of considerable research interest. The communities are formed using the neighboring nodes that have common edges and common attributes. Most of the existing community detection algorithms usually consider node contents to analyze the attributes of community. Some algorithms use the links between the nodes to determine the dense regions in the graph. But utilizing both the edge content and the vertex content to detect community are yet to be considered and verified, since the traditional extraction methods of vertex and edge data do not consider the connectivity among the nodes. This paper presents an Interlinked Spatial Clustering Model (ILSCM) which provides relevant content selection and extraction of the temporal topics for identifying the betweenness among the nodes based on the context keys to detect community."

Puzzlingly, in quantum theory both concepts seem to be intimately related. It is known that, due to Neumark's dilation theorem, every instance of quantum Bell nonlocality is equivalent to an instance of quantum KS contextuality. However, so far, no reverse one-to-one connection was identified. Here we show that every quantum violation of a KS noncontextuality inequality can be converted into a violation by the same degree of a generalized Bell inequality (i.e., derived under the assumption of local realism and perfect correlations). This reverse connection opens many possibilities. For example, it shows how to test every instance of quantum KS contextuality by-passing the compatibility loophole and the requirement of perfectly ideal measurements."

Here we find the grey-body factors and energy emission rates for Hawking radiation of test Dirac and electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of such a non-Schwarzschild black hole. The temperature and mass of the black hole monotonically decrease from its Schwarzschild value to zero when the coupling constant is increased up to its extremal value. Nevertheless, for small and moderate values of the coupling constant the Hawking radiation is enhanced, and only in the regime of large coupling it is suppressed, as one could expect. The reason for such counter-intuitive behavior is the important role of the grey-body factors: for small and moderate couplings the temperature falls relatively slowly, while the effective potentials for black holes of the same mass become considerably lower, allowing for much higher transmission rates. We have also estimated the lifetime of such black holes and shown that the range of black-hole masses at which ultra-relativistic emission of massive electrons and positrons starts is shifted towards smaller black-hole masses when the coupling constant is large."

The process of ""freezing-in"" the specific phonon can bring electronic eigenstates that are energetically close in energy into an anticrossing. This electronic anticrossing effect is, however, unrelated to the wanted electron-phonon coupling, and needs to be removed. We present a procedure how to deal with these problematic anticrossing situations and apply it to the band gap zero-point motion renormalization of sixteen diamondoids and urotropine using different exchange correlation functionals. We find gap renormalizations of diamondoids in the range of 150 - 400 meV and only 62 meV for urotropine due to the lone-pair character of the highest occupied molecular orbital of the latter."

In this work, a practicable approach of gaining explainability of deep artificial neural networks (NN) using an interpretable surrogate model based on decision trees is presented. Simply fitting a decision tree to a trained NN usually leads to unsatisfactory results in terms of accuracy and fidelity. Using L1-orthogonal regularization during training, however, preserves the accuracy of the NN, while it can be closely approximated by small decision trees. Tests with different data sets confirm that L1-orthogonal regularization yields models of lower complexity and at the same time higher fidelity compared to other regularizers."

In many situations, different clusterings of the same data set become relevant. For example, different algorithms for the same clustering task may return dramatically different solutions. We are interested in applications in which one clustering has to be transformed into another; e.g., when a gradual transition from an old solution to a new one is required. In this paper, we devise methods for constructing such a transition based on linear programming and network theory. We use a so-called clustering-difference graph to model the desired transformation and provide methods for decomposing the graph into a sequence of elementary moves that accomplishes the transformation. These moves are equivalent to the edge directions, or circuits, of the underlying partition polytopes. Therefore, in addition to a conceptually new metric for measuring the distance between clusterings, we provide new bounds on the circuit diameter of these partition polytopes."

This is a challenging task due to the subtlety of human actions in video and the co-occurrence of contextual elements. To address this challenge, we utilize conjugate samples of human actions, which are video clips that are contextually similar to human action samples but do not contain the action. We introduce a novel attentional mechanism that can spatially and temporally separate human actions from the co-occurring contextual factors. The separation of the action and context factors is weakly supervised, eliminating the need for laboriously detailed annotation of these two factors in training samples. Our method can be used to build human action classifiers with higher accuracy and better interpretability. Experiments on several human action recognition datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative benefits of our approach."

Repulsive interactions lead to two distinct instabilities, in singlet- and triplet- interaction channels. In the regime of large fields, the topological character of the superconducting state depends strongly on the magnetic field direction. When the field is applied along one of the three $\Gamma$-$K$ lines, a crystalline topological superconducting phase is stabilized, whereas for other field directions the pairing state is topologically trivial. Depending on the Cooper pairs' center-of-mass momentum, this superconducting state displays either Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces or point nodes. Moreover, a chiral topological superconducting phase with Chern number of 6 is realized in the regime of large Rashba and dominant triplet interactions, spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry."

Among the many tools developed in an o-minimal setting are cohomology theories for abstract-definable continuous manifolds such as singular cohomology, sheaf cohomology and \v Cech cohomology, which have been used for instance to prove Pillay's conjecture concerning definably compact groups. In the present paper we elaborate an o-minimal de Rham cohomology theory for abstract-definable $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ manifolds in an o-minimal expansion of the real field which admits smooth cell decomposition and defines the exponential function. We can specify the o-minimal cohomology groups and attain some properties such as the existence of Mayer-Vietoris sequence and the invariance under abstract-definable $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ diffeomorphisms. However, in order to obtain the invariance of our o-minimal cohomology under abstract-definable homotopy we must, working in a tame context that defines sufficiently many primitives, assume the validity of a statement related to Br\""ocker's question."

The fermions, although not directly coupled to the Raman lasers, acquire an effective spin-orbit coupling through the spin-exchange interaction between the two species. Our calculation shows that this is a promising way of obtaining spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas without Raman-induced heating, where the long-sought topological Fermi superfluids and topological bands can be realized. Conversely, we find that the presence of fermions not only provides a new way to create the supersolid stripe phase of the bosons, but more strikingly it can also greatly increase the spatial period of the bosonic density stripes, and hence makes this phase directly observable in the experiment. This system provides a new and practical platform to explore the physics of spin-orbit coupling, which possesses a dynamic nature through the interaction between the two species."

We propose a centralized coded caching scheme based on a new deterministic placement strategy and a parallel delivery strategy. It is shown that the new scheme optimally allocate the communication loads on the server and users, obtaining cooperation gain and parallel gain that greatly reduces the transmission delay. Furthermore, we show that the number of users who parallelly send information should decrease when the users' caching size increases. In other words, letting more users parallelly send information could be harmful. Finally, we derive a constant multiplicative gap between the lower bound and upper bound on the transmission delay, which proves that our scheme is order optimal."

The computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches."

Our theoretical analysis shows that electron-hole pair excitations in this system can be long-lived, up to several hundred nanoseconds, since the decay into surface phonons is found to be a highly non-linear process. We combine first-principles calculations with help of a hybrid functional (HSE06) with modeling by a Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian coupled to phononic degrees of freedom. The calculations show that the Sn/Si(111) $(\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt 3)$ surface is insulating and the two Sn-derived bands inside the substrate band gap can be described as the lower and upper Hubbard band in a Mott-Hubbard model with $U=0.75$eV. Furthermore, phonon spectra are calculated with particular emphasis on the Sn-related surface phonon modes. The calculations demonstrate that the adequate treatment of electronic correlations leads to a stiffening of the wagging mode of neighboring Sn atoms; thus, we predict that the onset of electronic correlations at low temperature should be observable in the phonon spectrum, too. The deformation potential for electron-phonon coupling is calculated for selected vibrational modes and the decay rate of an electron-hole excitation into multiple phonons is estimated, substantiating the very long lifetime of these excitations."

The first approach uses one general model trained on the embeddings from all available languages. The second method trains the model on a single pivot language and a linear transformation method is used to project other languages onto the pivot language. The popular convolutional neural network and LSTM architectures with different set-ups are used as classifiers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt at multi-lingual DA recognition using neural networks. The multi-lingual models are validated experimentally on two languages from the Verbmobil corpus.

An important problem in many-body physics is itinerant magnetism, which originates purely from long-range interactions of free electrons and whose existence in real systems has been subject to debate for decades. Here we use a quantum simulator consisting of a four-site square plaquette of quantum dots to demonstrate Nagaoka ferromagnetism. This form of itinerant magnetism has been rigorously studied theoretically but has remained unattainable in experiment. We load the plaquette with three electrons and demonstrate the predicted emergence of spontaneous ferromagnetic correlations through pairwise measurements of spin. We find the ferromagnetic ground state is remarkably robust to engineered disorder in the on-site potentials and can induce a transition to the low-spin state by changing the plaquette topology to an open chain. This demonstration of Nagaoka ferromagnetism highlights that quantum simulators can be used to study physical phenomena that have not yet been observed in any system before. The work also constitutes an important step towards large-scale quantum dot simulators of correlated electron systems."

In dimension 2 and for Euclidean spaces of any dimensions, we prove that the total variation of a vector measure is monotone with respect to the range."

We detail convergence and central limit theorems for the resulting MCMC-IS estimators. We also consider the case where the approximate Markov chain is pseudo-marginal, requiring unbiased estimators for its approximate marginal target. Convergence results with asymptotic variance formulae are shown for this case, and for the case where the IS weights based on unbiased estimators are only calculated for distinct output samples of the so-called `jump' chain, which, with a suitable reweighting, allows for improved efficiency. As the IS type weights may assume negative values, extended classes of unbiased estimators may be used for the IS type correction, such as those obtained from randomised multilevel Monte Carlo. Using Euler approximations and coupling of particle filters, we apply the resulting estimator using randomised weights to the problem of parameter inference for partially observed It\^{o} diffusions. Convergence of the estimator is verified to hold under regularity assumptions which do not require that the diffusion can be simulated exactly. In the context of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we suggest an adaptive MCMC approach to deal with the selection of a suitably large tolerance, with IS correction possible to finer tolerance, and with provided approximate confidence intervals. A prominent question is the efficiency of MCMC-IS compared to standard direct MCMC, such as pseudo-marginal, delayed acceptance, and ABC-MCMC. We provide a comparison criterion which generalises the covariance ordering to the IS setting."

The internal pressure is calculated taking into account the occurrence of a phase transition in the $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ total cross section. The model predicts the inversion of the positive and negative pressure regions depending on the squared energy $s_0$, where the total cross section achieves its minimum value. Considering energies below the phase transition the expected results are in accordance with the recent proton internal pressure measurement. For energies above $s_0$, the model predicts a negative pressure region near the center of the hadron surrounded by a positive pressure region."

Once emitted by a source, the entity propagates within the space of Alice's and Bob's detection screens, with the measurements' outcomes corresponding to the entity being absorbed or not absorbed in a given time interval. The violation of the marginal laws results from the fact that the choice of the screen on the side of Alice affects the detection probability on the side of Bob, and vice versa, and we show that for certain screen choices the Bell-CHSH inequality can be violated up to its mathematical maximum. Our analysis provides a clarification of the mechanisms that could be at play when the Bell-CHSH inequality and marginal laws are violated in entangled bipartite systems, which would not primarily depend on the presence of a bipartite structure but on the fact that the latter can manifest as an undivided whole."

Here we report a deviation of chemical composition and distortion of lattice structure existing in the initial 3 unit cells of SrVO3 films grown on SrTiO3 (001) from its bulk form, which shows a direct correlation to the thickness-dependent MIT. In-situ photoemission and scanning tunneling spectroscopy indicate a MIT at the critical thickness of ~3 unit cell (u.c.), which coincides with the formation of a (root2Xroot2)R45 surface reconstruction. However, atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy show depletion of Sr, change of V valence, thus implying the existence of a significant amount of oxygen vacancies in the 3 u.c. of SrVO3 near the interface. Transport and magneto-transport measurements further reveal that disorder, rather than electron correlations, is likely to be the main cause for the MIT in the SrVO3 ultrathin films."

The state-of-the-art SR methods usually adopt a feed-forward pipeline to establish a non-linear mapping between low-res(LR) and high-res(HR) images. However, due to treating all image regions equally without considering the difficulty diversity, these approaches meet an upper bound for optimization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SR approach that discriminately processes each image region within an image by its difficulty. Specifically, we propose a dual-way SR network that one way is trained to focus on easy image regions and another is trained to handle hard image regions. To identify whether a region is easy or hard, we propose a novel image difficulty recognition network based on PSNR prior. Our SR approach that uses the region mask to adaptively enforce the dual-way SR network yields superior results. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks (e.g., Set5, Set14, BSD100, and Urban100) show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Chiral and deconfinement transitions are examined.

Thus a detailed exploration of Majorana finite frequency noise spectra, preferably in a nonequilibrium device, is a timely challenge of fundamental importance. Here we present results on finite frequency differential noise that is the derivative of the noise with respect to the frequency. This quantity has universal units of $e^2$ and scans in high detail all peculiarities of the Majorana noise clearly demonstrating its universal finite frequency features. In particular, we provide photon absorption spectra on all energy scales and reveal a rich structure including universal Majorana plateaus as well as universal Majorana resonances and antiresonances at characteristic frequencies.

This geometrically frustrated lattice consists of two kagome layers connected by a triangular-lattice linking layer. By combining Monte Carlo with precessional spin dynamics simulations, we compute the dynamical structure factor of the classical spin liquid in kagome bilayer and investigate the thermal and dilution effects. While the low frequency and long wavelength dynamics of the cooperative paramagnetic phase is dominated by spin diffusion, weak magnon excitations persist at higher energies, giving rise the half moon pattern in the dynamical structure factor. In the presence of spin vacancies, the dynamical properties of the diluted system can be understood within the two population picture. The spin diffusion of the ""correlated"" spin clusters is mainly driven by the zero-energy weather-van modes, giving rise to an autocorrelation function that decays exponentially with time. On the other hand, the diffusive dynamics of the quasi-free ""orphan"" spins leads to a distinctive longer time power-law tail in the autocorrelation function. We discuss the implications of our work for the glassy behaviors observed in the archetypal frustrated magnet SrCr$_{9p}$Ga$_{12-9p}$O$_{19}$ (SCGO)."

To achieve this, we use thousands of 3D scans to train a new, unified, 3D model of the human body, SMPL-X, that extends SMPL with fully articulated hands and an expressive face. Learning to regress the parameters of SMPL-X directly from images is challenging without paired images and 3D ground truth. Consequently, we follow the approach of SMPLify, which estimates 2D features and then optimizes model parameters to fit the features. We improve on SMPLify in several significant ways: (1) we detect 2D features corresponding to the face, hands, and feet and fit the full SMPL-X model to these; (2) we train a new neural network pose prior using a large MoCap dataset; (3) we define a new interpenetration penalty that is both fast and accurate; (4) we automatically detect gender and the appropriate body models (male, female, or neutral); (5) our PyTorch implementation achieves a speedup of more than 8x over Chumpy. We use the new method, SMPLify-X, to fit SMPL-X to both controlled images and images in the wild. We evaluate 3D accuracy on a new curated dataset comprising 100 images with pseudo ground-truth. This is a step towards automatic expressive human capture from monocular RGB data. The models, code, and data are available for research purposes at https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de."

Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we present an empirical study that ablates various spatial attention elements within a generalized attention formulation, encompassing the dominant Transformer attention as well as the prevalent deformable convolution and dynamic convolution modules. Conducted on a variety of applications, the study yields significant findings about spatial attention in deep networks, some of which run counter to conventional understanding. For example, we find that the query and key content comparison in Transformer attention is negligible for self-attention, but vital for encoder-decoder attention. A proper combination of deformable convolution with key content only saliency achieves the best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in self-attention. Our results suggest that there exists much room for improvement in the design of attention mechanisms."

We introduce an external field $\lambda$ that controls the partition function topology, allowing us to define a notion of nonequilibrium work as $\lambda$ is varied smoothly. Nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems of the work provide us with statistically exact estimates of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. This framework also naturally leads to the idea of using quench functions with spatially smooth profiles, providing us a way to average over lattice scale features of the entanglement entropy while preserving long distance universal information. We use these ideas to extract universal information from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of SU(N) spin models in one and two dimensions. The vast gain in efficiency of this method allows us to access unprecedented system sizes up to 192 x 96 spins for the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet."

Important progress has been made on the standard Laplacian dissipation case $\alpha=1$. This paper discovers that there are new phenomena with the case $\alpha<1$.

We establish that, for $\alpha<1$, any initial data $(u_0, b_0)$ in the inhomogeneous Besov space $B^\sigma_{2,\infty}(\mathbb R^d)$ with $\sigma> 1+\frac{d}{2}-\alpha$ leads to a unique local solution. For the case $\alpha\ge 1$, $u_0$ in the homogeneous Besov space $\mathring B^{1+\frac{d}{2}-2\alpha}_{2,1}(\mathbb R^d)$ and $b_0$ in $ \mathring B^{1+\frac{d}{2}-\alpha}_{2,1}(\mathbb R^d)$ guarantees the existence and uniqueness.

In addition, ezBFT minimizes the potentially negative effect of a byzantine replica on the overall system performance. We developed ezBFT's formal specification in TLA+, show that it provides the classic properties of BFT protocols including consistency, stability, and liveness, and developed an implementation.

For pathological diagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assumption is that the importance of the magnifications depends on the characteristics of the input image, such as cancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be useful for identifying the subtypes. It outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in experiments."

The annotations were collected using a novel crowdsourcing approach with multiple workers per sentence to capture inter-annotator disagreement. In contrast to the typical approach of attributing the best single frame to each word, we provide a list of frames with disagreement-based scores that express the confidence with which each frame applies to the word. This is based on the idea that inter-annotator disagreement is at least partly caused by ambiguity that is inherent to the text and frames. We have found many examples where the semantics of individual frames overlap sufficiently to make them acceptable alternatives for interpreting a sentence. We have argued that ignoring this ambiguity creates an overly arbitrary target for training and evaluating natural language processing systems - if humans cannot agree, why would we expect the correct answer from a machine to be any different? To process this data we also utilized an expanded lemma-set provided by the Framester system, which merges FN with WordNet to enhance coverage. Our dataset includes annotations of 1,000 sentence-word pairs whose lemmas are not part of FN. Finally we present metrics for evaluating frame disambiguation systems that account for ambiguity."

Their binding energy on amorphous CO ice shows broad distributions, with approximative average values of 500 K for HCO and 200 K for CH$_3$. If they are located on the surface close to each other (3 to 4 \AA), molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory show that they can form acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) or CH$_4$ + CO in barrier-less reactions, depending on the initial orientation of the molecules with respect to each other. In some orientations, no spontaneous reactions were found, the products remained bound to the surface. Sufficient configurational sampling, inclusion of the vibrational zero point energy, and a thorough benchmark of the applied electronic structure method are important to predict reliable binding energies for such weakly interacting systems. From these results it is clear that complex organic molecules, like acetaldehyde, can be formed by recombination reactions of radicals on CO surfaces."

Because of its radio brightness ($\nu F_{\nu} \approx 6 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this transient likely represents a secondary black hole in orbit around the AGN. Using {\it Chandra} ACIS observations from 2015 to 2017, we have looked for an X-ray counterpart to Cygnus A-2. The separation of 0.42 arcsec means that Cygnus A-2 can not be spatially resolved, but by comparing the data with simulated \texttt{marx} data, we put an upper limit to the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of Cygnus A-2 of $1 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using the Fundamental Plane for accreting black holes, we find that our upper limit to the X-ray flux of Cygnus A-2 in 2015-2017 disfavours the interpretation of Cygnus A-2 as a steadily accreting black hole. We suggest instead that Cygnus A-2 is the radio afterglow of a tidal disruption event (TDE), and that a peak in the 2-10 keV luminosity of the nuclear region in 2013, when it was observed by {\it Swift} and {\it NuSTAR}, is X-ray emission from the TDE. A TDE could naturally explain the X-ray light curve of the nuclear region, as well as the appearance of a short-lived, fast, and ionized outflow previously detected in the 2013 {\it NuSTAR} spectrum. Both the radio and X-ray luminosities fall in between typical luminosities for 'thermal' and 'jetted' TDE types, suggesting that Cygnus A-2 would be unlike previously seen TDE's."

Since the partial decay width for $B\rightarrow K X(3915)$ is at least an order-of-magnitude larger than that for $B\rightarrow K\chi_{c2}$, its assignment as the $\chi_{c2}^\prime$ is dubious."

From analysis using several methods, we obtain a reverberation lag of $\tau_{\rm H\beta}=37.2^{+4.5}_{-4.9}\,$ days. Taking a virial factor of $f_{_{\rm BLR}}=1$, we find a black hole mass of $M_{\bullet}=9.30_{-1.38}^{+1.26}\times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ from the mean spectra. The accretion rate is estimated to be $203.9_{-65.8}^{+61.0}\,L_{\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, suggesting a super-Eddington accretor, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$ is the speed of light. By decomposing {\it Hubble Space Telescope} images, we find that the stellar mass of the bulge of its host galaxy is $\log (M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\odot}) = \rm 10.92\pm 0.07$. This leads to a black hole to bulge mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$, which is significantly smaller than that of classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. After subtracting the host contamination from the observed luminosity, we find that I Zw 1 follows the empirical $R_{\rm BLR}\propto L_{5100}^{1/2}$ relation."

It was argued that this fact can be traced back to the fundamental dichotomy between matter and geometry, which is at the heart of Einstein's field equations. As a further study of this issue, we investigate here the general link between spacetime thermodynamics and Weyl transformations from two other angles. We first examine the conformal behaviour of the horizon entropy within Wald's approach based on the fundamental diffeomorphism symmetry of $pure$ geometry. We then revisit $-$ using Weyl transformations $-$ Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's field equations, the starting point of which is precisely built on the fundamental dichotomy between matter and geometry. As a result, we show that in order for Jacobson's approach to be able to yield the right Einstein field equations in the conformal frame, a specific conformal behavior of the horizon temperature and its entropy $-$ different from what Wald's approach implies $-$ is required. The two approaches to spacetime thermodynamics become thus incompatible in the conformal frame. In addition, we show $-$ in greater detail in the conformal frame $-$ that in the presence of a null dust the thermodynamics approach for extracting Einstein's field equations necessarily fails. An extensive discussion of the whole issue is given."

Here, a flip operation exchanges the edges in an alternating cycle of length four. We are interested in the complexity of this decision problem from the viewpoint of graph classes. We first prove that the problem is PSPACE-complete even for split graphs and for bipartite graphs of bounded bandwidth with maximum degree five. We then investigate polynomial-time solvable cases. Specifically, we prove that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for strongly orderable graphs (that include interval graphs and strongly chordal graphs), for outerplanar graphs, and for cographs (also known as $P_4$-free graphs). Furthermore, for each yes-instance from these graph classes, we show that a linear number of flip operations is sufficient and we can exhibit a corresponding sequence of flip operations in polynomial time."

The proposal generalizes classical duration models to a situation where slope coefficients can vary with the elapsed duration, and is suitable for discrete, continuous or mixed outcomes. Given that in general distribution regression coefficients do not have clear economic interpretation, we also propose consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for the average distribution marginal effects. Finite sample properties of the proposed method are studied by means of Monte Carlo experiments. Finally, we apply our proposed tools to study the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration. Our results suggest that, on average, an increase in unemployment benefits is associated with a nonlinear, non-monotone effect on the unemployment duration distribution and that such an effect is more pronounced for workers subjected to liquidity constraints."

However, they are based on the assumption that latent positions can be captured just by modeling word-frequency information from the different documents under study. We challenge this by presenting a new semantically aware unsupervised scaling algorithm, SemScale, which relies upon distributional representations of the documents under study. We conduct an extensive quantitative analysis over a collection of speeches from the European Parliament in five different languages and from two different legislations, in order to understand whether a) an approach that is aware of semantics would better capture known underlying political dimensions compared to a frequency-based scaling method, b) such positioning correlates in particular with a specific subset of linguistic traits, compared to the use of the entire text, and c) these findings hold across different languages. To support further research on this new branch of text scaling approaches, we release the employed dataset and evaluation setting, an easy-to-use online demo, and a Python implementation of SemScale."

The catalog contains positions, distances, luminosities, metallicites, and horizontal-branch morphology indices for 157~globular clusters, as well as space velocities for 72~globular clusters. For 69~globular clusters, these data are suppleented with the relative abundances of 28~chemical elements produced in various nuclear-synthesis processes, taken from 101~papers published between 1986 and 2018. The tendency for redder horizontal branches in low-metallicity accreted globular clusters is discussed. The discrepancy between the criteria for cluster membership in the thick-disk and halo subsystems based on chemical and kinematic properties is considered. This is manifest through the fact that all metal-rich ($\rm{[Fe/H]} > -1.0$) clusters are located close to the center and plane of the Galaxy, regardless of their kinematic membership in particular Galaxy subsystems. An exception is three accreted clusters lost by a dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius. At the same time, the fraction of more distant clusters is high among metal-poorer clusters in any kinematically selected Galactic subsystem."

In this work, we explore an alternative approach where spin-orbit coupling is induced artificially through a non-uniform magnetic field that originates from an array of micromagnets. Using a recently developed optimization algorithm, we find suitable micromagnet geometries for the emergence of topological superconductivity in a one-dimensional wire without intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We confirm the robustness of Majorana bound states against micromagnet nanofabrication errors, and identify low g-factor materials commonly used in mesoscopic physics experiments as viable candidates for Majorana devices."

This problem is generalized in this work for open dynamics where the stationary reduced density matrix is found by solving a master equation, derived for weak test particle-environment interactions. The goal is to assess the effects of decoherence and dissipative forces on the equilibrium state, with special attention payed to universal relations, obtained in the infinitesimal system-environment interaction limit. The pure plane waves are generalized into two directions, to propagating and to tunneling states, by constructing the desired representations of translations. The relaxed bound states of the Dirac delta potential cover a large class of states and the adiabatic turning on the environment interactions is used to find the relaxed final state of the usual pure bound state. The spread of the wave packet is studied by the help of the probability distribution of the coordinate and the probability flux and some fingerprints of the environment are pointed out."

By modeling a non-stationary spatio-temporal process as a piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process, we consider simultaneous estimation of the number and locations of change-points, and model parameters in each segment. A composite likelihood-based criterion is developed for change-point and parameters estimation. Asymptotic theories including consistency and distribution of the estimators are derived under mild conditions. In contrast to classical results in fixed dimensional time series that the asymptotic error of change-point estimator is $O_{p}(1)$, exact recovery of true change-points is guaranteed in the spatio-temporal setting. More surprisingly, the consistency of change-point estimation can be achieved without any penalty term in the criterion function. A computational efficient pruned dynamic programming algorithm is developed for the challenging criterion optimization problem. Simulation studies and an application to U.S. precipitation data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method."

We further extend tg-hyperbolicity to several classes of non-alternating virtual links. We then consider bounds on volumes of virtual links and include a table for volumes of the 116 nontrivial virtual knots of four or fewer crossings, all of which, with the exception of the trefoil knot, turn out to be tg-hyperbolic."

An analytical approach, based on Dirac equation, is implemented to obtain the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the charge carrier in three regions. Using the transfer matrix method, we determine the spin-dependent transmission in the presence of an applied strain along the armchair and zigzag directions of the graphene sample. We find that the strain remarkably modifies the Landau levels (LLs) originating from the applied $B$. It is shown that the spin up/down energy bands, in the first region, are shifted by the exchange $H_{ex}$ and left the whole spectrum linear as in the case of pristine graphene. In the central region, the position of the Dirac point changes due to the uniaxial strain and $B$. It is also found that the uniaxial strain in graphene induces a contraction of the LLs spectra. Moreover, the strain and $B$ modify the shape and position of some peaks in the transmission probabilities."

This model uses pairs of images and poses, which are passed through an encoder--decoder model for disparity estimation. The novelty lies in soft-constraining the bottleneck layer by a nonparametric Gaussian process prior. We propose a pose-kernel structure that encourages similar poses to have resembling latent spaces. The flexibility of the Gaussian process (GP) prior provides adapting memory for fusing information from previous views. We train the encoder--decoder and the GP hyperparameters jointly end-to-end. In addition to a batch method, we derive a lightweight estimation scheme that circumvents standard pitfalls in scaling Gaussian process inference, and demonstrate how our scheme can run in real-time on smart devices."

The current email system allows any attacker who gains access to your email to prove the authenticity of the stolen messages to third parties -- a property arising from a necessary anti-spam / anti-spoofing protocol called DKIM. This exacerbates the problem of email breaches by greatly increasing the potential for attackers to damage the users' reputation, blackmail them, or sell the stolen information to third parties.   In this paper, we introduce ""non-attributable email"", which guarantees that a wide class of adversaries are unable to convince any third party of the authenticity of stolen emails. We formally define non-attributability, and present two practical system proposals -- KeyForge and TimeForge -- that provably achieve non-attributability while maintaining the important protection against spam and spoofing that is currently provided by DKIM. Moreover, we implement KeyForge and demonstrate that that scheme is practical, achieving competitive verification and signing speed while also requiring 42% less bandwidth per email than RSA2048."

Though some non-invasive approaches have been developed, they are less accurate than invasive methods, resulting in an unmet need for more accurate non-invasive methods. Here, we show that deep learning-based algorithms can detect anemia and quantify several related blood measurements using retinal fundus images both in isolation and in combination with basic metadata such as patient demographics. On a validation dataset of 11,388 patients from the UK Biobank, our algorithms achieved a mean absolute error of 0.63 g/dL (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.64) in quantifying hemoglobin concentration and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.89) in detecting anemia. This work shows the potential of automated non-invasive anemia screening based on fundus images, particularly in diabetic patients, who may have regular retinal imaging and are at increased risk of further morbidity and mortality from anemia."

We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: 1) the relative mass function and 2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions, and the detection limits on lower-mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that 1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of $N\propto M^{-1.3\pm0.3}$, and consequently, 2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected sub-stellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets."

We present neutron diffraction data for Ca$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$Co$_{2-y}$As$_{2}$ that reveal a sequence of $x$-dependent magnetic transitions which involve different stacking of $2$D ferromagnetically-aligned layers with different magnetic anisotropy.

Not only is the complexity of such FC network, measured in number of trainable parameters and scalar multiplications, much lower than the reference FC and residual models, its accuracy also outperforms both models for nearly all tested SNR values (0 dB to 50dB). Such AE-trained networks are suited for in-situ protocol inference performed by simple mobile devices based on noisy signal measurements.

We detect the presence of a narrow Fe K$\alpha$ emission line along with a broad band Compton reflection hump at energies $E>10 \rm \, keV$. These are consistent with reflected emission of hard X-ray photons off a Compton thick material of $N_{\rm H} \ge 2.15\times 10^{24} \rm cm^{-2}$. In addition we detect a partially covering ionized absorption with ionization parameter $\log(\xi/\rm erg\, cm\, s^{-1})=1.9_{-0.5}^{+0.1}$, column density $N_{\rm H}=(5.6_{-1.9}^{+2.0})\times 10^{22}\rm cm^{-2}$ and a covering factor of $0.22_{-0.06}^{+0.09}$. We detect the presence of emission arising out of ionized disk reflection contributing in the soft and the hard X-rays consistently in all the observations. We however, could not definitely ascertain the presence of a relativistically broadened Fe line in the X-ray spectra. Using relativistic reflection model, we found that the data are unable to statistically distinguish between the scenarios when the super-massive black hole is non-rotating and when it is maximally spinning. Using the disk reflection model we also find that the accretion disk of the AGN may be truncated at a distance $6R_{\rm G}<R<12R_{\rm G}$, which may suggest why there may not be any broad Fe line. The Eddington rate of the source is low ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=0.03$), which points to an inefficient accretion, possibly due to a truncated disk."

The resulting screening of the impurity's local moment by the electron Fermi sea is characterized by a Kondo temperature $T_K$, below which the system enters a non-perturbative strongly-coupled regime. In recent years, this effect has found its realizations beyond the bulk-metal paradigm in many other itinerant-electron systems, such as quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures and in nanomaterials, quantum point contacts, and graphene. Here we report on the first experimental observation of the Kondo screening by chargeless quasiparticles. This occurs in a charge-insulating quantum spin liquid, where spinon excitations forming a Fermi surface take the role of conduction electrons. The observed impurity behaviour therefore bears a strong resemblance to the conventional case in a metal. The discovered spinon-based Kondo effect provides a prominent platform for characterising and possibly manipulating enigmatic host spin liquids."

The first puzzle is, given incentives, the extent of bunching of labour market exits at legislated state pension ages (SPA) seems incompatible with rational expectations. Adding to the evidence for this puzzle, I include an empirical analysis focusing on whether liquidity constraints can explain this bunching and find they cannot. The nature of this puzzle is clarified by exploring a life-cycle model with rational agents that matches aggregate profiles. This model succeeds in matching aggregates by overestimating the impact of the SPA on poorer individuals whilst underestimating its impact on wealthier people. The second puzzle is people are often mistaken about their own pension provisions. Concerning the second puzzle, I incorporate rational inattention to the SPA into the aforementioned life-cycle model, allowing for mistaken beliefs. To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first not only to incorporate rational inattention into a life-cycle model but also to assess a rationally inattentive model against non-experimental individual choice data. This facilitates another important contribution: discipling the cost of attention with subjective belief data. Preliminary results indicate rational inattention improves the aggregate fit and better matches the response of participation to the SPA across the wealth distribution, hence offering a resolution to the first puzzle. The third puzzle is despite actuarially advantageous options to defer receipt of pension benefits, take up is extremely low. An extension of the model generates an explanation of this last puzzle: the actuarial calculations implying deferral is preferable ignore the utility cost of tracking your pension which can be avoided by claiming. These puzzles are researched in the context of the reform to the UK female SPA."

The hunting of new particles and the measurement of their properties or the research of rare processes are sought to understand if the measurements confirm the Standard Model and to look for physics beyond it. The detectors ensure the reconstruction of events belonging to the sub-atomic domain. The operation and the efficiency of the BESIII inner tracker is compromised due to the the radiation level of the apparatus. A new detector is needed to guarantee better performance and to improve the physics research. A cylindrical triple-GEM detector (CGEM) is an answer to this need: it will maintain the excellent performance of the inner tracker while improving the spatial resolution in the beam direction allowing a better reconstruction of secondary vertices. The technological challenge of the CGEM is related in its spatial limitation and the needed cylindrical shape. At the same time the detector has to ensure an efficiency close to 1 and a stable spatial resolution better than 150 $\mu$m, independently from the track incident angle and the presence of 1 T magnetic field. In the years 2014-2018 the CGEM-IT has been designed and built. Through several test beam and simulations the optimal configuration from the geometrical and electrical points of view has been found. This allows to measure the position of the charged particle interacting with the CGEM-IT. Two algorithms have been used for this purpose, the charge centroid and the $\mu$TPC, a new technique introduced by ATLAS in MicroMegas and developed here for the first time for triple-GEM detector.

Expectation values for observables are taken with respect to an initial quasiclassical distribution that respects the original quantization of the occupation numbers. The proposed classical map becomes complete under the evolution of quadratic Hamiltonians and is extended for all even order observables. We show that the map provides an accurate description of the dynamics for an interacting quantum impurity model in the coulomb blockade regime, at both low and high temperatures. The numerical results are aided by a novel importance sampling scheme that employs a reference system to reduce significantly the sampling effort required to converge the classical calculations."

The standard nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is derived by using the reductive perturbation method to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) as well as their modulation instability. It is observed that the ion-acoustic dark (bright) envelope solitons are formed for modulationally stable (unstable) plasma region, and that the presence of highly dense super-thermal electrons and positrons enhances (reduces) this unstable (stable) region. It is also found that the effect of super-thermality of electron or positron species causes to increase the nonlinearity, and to fasten the formation of the bright envelope solitons. These results are applicable to both space and laboratory plasma systems for understanding the propagation of localized electrostatic disturbances."

These properties are absent in non-resonant low-index particles due to the strong overlap between dipolar and higher order multipolar contributions. Here we propose to induce duality and zero optical backscattering (first Kerker conditions) at multiple size parameter values on arbitrary dielectric spheres by illuminating with a tightly focused dipolar beam. As an illustrative example, we show that duality signatures, including topological optical vortices and enhanced spin orbit optical mirages, can be induced on arbitrary sized spheres of Polystyrene immersed in water."

In 2015, a new Multi-Round Multi-Run Deferred Acceptance joint seat allocation process was implemented, improving the efficiency and productivity of concerned stakeholders. The process brings all CFTIs under one umbrella for admissions: 100 institutes and approximately 39000 seats in 2018. In this scheme, each candidate submits a single choice list over all available programs, and receives no more than a single seat from the system, based on the choices and the ranks in the relevant merit lists. Significantly, overbooking of seats is forbidden.   In this report, we provide details of our safe, fair and optimal algorithm. Novel features include the ability to handle multiple merit lists, seat guarantee across multiple rounds, implementing reservation, and de-reservation rules, handling escalation of ranks due to a revision of marks by state boards during the allocation process, and dealing with last minute de-recognition of other backward caste categories. A notable rule required the allocation of supernumerary seats to females, provided the program did not have a sufficient desired percentage, while, at the same time, not reducing the number of seats available to non-females.   Looking forward, we posit first that it is inevitable that different colleges will prefer different mechanisms of judging merit, and assigning relative rank. We believe the ability of our algorithm to gracefully handle multiple merit lists gives us hope to express optimism that all undergraduate admissions in the country, beyond the CFTIs, can beneficially use the suggested scheme."

Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are among the most useful astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing fundamental physics, and place some of the most stringent constraints on this high-density EoS. Pulsar timing - the process of accounting for every rotation of a pulsar over long time periods - can precisely measure a wide variety of physical phenomena, including those that allow the measurement of the masses of the components of a pulsar binary system (Lorimer & Kramer 2005). One of these, called relativistic Shapiro delay (Shapiro 1964), can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems. By combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-year data set with recent orbital-phase-specific observations using the Green Bank Telescope, we have measured the mass of the MSP J0740+6620 to be $\mathbf{2.14^{+0.10}_{-0.09}}$ solar masses (68.3% credibility interval; 95.4% credibility interval is $\mathbf{2.14^{+0.20}_{-0.18}}$ solar masses). It is highly likely to be the most massive neutron star yet observed, and serves as a strong constraint on the neutron star interior EoS."

However, very little progress has been made in utilizing curiosity for learning control. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that combines Bayesian modeling of the system dynamics with curious iLQR, an iterative LQR approach that considers model uncertainty. During trajectory optimization the curious iLQR attempts to minimize both the task-dependent cost and the uncertainty in the dynamics model. We demonstrate the approach on reaching tasks with 7-DoF manipulators in simulation and on a real robot. Our experiments show that MBRL with curious iLQR reaches desired end-effector targets more reliably and with less system rollouts when learning a new task from scratch, and that the learned model generalizes better to new reaching tasks."

While ranking or selecting patterns is well-studied for itemsets it is surprisingly under-researched for other, more complex, pattern types.   In this paper we propose a new quality measure for episodes. An episode is essentially a set of events with possible restrictions on the order of events. We say that an episode is significant if its occurrence is abnormally compact, that is, only few gap events occur between the actual episode events, when compared to the expected length according to the independence model. We can apply this measure as a post-pruning step by first discovering frequent episodes and then rank them according to this measure.   In order to compute the score we will need to compute the mean and the variance according to the independence model. As a main technical contribution we introduce a technique that allows us to compute these values. Such a task is surprisingly complex and in order to solve it we develop intricate finite state machines that allow us to compute the needed statistics. We also show that asymptotically our score can be interpreted as a P-value. In our experiments we demonstrate that despite its intricacy our ranking is fast: we can rank tens of thousands episodes in seconds. Our experiments with text data demonstrate that our measure ranks interpretable episodes high."

We show that after appropriate arbitrary small deformation of the initial metric, the null spaces of the Chern-Ricci two-form generate a holomorphic, integrable distribution. This distribution induces an isometric, holomorphic, almost free action of a complex Lie group on the universal cover of the manifold. Our proof combines the strong maximum principle for the Hermitian Curvature Flow (HCF), new results on the interplay of the HCF and the torsion-twisted connection, and observations on the geometry of the torsion-twisted connection on a general Hermitian manifold."

In general, 30 evolutionary tracks of the horizontal branch stars were computed. Selected models of evolutionary sequences were used as initial conditions for solution of the equations of hydrodynamics that describe radial stellar oscillations. Hydrodynamic models of RR Lyr type stars were computed for the core helium burning stage as well as for the preceding pre--ZAHB stage. Analytic relations for the effective temperature of the instability strip edges as a function of stellar luminosity are obtained. Theoretical histograms of the period distribution of RR Lyr type variables were produced for each evolutionary sequence using Monte--Carlo simulations based on the consistent stellar evolution and nonlinear stellar pulsation calculations. A satisfactory agreement with observations (i.e. the greater number of RRab variables) was found for the evolutionary sequence $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 0.811M_\odot$, $\eta_\mathrm{R}=0.55$ with the number fraction of fundamental mode pulsators $\approx 75\%$. At the same time the mean period of fundamental mode pulsators ($\langle\Pi\rangle_0=0.79$ day) is substantially greater compared to the observational estimate of $\langle\Pi\rangle_\mathrm{ab}$."

We show that independent of the symmetry breaking pattern, a topologically stable superheavy monopole carrying a single unit of Dirac charge as well as color magnetic charge is always present. Lighter intermediate mass topologically stable monopoles carrying two or three quanta of Dirac charge can appear in $SO(10)$ and $E_6$ models respectively. These lighter monopoles as well as topologically stable intermediate scale strings can survive an inflationary epoch. We also show the appearance of a novel necklace configuration in $SO(10)$ broken to the Standard Model via $SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$. It consists of $SU(4)_c$ and $SU(2)_R$ monopoles connected by flux tubes. Necklaces consisting of monopoles and antimonopoles joined together by flux tubes are also identified. Even in the absence of topologically stable strings, a monopole-string system can temporarily appear. This system decays by emitting gravity waves and we provide an example in which the spectrum of these waves is strongly peaked around $10^{-4}~{\rm Hz}$ with $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^2\simeq 10^{-12}$.

For the complete membership selection of MBM 110, we also analyze WISE mid-infrared data and Gaia astrometric data. Membership of individual stars is critically evaluated using the data mentioned above. The Gaia parallax of stars in MBM 110 is 2.667 +/- 0.095 mas (d = 375 +/- 13 pc), which confirms that MBM 110 is a small star-forming region in the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. The age of MBM 110 is between 1.9 Myr and 3.1 Myr depending on the adopted pre-main sequence evolution model. The total stellar mass of MBM 110 is between 16 M_sun (members only) and 23 M_sun (including probable members). The star formation efficiency is estimated to be about 1.4%. We discuss the importance of such small star formation regions in the context of the global star formation rate and suggest that a galaxy's star formation rate calculated from the Halpha luminosity may underestimate the actual star formation rate. We also confirm a young brown dwarf member based on photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry."

They are full-stack systems where security is a critical factor for their success. The main focus of this work is to systematize knowledge about security and privacy issues of blockchains. To this end, we propose a security reference architecture based on models that demonstrate the stacked hierarchy of various threats (similar to the ISO/OSI hierarchy) as well as threat-risk assessment using ISO/IEC 15408. In contrast to the previous surveys, we focus on the categorization of security incidents based on their origins and using the proposed architecture we present existing prevention and mitigation techniques. The scope of our work mainly covers aspects related to the decentralized nature of blockchains, while we mention common operational security issues and countermeasures only tangentially."

It is shown that the mapping from the (logarithm of) the conductivity, i.e. the (logarithm of) the coefficient in the divergence term of the studied elliptic partial differential equation, to the logarithm of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map is continuously Fr\'echet differentiable between natural topologies. Moreover, for any essentially bounded perturbation of the conductivity, the Fr\'echet derivative defines a bounded linear operator on the space of square integrable functions living on the domain boundary, although the logarithm of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map itself is unbounded in that topology. In particular, it follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus that the difference between the logarithms of any two Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps is always bounded on the space of square integrable functions. All aforementioned results also hold if the Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map is replaced by its inverse, i.e. the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map."

One of the simplest phenomenological models for investigating basic properties of adaptive networks is the system of coupled phase oscillators with adaptive couplings. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of this system. We extend recent results on the appearance of hierarchical frequency-multi-clusters by investigating the effect of the time-scale separation. We show that the slow adaptation in comparison with the fast phase dynamics is necessary for the emergence of the multi-clusters and their stability. Additionally, we study the role of double antipodal clusters, which appear to be unstable for all considered parameter values. We show that such states can be observed for a relatively long time, i.e., they are metastable. A geometrical explanation for such an effect is based on the emergence of a heteroclinic orbit."

Many of these concepts naturally extend the classical automata and logics over words, which provide a framework for modeling sequential systems. A distributed system, on the other hand, combines several (finite or recursive) processes, and will therefore be modeled as a collection of (finite or pushdown, respectively) automata. A crucial parameter of a distributed system is the kind of interaction that is allowed between processes. In this lecture, we focus on the message-passing paradigm. In general, communication in a distributed system creates complex dependencies between events, which are hidden when using a sequential, operational semantics. The approach taken here is based on a faithful preservation of the dependencies of concurrent events. That is, an execution of a system is modeled as a partial order, or graph, rather than a sequence of events."

Monte carlo rule is an organic combination of the current dynamic rules of individual policy adjustment, which not only makes full use of information but also reflects the individual's bounded rational behavior and the ambivalence between the pursuit of high returns and high risks. In addition, it also reflects the individual's behavioral execution preferences.   The implementation of monte carlo rule brings an extremely good result, higher cooperation level and stronger robustness are achieved by comparing with the unconditional imitation rule, replicator dynamics rule and fermi rule.   When analyse the equilibrium density of cooperators as a function of the temptation to defect, it appears a smooth transition between the mixed state of coexistence of cooperators and defectors and the pure state of defectors when enhancing the temptation, which can be perfectly characterized by the trigonometric behavior instead of the power-law behavior discovered in the pioneer's work.   When discuss the relationship between the temptation to defect and the average returns of cooperators and defectors, it is found that cooperators' average returns is almost a constant throughout the whole temptation parameter ranges while defectors' decreases as the growth of temptation.   Additionally, the insensitivity of cooperation level to the initial density of cooperators and the sensitivity to the social population have been both demonstrated."

Both are preceded by modelling of the observed VLBI jet structure with a simple Gaussian templates. We propose to infer the jets parameters using the inhomogeneous jet model directly - bypassing the modelling of the source structure with a Gaussian templates or image deconvolution. We applied Bayesian analysis to multi-frequency VLBA observations of radio galaxy NGC 315 and found that its parsec-scale jet is well described by the inhomogeneous conical model. Our results favour electron-positron jet. We also detected a component in a counter jet. Its position implies the presence of an external absorber with a steep density gradient at close ($r=0.1$ pc) distance from the central engine.

A equivalence between hydrodynamics and U(1) gauge theory, which is newly proposed in the present paper, develops the quasiparticle description to construct a new Lagrangian which correctly reproduces the number of modes at the melting points and at the critical points. The heat capacity evaluated from this Lagrangian naturally interpolates between these two points, and agrees with the phonon theory of liquids [Sci. Rep. 2, 421 (2012)]."

Their geoeffectiveness is largely determined by their dynamic pressure and internal magnetic fields, for which reliable predictions at Earth are not possible with traditional cone CME models. We study two Earth-directed CMEs using the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) model, testing the predictive capabilities of a linear force-free spheromak CME model initialised using parameters derived from remote-sensing observations. Using observation-based CME input parameters, we perform MHD simulations of the events with the cone and spheromak CME models. Results show that spheromak CMEs propagate faster than cone CMEs when initialised with the same kinematic parameters. We interpret these differences as due to different Lorentz forces acting within cone and spheromak CMEs, leading to different CME expansions. Such discrepancies can be mitigated by initialising spheromak CMEs with a reduced speed corresponding to the radial speed only. Results at Earth evidence that the spheromak model improves the predictions of B(Bz) up to 12-60(22-40) percentage points compared to a cone model. Considering virtual spacecraft located around Earth, B(Bz) predictions reach 45-70%(58-78%) of the observed peak values. The spheromak model predicts inaccurate magnetic field parameters at Earth for CMEs propagating away from the Sun-Earth line, while it successfully predicts the CME properties and arrival time in the case of strictly Earth-directed events. Modelling CMEs propagating away from the Sun-Earth line requires extra care due to limitations related to the assumed spherical shape. The spatial variability of modelling results and the typical uncertainties in the reconstructed CME direction advocate the need to consider predictions at Earth and at virtual spacecraft around it."

Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack Squeeze Coded Computation ($S^2C^2$). $S^2C^2$ squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate $S^2C^2$ on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using $S^2C^2$ compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how $S^2C^2$ can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication."

Our data include detections of mid to high J CO transitions (J=4-3 to J=13-12) and the [CI] (1-0) and (2-1) emission lines. CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) for our ETGs indicate low gas excitation, barring NGC 1266. We use the [CI] emission lines to determine the excitation temperature of the neutral gas, as well as estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen. The masses agree well with masses derived from CO, making this technique very promising for high redshift galaxies. We do not find a trend between the [NII] 205 flux and the infrared luminosity, but we do find that the [NII] 205/CO(6-5) line ratio is correlated with the 60/100 $\mu$m Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) colors. Thus the [NII] 205/CO(6-5) ratio can be used to infer a dust temperature, and hence the intensity of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Photodissociation region (PDR) models show that use of [CI] and CO lines in addition to the typical [CII], [OI], and FIR fluxes drive the model solutions to higher densities and lower values of G$_0$. In short, the SPIRE lines indicate that the atomic and molecular gas in the CO-rich ETGs have similar properties to other galaxies. As might be expected from their low levels of star formation activity, the ETGs have rather low excitation CO SLEDs, low temperatures inferred from the [CI] lines, and modestly lower [CI]/CO ratios."

Additionally, we analyze how the conventional architecture, i.e. a fully connected layer attached after the convolutional part, encodes responses in a spatially variant way. In contrary, explicit spatial encoding is used in our descriptor, whose potential applications are not limited to local-patches. We evaluate the descriptor on standard benchmarks. Both versions, encoding 32x32 or 64x64 patches, consistently outperform all other methods on all benchmarks. The number of parameters of the model is independent of the input patch resolution."

However, there is very few works investigating its potential in real-world UAV applications. In this paper, we present an LGMD based competitive collision avoidance method for UAV indoor navigation. Compared to previous works, we divided the UAV's field of view into four subfields each handled by an LGMD neuron. Therefore, four individual competitive LGMDs (C-LGMD) compete for guiding the directional collision avoidance of UAV. With more degrees of freedom compared to ground robots and vehicles, the UAV can escape from collision along four cardinal directions (e.g. the object approaching from the left-side triggers a rightward shifting of the UAV). Our proposed method has been validated by both simulations and real-time quadcopter arena experiments."

The mergers were discovered using the new search pipeline described in Venumadhav et al. [Phys. Rev. D 100, 023011 (2019)], and are above the detection thresholds as defined in Abbott et al. (LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations) [Phys. Rev. X 9, 031040 (2019).] Three of the mergers (GW170121, GW170304, GW170727) have inferred probabilities of being of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} > 0.98$. The remaining three (GW170425, GW170202, GW170403) are less certain, with $p_{\rm astro}$ ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. The newly found mergers largely share the statistical properties of previously reported events, with the exception of GW170403, the least secure event, which has a highly negative effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$ . The most secure new event, GW170121 ($p_{\rm astro} > 0.99$), is also notable due to its inferred negative value of $\chi_{\rm eff}$, which is inconsistent with being positive at the ~95.8% confidence level. The new mergers nearly double the sample of gravitational wave events reported from O2, and present a substantial opportunity to explore the statistics of the binary black hole population in the Universe. The number of detected events is not surprising since we estimate that the detection volume of our pipeline may be larger than that of other pipelines by as much as a factor of two (with significant uncertainties in the estimate). The increase in volume is larger when the constituent detectors of the network have very different sensitivities, as is likely to be the case in current and future runs."

We report a high detection rate of up to ~80% of galaxies within 1000 km/s from DLAs and with impact parameters between 25 and 280 kpc. In particular, we discovered 5 high-confidence Lyman alpha emitters associated with three DLAs, plus up to 9 additional detections across five of the six fields. The majority of the detections are at relatively large impact parameters (>50 kpc) with two detections being plausible host galaxies. Among our detections, we report four galaxies associated with the most metal-poor DLA in our sample (Z/Z_sun = -2.33), which trace an overdense structure resembling a filament. By comparing our detections with predictions from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) cosmological simulations and a semi-analytic model designed to reproduce the observed bias of DLAs at z>2, we conclude that our observations are consistent with a scenario in which a significant fraction of DLAs trace the neutral regions within halos with a characteristic mass of 10^11-10^12 M_sun, in agreement with the inference made from the large-scale clustering of DLAs. We finally show how larger surveys targeting ~25 absorbers have the potential of constraining the characteristic masses of halos hosting high-redshift DLAs with sufficient accuracy to discriminate between different models."

Kepler-47 b (the ""inner planet"") has an orbital period of 49.5 days and a radius of about $3\,R_{\oplus}$. Kepler-47 c (the ""outer planet"") has an orbital period of 303.2 days and a radius of about $4.7\,R_{\oplus}$. Here we report the discovery of a third planet, Kepler-47 d (the ""middle planet""), which has an orbital period of 187.4 days and a radius of about $7\,R_{\oplus}$. The presence of the middle planet allows us to place much better constraints on the masses of all three planets, where the $1\sigma$ ranges are less than $26\,M_{\oplus}$, between $7-43\,M_{\oplus}$, and between $2-5\,M_{\oplus}$ for the inner, middle, and outer planets, respectively. The middle and outer planets have low bulk densities, with $\rho_{\rm middle} < 0.68$ g cm$^{-3}$ and $\rho_{\rm outer} < 0.26$ g cm$^{-3}$ at the $1\sigma$ level. The two outer planets are ""tightly packed,"" assuming the nominal masses, meaning no other planet could stably orbit between them. All of the orbits have low eccentricities and are nearly coplanar, disfavoring violent scattering scenarios and suggesting gentle migration in the protoplanetary disk."

In biological systems, often diverse species are simultaneously present and interact with each other. Here, we derive a (time-dependent) particle-scale statistical description, namely a dynamical density functional theory, for such multi-species systems, extending existing works on one-component microswimmer suspensions. In particular, our theory incorporates the effect of external potentials, but also steric and hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers. For the latter, a previously introduced force-dipole-based minimal (pusher or puller) microswimmer model is used. As a limiting case of our theory, mixtures of hydrodynamically interacting active and passive particles are captured as well. After deriving the theory, we apply it to different planar swimmer configurations. First, these are binary pusher--puller mixtures in external traps. In the considered situations, we find that the majority species imposes its behavior on the minority species. Second, for unconfined binary pusher--puller mixtures, the linear stability of an orientationally disordered state against the emergence of global polar orientational order (and thus emergent collective motion) is tested analytically. Our statistical approach predicts, qualitatively in line with previous particle-based computer simulations, a threshold for the fraction of pullers and for their propulsion strength that lets overall collective motion arise. Third, we let driven passive colloidal particles form the boundaries of a shear cell, with confined active microswimmers on their inside. Driving the passive particles then effectively imposes shear flows, which persistently acts on the inside microswimmers. Their resulting behavior reminds of the one of circle swimmers, though with varying swimming radii."

Since $M$ is rank $2$, $A$ is $2$-dimensional and we can parametrize these hypersurfaces via an angle $\alpha \in [0,\pi/2]$ determining the direction of $H$. We show that one of the hypersurfaces (corresponding to $\alpha = 0$) is minimally embedded and isometric to the non-symmetric $7$-dimensional Damek-Ricci space. We also provide an explicit formula for the Ricci curvature of these hypersurfaces and show that all hypersurfaces for $\alpha \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ admit planes of both negative and positive sectional curvature.

Unfortunately, existing formulations of DOT can model only types of the form $x.A$ which depend on variables rather than general paths. This restriction makes it impossible to model nested module dependencies. Nesting small components inside larger ones is a necessary ingredient of a modular, scalable language. DOT's variable restriction thus undermines its ability to fully formalize a variety of programming-language features including Scala's module system, family polymorphism, and covariant specialization.   This paper presents the pDOT calculus, which generalizes DOT to support types that depend on paths of arbitrary length, as well as singleton types to track path equality. We show that naive approaches to add paths to DOT make it inherently unsound, and present necessary conditions for such a calculus to be sound. We discuss the key changes necessary to adapt the techniques of the DOT soundness proofs so that they can be applied to pDOT. Our paper comes with a Coq-mechanized type-safety proof of pDOT. With support for paths of arbitrary length, pDOT can realize DOT's full potential for formalizing Scala-like calculi."

To facilitate learning, MOOC discussion forums exist where students and instructors communicate questions, answers, and thoughts related to the course.   The primary objective of this paper is to investigate tracing discussion forum posts back to course lecture videos and readings using topic analysis. We utilize both unsupervised and supervised variants of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics from course material and classify forum posts. We validate our approach on posts bootstrapped from five Coursera courses and determine that topic models can be used to map student discussion posts back to the underlying course lecture or reading. Labeled LDA outperforms unsupervised Hierarchical Dirichlet Process LDA and base LDA for our traceability task. This research is useful as it provides an automated approach for clustering student discussions by course material, enabling instructors to quickly evaluate student misunderstanding of content and clarify materials accordingly."

The simulations were performed at constant supersaturation by utilizing a recently proposed algorithm [Perego et al., J. Chem. Phys., 142, 2015, 144113]. To bring the crystal growth within the timescale of a molecular dynamics simulation we applied Well-Tempered Metadynamics with a spatially constrained collective variable, which focuses the sampling on the growing layer. We estimated that the resulting steady state crystal shape corresponds to a rhombic prism, which is in line with experiments. Further, we observed that at the investigated supersaturations, the $\{00\bar{1}\}$ face grows in a two step two dimensional nucleation mechanism while the considerably faster growing faces $\{1\bar{1}0\}$ and $\{20\bar{1}\}$ grow new layers with a one step two dimensional nucleation mechanism."

This slow time scale is fully encoded in the structure of the unjammed packing and can be readily measured via the vibrational density of states. We show that the corresponding dynamic critical exponent is the same for randomly generated and sheared packings.

Here we show that the hopfion's locally uncompensated emergent field leads to a topological Hall signature, although the topological Hall effect vanishes on the global level. The topological Hall signature is switchable by magnetic fields or electric currents and occurs independently of the anomalous and conventional Hall effects. It can therefore be exploited to electrically detect hopfions in experiments and even to distinguish them from other textures like skyrmion tubes. Furthermore, it can potentially be utilized in spintronic devices. Exemplarily, we propose a hopfion-based racetrack data storage device and simulate the electrical detection of the hopfions as carriers of information."

The magnetization measurements with using the powder sample reveal a large effective magnetic moment and a fairly strong antiferromagnetic interaction, indicating a deviation from the Kitaev model. Considering the relationship between magnetism and crystal structure in CdIrO$_3$ with comparing with the other ilmenite-type iridates ZnIrO$_3$ and MgIrO$_3$, we conclude that insulating CdIrO$_3$ cannot be describe as a $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Mott state owing to a metathetically-stabilized large trigonal distortion of IrO$_6$ octahedra."

The experimental spectra are compared with different interface-slab model systems using first-principle all electron full-potential calculations where the core states are treated fully relativistic. As shown in this work, the bulk sensitivity and element selectivity of X-ray spectroscopy enables to probe the symmetry and orbital directions at interfaces between cubic and hexagonal crystals. We show how the electronic structure develop from local octahedral bond symmetry of cubic ZrN that distorts for increasing Al content into more complex bonding. This results in three different kinds of bonding originating from semi-coherent interfaces with segregated ZrN and lamellar AlN nanocrystalline precipitates. An increasing chemical shift and charge transfer between the elements takes place with increasing Al content and affects the bond strength and increases resistivity."

Streming potential is the contribution due to the water flux in the subsurface and is of particular interest in hydrogeophysics and reservoir characterization. Being able to estimate water fluxes in porous and fractured media using streaming potential data relies on our understanding of the electrokinetic coupling at the mineral-solution interface and our capacity to understand, model, and upscale this phenomenon. Two main approaches have been proposed to predict streaming potential generation in geological media. One of these approaches is based on determining the excess charge which is effectively dragged in the medium by water flow. In this chapter, we describe how to model the streaming potential by considering this effective excess charge density, how it can be defined, calculated and upscaled. We provide a short overview of the theoretical basis of this approach and we describe different applications to both water saturated and partially saturated soils and fractured media."

It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy"

It is found that the skyrmion will move away from the center of the nanodisk if it is driven by a spin-polarized current; however, it will return to the initial position in the absence of stimulus. Therefore, we propose a skyrmion-based artificial spiking neuron, which can effectively implement the leaky-integrate-fire operation.

Atmospheric retrievals of transmission spectra are enabling comparative studies of exoplanet atmospheres. However, the atmospheric properties inferred by retrieval techniques display a significant anomaly: most retrieved temperatures are far colder than expected. In some cases, retrieved temperatures are ~1000 K colder than T_eq. Here, we provide an explanation for this conundrum. We demonstrate that erroneously cold temperatures result when 1D atmospheric models are applied to spectra of planets with differing morning-evening terminator compositions. Despite providing an acceptable fit, 1D retrieval techniques artificially tune atmospheric parameters away from terminator-averaged properties. Retrieved temperature profiles are hundreds of degrees cooler and have weaker temperature gradients than reality. Retrieved abundances are mostly biased by > 1$\sigma$ and sometimes by > 3$\sigma$, with the most extreme biases for ultra-hot Jupiters. When morning-evening compositional differences manifest for prominent opacity sources, H$_2$O abundances retrieved by 1D models can be biased by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that these biases provide an explanation for the cold retrieved temperatures reported for WASP-17b and WASP-12b. To overcome biases associated with 1D atmospheric models, there is an urgent need to develop multidimensional retrieval techniques."

On the surface of the magnet, we observe electronic wave functions that take the form of drumheads, enabling us to directly visualize the crucial components of the bulk-boundary topological correspondence.

The type systems derived from the two logics enforce communication correctness on the same class of pi-calculus processes, but they are significantly different. Caires, Pfenning and Toninho informally observed that, unlike the classical type system, the intuitionistic type system enforces locality for shared channels, i.e. received channels cannot be used for replicated input. In this paper, we revisit this observation from a formal standpoint. We develop United Linear Logic (ULL), a logic encompassing both classical and intuitionistic linear logic. Then, following the Curry-Howard correspondences for session types, we define piULL, a session type system for the pi-calculus based on ULL. Using piULL we can formally assess the difference between the intuitionistic and classical type systems, and justify the role of locality and symmetry therein."

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19."

Unlike most TMOs, minute doping in CaMnO3 induces a metallic state without any structural transformations. This material is thus an ideal platform to explore band formation through the MIT. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize how electrons delocalize and couple to phonons in CaMnO3. We show the development of a Fermi surface where mobile electrons coexist with heavier carriers, strongly coupled polarons. The latter originate from a boost of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI). This finding brings to light the role that the EPI can play in MITs even caused by purely electronic mechanisms. Our discovery of the EPI-induced dichotomy of the charge carriers explains the transport response of Ce-doped CaMnO3 and suggests strategies to engineer quantum matter from TMOs."

This leads to non-equilibrium growth conditions and dramatically shortens the lifetime of expensive Pt crucibles. Here, we report the growth of Sr2IrO4, Sr3Ir2O7 and SrIrO3 single crystals in a reproducible way by using anhydrous SrCl2 flux well below its boiling point. We show that the yield of the different phases strongly depends on the nutrient/solvent ratio for fixed soak temperature and cooling rate. Using this low-temperature growth approach generally leads to a lower temperature-independent contribution to the magnetic susceptibility than previously reported. Crystals of SrIrO3 exhibit a paramagnetic behavior that can be remarkably well fitted with a Curie-Weiss law yielding physically reasonable parameters, in contrast to previous reports. Hence, reducing the soak temperature below the solvent boiling point not only provides more stable and controllable growth conditions in contrast to previously reported growth protocols, but also extends considerably the lifetime of expensive platinum crucibles and reduces the corrosion of heating and thermoelements of standard furnaces, thereby reducing growth costs."

Supporting multiple IoT devices charging simultaneously is a significant feature of the RBC system. To optimize the multi-user charging performance, the transmitting power should be scheduled for charging all IoT devices simultaneously. In order to keep all IoT devices working as long as possible for fairness, we propose the First Access First Charge (FAFC) scheduling algorithm. Then, we formulate the scheduling parameters quantitatively for algorithm implementation. Finally, we analyze the performance of FAFC scheduling algorithm considering the impacts of the receiver number, the transmitting power and the charging time. Based on the analysis, we summarize the methods of improving the WPT performance for multiple IoT devices, which include limiting the receiver number, increasing the transmitting power, prolonging the charging time and improving the single-user's charging efficiency. The FAFC scheduling algorithm design and analysis provide a fair WPT solution for the multi-user RBC system."

Recently, we have demonstrated that the amplitude profiles - dependence of the amplitude $A$ on frequency $\Omega$ of the driving force, computed by asymptotic methods in implicit form as $F\left( A,\Omega \right) =0$, permit prediction of metamorphoses of dynamics which occur in neighbourhoods of singular points of the implicit curve $F\left( A,\Omega \right) =0$. In the present study we strive at a global view of singular points of the amplitude profiles computing bifurcation sets, i.e. sets containing all points in the parameter space for which the amplitude profile has a singular point."

These are often chosen in order to attribute physical properties to a particular choice of coordinates, or otherwise to simplify the form of the resultant equations. Calculations are then performed with the understanding that they could have been done in any gauge, and that transformations between different gauges can be made at will. We show that this logic can be extended to the domain of large density contrasts, where different types of perturbative expansion are required, but that the way in which gauges can be chosen in the presence of such structures is severely constrained. In particular, most gauges that are commonly considered in the cosmology literature are found to be unviable in the presence of non-linear structures. This includes spatially flat gauge, synchronous gauge, comoving orthogonal gauge, total matter gauge, N-body gauge, and the uniform density gauge. In contrast, we find that the longitudinal gauge and the Newtonian motion gauge are both viable choices in both standard cosmological perturbation theory, and in the post-Newtonian perturbative expansions that are required in order to model non-linear structures."

However, directly measuring the lattice strain of individual catalyst nanoparticles is challenging, especially at the scale of a single unit cell. Here, we quantitatively map the strain present in rhodium@platinum (core@shell) nanocube electrocatalysts using conventional aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the recently developed technique of 4D-STEM nanobeam electron diffraction. We demonstrate that 4D-STEM combined with data pre-conditioning allows for quantitative lattice strain mapping with sub-picometer precision without the influence of scan distortions. When combined with multivariate curve resolution, 4D-STEM allows us to distinguish the nanocube core from the shell and to quantify the unit cell size as a function of distance from the core-shell interface. Our results demonstrate that 4D-STEM has significant precision and accuracy advantages in strain metrology of catalyst materials compared to aberration-corrected STEM imaging and is beneficial for extracting information about the evolution of strain in catalyst nanoparticles."

When the tumblings occur at a constant rate, we show that $S(t)$ is independent of $d$ for any finite time $t$ (and not just for large $t$), as a consequence of the celebrated Sparre Andersen theorem for discrete-time random walks in one dimension. Moreover, we show that this universal result holds for a much wider class of RTP models in which the speed $v$ of the particle after each tumbling is random, drawn from an arbitrary probability distribution. We further demonstrate, as a consequence, the universality of the record statistics in the RTP problem."

The neural network learns using the algorithms of Gradient Descent and Backpropagation. Both the implementation and training of the neural network is done locally on the robot on a raspberry pi 3 so that its learning process is completely independent. The neural network is first tested on a custom simulator developed on MATLAB and then implemented on the raspberry computer.

RE practices manifest in Requirements Information Models (RIM) that define what concepts and information should be captured for requirements. Collaboration of practitioners from different parts of an organization is required to define a suitable RIM that balances support for diverse practices in individual teams with the alignment needed for a shared view and team support on system level. There exists no guidance for this challenging task. This paper presents a mixed methods study to examine the role of RIMs in balancing alignment and diversity of RE practices in four automotive companies. Our analysis is based on data from systems engineering tools, 11 semi-structured interviews, and a survey to validate findings and suggestions. We found that balancing alignment and diversity of RE practices is important to consider when defining RIMs. We further investigated enablers for this balance and actions that practitioners take to achieve it. From these factors, we derived and evaluated recommendations for managing RIMs in practice that take into account the lifecycle of requirements and allow for diverse practices across sub-disciplines in early development, while enforcing alignment of requirements that are close to release."

The Virgo detector was also taking data that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90% credible intervals for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 $M_{\odot}$ (1.45 to 1.88 $M_{\odot}$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual binary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp mass $1.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02} M_{\odot}$ and the total mass $3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}\,M_{\odot}$ of this system are significantly larger than those of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one or both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out from gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based on its inconsistency with the known Galactic binary neutron star population. Under the assumption that the signal was produced by a binary neutron star coalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to $250-2810 \text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$."

Such a two-dimensional random-dimer model (2D-DRDM), previously introduced in [Capuzzi et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 053622 (2015)], is the disorder transition from a single square lattice, where impurities are absent, to a bipartite square lattice, where the number of impurities is maximum and coincides with half the number of lattice sites. We show that disorder correlations can play a crucial role in the dynamics for a broad range of parameters by allowing density fluctuations to propagate in the 2D-DRDM lattice, even in the limit of strong disorder. In such a regime, the propagation speed depends on the percentage of impurities, interpolating between the speed in a single monoperiodic lattice and that in a bipartite one."

This advantage, however, relies on refined data postprocessing, assessed based on the variance of the estimated parameter. When Bayesian techniques are adopted, more elements become available for assessing the quality of the estimation. Here we adopt generalized classical Cram\'er-Rao bounds for looking in detail into a phase-estimation experiment performed with quantum light. In particular, we show that the third-order absolute moment can give a superior capability in revealing biases in the estimation, compared to standard approaches. Our studies point to the identification of an alternative strategy that brings a possible advantage in monitoring the correct operation of high-precision sensors."

Parker Solar Probe's (PSP's) second solar encounter provided a new opportunity to relate in situ measurements of the nascent slow solar wind with white-light images of streamer flows. We exploit data taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) and the Wide Imager on Solar Probe to reveal for the first time a close link between imaged streamer flows and the high-density plasma measured by the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) experiment. We identify different types of slow winds measured by PSP that we relate to the spacecraft's magnetic connectivity (or not) to streamer flows. SWEAP measured high-density and highly variable plasma when PSP was well connected to streamers but more tenuous wind with much weaker density variations when it exited streamer flows. STEREO imaging of the release and propagation of small transients from the Sun to PSP reveals that the spacecraft was continually impacted by the southern edge of streamer transients. The impact of specific density structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic field reversals measured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the streamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals originating outside streamers. We tentatively interpret these findings in terms of magnetic reconnection between open magnetic fields and coronal loops with different properties, providing support for the formation of a subset of the slow wind by magnetic reconnection."

Research in these disciplines during the last decade has given rise to new, powerful concepts providing an unprecedented degree of control over light manipulation at the nanoscale. However, only recently have these concepts been used to increase the capabilities of light processing in current photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which traditionally rely only on dielectric materials with element sizes larger than the light wavelength. Amongst the different PIC platforms, silicon photonics is expected to become mainstream, since manufacturing using well-established CMOS processes enables the mass production of low-cost PICs. In this review we discuss the benefits of introducing recent concepts arisen from the fields of metamaterials, plasmonics and nanoantennas into a silicon photonics integrated platform. We review existing works in this direction and discuss how this hybrid approach can lead to the improvement of current PICs enabling novel and disruptive applications in photonics."

Observations suggest that the underlying water (liquid substrate) significantly affects the morphogenesis of leaves. To understand the biophysical mechanism under such phenomena, we develop mathematical models that can effectively account for inhomogeneous differential growth of floating and free-standing leaves, to quantitatively predict formation and evolution of their morphology. We find, both theoretically and experimentally, that the short-wavelength buckled configuration is energetically favorable for growing membranes lying on liquid, while the global buckling shape is more preferable for suspended ones. Other influencing factors such as stem/vein, heterogeneity and dimension are also investigated. Our results provide a fundamental insight into a variety of plant morphogenesis affected by water foundation and suggest that such surface instabilities can be harnessed for morphology control of biomimetic deployable structures using substrate or edge actuation."

We initially obtain a non-isothermal DEM distribution with a dominant component centered around 0.9 MK and a secondary smaller component at 1.5 - 2.0 MK. We find that deconvolving the data with the instrument point spread function (PSF) to account for long-range scattered light reduces the secondary hot component. Using the 2012 Venus transit and a 2013 lunar eclipse to test the efficiency of this deconvolution, significant amounts of residual stray light are found for the occulted areas. Accounting for this stray light in the error budget of the different AIA filters further reduces the secondary hot emission, yielding CH DEM distributions that are close to isothermal with the main contribution centered around 0.9 MK. Based on these DEMs, we analyze the evolution of the emission measure (EM), density, and averaged temperature during the CH's lifetime. We find that once the CH is clearly observed in EUV images, the bulk of the CH plasma reveals a quite constant state, i.e. temperature and density reveal no major changes, whereas the total CH area and the photospheric magnetic fine structure inside the CH show a distinct evolutionary pattern. These findings suggest that CH plasma properties are mostly ""set"" at the CH formation or/and that all CHs have similar plasma properties."

Several studies have been carried out in this field, but they generally use information in a reduced context. The majority are based solely on parameters, using traditional methods which often lead to unsatisfactory solutions.This work consists in hybridizing through genetic algorithms, economic intelligence (EI) and multicriteria analysis methods (MCA) to improve the decisions of territorial localization. The purpose is to lead the company to locate its activity in the place that would allow it a competitive advantage. This work also consists of identifying all the parameters that can influence the decision of the economic actors and equipping them with tools using all the national and international data available to lead to a mapping of countries, regions or departments favorable to the location. Throughout our research, we have as a goal the realization of a hybrid conceptual model of economic intelligence based on multicriteria on with genetic algorithms in order to optimize the decisions of localization, in this perspective we opted for the method of PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization for Method of Enrichment Evaluation), which has made it possible to obtain the best compromise between the various visions and various points of view."

This work was undertaken within the GC sub-project of the Transient UV Objects project, a programme which aims to find and study transient and strongly variable UV sources. Globular clusters are ideal targets for transient searches because of their high stellar densities and large populations of variable systems. Using all archival observations of 47 Tuc obtained with the UV/optical telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory with the uvm2 filter, we searched for UV variability using a specialised pipeline which utilises difference image analysis. We found four clear transients, hereafter SW1-4, with positions consistent with those of known cataclysmic variables (CVs) or CV candidates identified previously using Hubble Space Telescope observations. All four sources exhibit significant outbursts. Based on the inferred outburst properties and the association with known CVs, we tentatively identify the UV transients as CV-dwarf novae (DNe). Two DNe have been previously observed in 47 Tuc: V2, which has a position consistent with that of SW4; and AKO 9, which was not in outburst during any of the UVOT observations. We thus increase the known number of DNe in 47 Tuc to 5 and the total number of detected DNe in all Galactic GCs combined from 14 to 17. We discuss our results in the context of the apparent scarcity of DNe in GCs. We suggest that the likely cause is observational biases, such as limited sensitivity due to the high background from unresolved stars in the GC and limited angular resolution of the telescopes used. We additionally detected one strongly variable source in 47 Tuc, which could be identified as the known RR Lyrae star HV 810. We found its period to have significantly increased with respect to that measured from data taken in 1988."

It was demonstrated for the first time that under particular conditions it is possible to generate two-color flat-top solitonic pulses, platicons, using pump amplitude modulation or controllable mode interaction approach, if the signs of the group velocity coefficients at pump frequency and its second harmonic are opposite but absolute values of these coefficients are rather close. It was revealed that platicons may be observed on both sides of the linear microresonator resonance (at positive, as well as negative pump frequency detunings). For the efficient platicon excitation, one needs simultaneous accurate matching of both microresonator free spectral ranges and resonant eigenfrequencies. Platicon generation processes were simulated numerically, excitation conditions and platicon generation domains were found for different generation methods, and the properties of generated platicons were studied for the different combinations of the medium parameters."

We report on the search for hydrogen escape from the atmosphere K2-18 b using Lyman-$\alpha$ transit spectroscopy with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We analyzed the time-series of the fluxes of the stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of K2-18 in both its blue- and redshifted wings. We found that the average blueshifted emission of K2-18 decreases by $67\% \pm 18\%$ during the transit of the planet compared to the pre-transit emission, tentatively indicating the presence of H atoms escaping vigorously and being blown away by radiation pressure. This interpretation is not definitive because it relies on one partial transit. Based on the reconstructed Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of K2-18, we estimate an EUV irradiation between $10^1-10^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total escape rate in the order of $10^8$ g s$^{-1}$. The inferred escape rate suggests that the planet will lose only a small fraction (< 1%) of its mass and retain its volatile-rich atmosphere during its lifetime. More observations are needed to rule out stellar variability effects, confirm the in-transit absorption and better assess the atmospheric escape and high-energy environment of K2-18 b."

We obtain correlated pilots using a user capacity-achieving pilot sequence design. This design relies on an algorithm which designs correlated pilot sequences based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for all the legitimate users. The pilot design is capable of achieving the SINR requirements for all users even in the presence of PC. However, this design has some intrinsic limitations and vulnerabilities, such as a known pilot sequence and the non-zero cross-correlation among different pilot sequences. We reveal that such vulnerabilities may be exploited by an active attacker to increase PC in the network. Motivated by this, we analyze the correlated pilot design for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an active attacker. Based on this analysis, we develop an effective active attack strategy in the massive MIMO network with correlated pilot sequences. Our examinations reveal that the user capacity region of the network is significantly reduced in the presence of the active attack. Importantly, the SINR requirements for the worst-affected users may not be satisfied even with an infinite number of antennas at the base station."

Based on first-principles calculations, we show that significant spin splitting can be induced in the ML 1T-TMDCs by introducing the line defect. Taking the ML PtSe2 as a representative example, we considered the most stable form of the line defects, namely Se-vacancy line defect (Se-VLD). We find that large spin splitting is observed in the defect states of the Se-VLD, exhibiting a highly unidirectional spin configuration in the momentum space. This peculiar spin configuration may yield the so-called persistent spin textures (PST), a specific spin structure resulting in protection against spin-decoherence and supporting an extraordinarily long spin lifetime. Moreover, by using k.p perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry analysis, we clarified that the emerging of the spin splitting maintaining the PST in the defect states is originated from the inversion symmetry breaking together with one-dimensional nature of the Se-VLD engineered ML PtSe2. Our findings pave a possible way to induce the significant spin splitting in the ML 1T-TMDCs, which could be highly important for designing spintronic devices."

Pronounced influence of the inter-island coupling strength was found on the frequency response of the samples. Through the subsequent analysis of the frequency- and coupling-dependent freezing temperatures, we discuss the phenomenological parameters obtained in the framework of Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law in terms of the samples microscopic features. The high sensitivity and robust signal to noise ratio of AC susceptibility validates the latter as a promising and simple experimental technique for resolving the dynamics and temperature driven dynamics crossovers for the case of artificial spin ice."

Quantum dots have a reversible, stochastic transition between luminescent and non-luminescent states. The luminescence intermittency is known as blinking, and is not evident from ensemble measurements. In order to stimulate critical thinking, students design, perform, and analyze a semiconductor quantum dot blinking laboratory experiment. The design of the experiment and stochastic nature of the data collected require students to make judgements throughout the course of the single-particle measurement and analysis. Some of the decisions do not have uniquely correct answers, challenging the students to engage in critical thinking. We propose that students' self-examined decision making develops a constructivist view of science. The experiment is visually striking, interdisciplinary, and develops higher order thinking."

Because of wide openness, relatively high processing power, and wide distribution of IoT things, they are ideal for attacks of the gray hole. In the gray hole attack, the attacker fakes itself as the shortest path to the destination that is a thing here. This causes the routing packets not to reach the destination. The proposed method is based on the AODV routing protocol and is presented under the MTISS-IoT name which means for the reduction of gray hole attacks using check node information. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on cryptographic authentication. The proposed approach consists of four phases, such as the verifying node trust in the IoT, testing the routes, gray hole attack discovery, and the malicious attack elimination process in MTISS-IoT. The method is evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in the NS-3 environment. The experimental results of four scenarios demonstrated that the MTISS-IoT method can achieve a false positive rate of 14.104%, a false negative rate of 17.49%, and a detection rate of 94.5% when gray hole attack was launched."

Spin-polarized resonance states evolving between the foremost atom of a magnetic probe tip and the opposed magnetic surface atom are found to provide a loophole from the hitherto existing dilemma of losing spatial resolution when increasing the tip-sample distance in a scanning probe setup. Bias-dependent series of SP-STM images recorded via resonant tunneling reveal spin sensitivity at resonance conditions, indicating that the spin-polarized resonance states act as mediators for the spin contrast across the nm-spaced vacuum gap. With technically feasible distances in the nm regime, resonant tunneling in SP-STM qualifies for a spin-sensitive read-write technique with ultimate lateral resolution in future spintronic applications."

We adopt a flexible skew-normal DTD model, which could match a wide range of physically motivated DTD forms. We find a family of solutions that are essentially exponential DTDs, similar in shape to the $\beta\approx-1$ power-law DTDs, but with more delayed events (>1 Gyr in age) than prompt events (<1 Gyr). Comparing these solutions to delay time measures separately derived from field galaxies and galaxy clusters, we find the skew-normal solutions can accommodate both without requiring a different DTD form in different environments. These model fits are generally inconsistent with results from single-degenerate binary population synthesis models, and are seemingly supportive of double-degenerate progenitors for most SN Ia events."

In this book a story is told about the psychological traits associated with drug consumption. The book includes:   - A review of published works on the psychological profiles of drug users.   - Analysis of a new original database with information on 1885 respondents and usage of 18 drugs. (Database is available online.)   - An introductory description of the data mining and machine learning methods used for the analysis of this dataset.   - The demonstration that the personality traits (five factor model, impulsivity, and sensation seeking), together with simple demographic data, give the possibility of predicting the risk of consumption of individual drugs with sensitivity and specificity above 70% for most drugs.   - The analysis of correlations of use of different substances and the description of the groups of drugs with correlated use (correlation pleiades).   - Proof of significant differences of personality profiles for users of different drugs. This is explicitly proved for benzodiazepines, ecstasy, and heroin.   - Tables of personality profiles for users and non-users of 18 substances.   The book is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of machine learning, advanced data mining concepts or modern psychology of personality is assumed. For more detailed introduction into statistical methods we recommend several undergraduate textbooks. Familiarity with basic statistics and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful as well as some basic technical understanding of psychology."

The effective theory of a massive spin-2 particle coupled to matter particles is constructed directly at the amplitude level. In this setting we calculate the gravitational Compton scattering amplitudes and study their UV properties. While the Compton amplitudes generically grow with energy as $\mathcal{O}(E^6)$, we identify regions of the parameter space where they are softened to $\mathcal{O}(E^4)$ or even $\mathcal{O}(E^3)$, which allows for a larger validity range of the effective theory. In these regions, both positivity and beyond-positivity of the forward Compton amplitudes are fulfilled, and the equivalence principle automatically emerges."

We demonstrate that the focal surface curvature varies significantly with a change of the object position and that it can easily be computed with the Seidel aberration theory. Using this analytically derived curvature value as the starting point, we optimise a refocusable projection system with 90 degrees field of view and F/#=6.2 . It is demonstrated that such a system can provide stable image quality and illumination when refocusing from infinity to 1.5 m. The gain in spatial resolution is as high as 1.54 times with respect to a flat focal surface. Furthermore, we prove that a silicon die can be curved to the required shape with a safety factor of 4.3 in terms of the mechanical stress. Finally, it is shown that the developed system can be used in a virtual reality headset providing high resolution, low distortion and a flexible focusing mode."

In the absence of propagation effects, this ""photon ring"" has universal features that are completely governed by general relativity and independent of the details of the emission. Here, we show that the polarimetric image of a black hole also displays universal properties. In particular, the photon ring exhibits a self-similar pattern of polarization that encodes the black hole spin. We explore the corresponding universal polarimetric signatures of the photon ring on long interferometric baselines, and propose a method for measuring the black hole spin using a sparse interferometric array. These signatures could enable spin measurements of the supermassive black hole in M87, as well as precision tests of general relativity in the strong field regime, via a future extension of the Event Horizon Telescope to space."

Particularly in systems whose dynamics are determined by a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function. For hybrid systems which possess a continuous-time dynamics determined by a Lagrangian function, with a cyclic variable, the degrees of freedom for the corresponding hybrid Lagrangian system can be reduced by means of a method known as \textit{hybrid Routhian reduction}. In this paper we study sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic orbits in hybrid Routhian systems which also exhibit time-reversal symmetry. Likewise, we explore some stability aspects of such orbits through the characterization of the eigenvalues for the corresponding linearized Poincar\'e map. Finally, we apply the results to find periodic solutions in underactuated hybrid Routhian control systems."

After annotating conversational text through crowdsourcing, we trained NLP tools to detect the presence of these types of interaction from conversations, and applied them to 160M messages written by geo-referenced Reddit users, 290k emails from the Enron corpus and 300k lines of dialogue from movie scripts. We show that social dimensions can be predicted purely from conversations with an AUC up to 0.98, and that the combination of the predicted dimensions suggests both the types of relationships people entertain (conflict vs. support) and the types of real-world communities (wealthy vs. deprived) they shape."

Our work focuses on an efficient distributed-memory parallelization of an accurate single-node algorithm for overlapping and aligning long reads. We achieve scalability of this irregular algorithm by addressing the competing issues of increasing parallelism, minimizing communication, constraining the memory footprint, and ensuring good load balance. The resulting application, diBELLA, is the first distributed memory overlapper and aligner specifically designed for long reads and parallel scalability.

In quantum optics, the generation of photon pairs with a counter-propagating parametric down-conversion process (PDC) in a waveguide, where signal and idler photons propagate in opposite directions, offers unique material-independent engineering capabilities. However, realizing counter-propagating PDC necessitates quasi-phase-matching (QPM) with extremely short poling periods. Here, we report on the generation of counter-propagating single-photon pairs in a self-made periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a poling period on the same order of magnitude as the generated wavelength. The single photons of the biphoton state bridge GHz and THz bandwidths with a separable joint temporal-spectral behavior.

The inclusion of both levels creates a more general predictive model, allowing for more meaningful prediction and reasoning about pedestrian trajectories, as compared to the current state of the art. The model uses an iterative clustering algorithm with (1) Dirichlet Process Gaussian Processes to cluster trajectories into continuous motion patterns and (2) hypothesis testing to identify discrete transitions in the data called transition points. The model iteratively splits full trajectories into sub-trajectory clusters based on transition points, where pedestrians make discrete decisions. State transition probabilities are then learned over the transition points and trajectory clusters. The model is for online prediction of motions, and detection of anomalous trajectories. The proposed model is validated on the Duke MTMC dataset to demonstrate identification of low level trajectory clusters and high level transitions, and the ability to predict pedestrian motion and detect anomalies online with high accuracy."

Of these, 39 objects are identified as CVs, from which 8 targets show observational characteristics of mCVs, being 7 polars and 1 intermediate polar. The remaining 31 CVs in our sample are probably non-magnetic systems, in low (22 systems) or high (9 systems) accretion states. Six targets of the sample are not CVs (5 AGNs and 1 T Tauri star). Among the 8 objects with mCV spectra, 6 are new classifications. Three polars were observed in low accretion state, either revealing photospheric features of the secondary star and allowing the estimation of their spectral type, or presenting H$\beta$ Zeeman components associated to the WD magnetic field. In addition to the results obtained in the first paper of the series, and depending on the confirmation of these classifications by observational follow-up, our results would increase the sample of known polars by about 9 percent."

We aim to detect the radial velocity (RV) signal imposed by Kepler-1625b (and its putative moon) on the host star or, as the case may be, determine an upper limit on the mass of the transiting object. We took a total of 22 spectra of Kepler-1625 using CARMENES, 20 of which were useful. Observations were spread over a total of seven nights between October 2017 and October 2018, covering $125\%$ of one full orbit of Kepler-1625b. We used the automatic Spectral Radial Velocity Analyser (SERVAL) pipeline to deduce the stellar RVs and uncertainties. Then we fitted the RV curve model of a single planet on a Keplerian orbit to the observed RVs using a $\chi^2$ minimisation procedure. We derive upper limits on the mass of Kepler-1625b under the assumption of a single planet on a circular orbit. In this scenario, the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$, and $3\,\sigma$ confidence upper limits for the mass of Kepler-1625b are $2.90\,M_{\rm J}$, $7.15\,M_{\rm J}$, and $11.60\,M_{\rm J}$, respectively. We present strong evidence for the planetary nature of Kepler-1625b, making it the 10th most long-period confirmed planet known today. Our data does not answer the question about a second, possibly more short-period planet that could be responsible for the observed transit timing variation of Kepler-1625b."

Such black hole exoplanets are heated by strongly blueshifted and focused flux of the incoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and cooled by the cold part of the local sky containing the black hole shadow. This gives rise to a temperature difference, which can drive processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium in a hypothetical life form inhabiting black hole exoplanets, similar to the case of a planet heated by the radiation of the parent star and cooled by the night sky. We found that for a narrow range of radii of very low Keplerian circular orbits and for very high spin of a supermassive black hole, the temperature regime of the black hole exoplanets corresponds to the habitable zone around standard stars. The thermodynamics of black hole exoplanets therefore, in principle, does not exclude the existence of life based on known biology. The peak of the multiblackbody spectral profile of the CMB heating the exoplanet is located in the ultraviolet band, but a significant fraction of the flux comes also in the visible and infrared bands. The minimum mass of a black hole ensuring the resistance to tidal disruption of an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone is estimated to $1.63 \cdot 10^8 \, m_{\odot}$."

Their transfer in gas being a complex process, the interpretation of their observational signatures, either in absorption or in emission, is often not straightforward. Numerical radiative transfer simulations are needed to accurately describe the travel of resonant line photons in real and in frequency space, and to produce realistic mock observations. This paper introduces RASCAS, a new public 3D radiative transfer code developed to perform the propagation of any resonant line in numerical simulations of astrophysical objects. RASCAS was designed to be easily customisable and to process simulations of arbitrarily large sizes on large supercomputers. RASCAS performs radiative transfer on an adaptive mesh with an octree structure using the Monte Carlo technique. RASCAS features full MPI parallelisation, domain decomposition, adaptive load-balancing, and a standard peeling algorithm to construct mock observations. The radiative transport of resonant line photons through different mixes of species (e.g. \ion{H}{i}, \ion{Si}{ii}, \ion{Mg}{ii}, \ion{Fe}{ii}), including their interaction with dust, is implemented in a modular fashion to allow new transitions to be easily added to the code. RASCAS is very accurate and efficient. It shows perfect scaling up to a minimum of a thousand cores. It has been fully tested against radiative transfer problems with analytic solutions and against various test cases proposed in the literature. Although it was designed to describe accurately the many scatterings of line photons, RASCAS may also be used to propagate photons at any wavelength (e.g. stellar continuum or fluorescent lines), or to cast millions of rays to integrate the optical depths of ionising photons, making it highly versatile."

The OTELO survey aims to provide the deepest narrow-band survey to date in terms of minimum detectable flux and emission line equivalent width in order to detect the faintest extragalactic emission line systems. In this way, OTELO data will complements other broad-band, narrow-band, and spectroscopic surveys. The red tunable filter of the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) is used to scan a spectral window centred at $9175 \AA$, which is free from strong sky emission lines, with a sampling interval of $6 \AA$ and a bandwidth of $12 \AA$ in the most deeply explored Extended Groth Strip region. Careful data reduction using improved techniques for sky ring subtraction, accurate astrometry, photometric calibration, and source extraction enables us to compile the OTELO catalogue. This catalogue is complemented with ancillary data ranging from deep X-ray to far-infrared, including high resolution HST images, which allow us to segregate the different types of targets, derive precise photometric redshifts, and obtain the morphological classification of the extragalactic objects detected. The OTELO multi-wavelength catalogue contains 11237 entries and is 50\% complete at AB magnitude 26.38. Of these sources, 6600 have photometric redshifts with an uncertainty $z_{phot}$ better than $0.2 (1+z_{phot})$.

A possible nova-impostor,"Some transients, although classified as novae based on their maximum and early decline optical spectra, cast doubts on their true nature and whether nova impostors might exist. We monitored a candidate nova which displayed a distinctly unusual light curve at maximum and early decline through optical spectroscopy (3000-10000 \AA, 500<R<100000) complemented with Swift UV and AAVSO optical photometry. We use the spectral line series to characterize the ejecta dynamics, structure, and mass. We found that the ejecta are in free ballistic expansion and structured as typical of classical novae. However, their derived mass is at least an order of magnitude larger than the typical ejecta masses obtained for classical novae. Specifically, we found M$_{ej}\simeq$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ independent of the distance for a filling factor $\varepsilon$=1. By constraining the distance we derived $\varepsilon$ in the range 0.08-0.10, giving a mass 7$\times$10$^{-4}\lesssim$ M$_{ej}\lesssim$9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$. The nebular spectrum, characterized by unusually strong coronal emission lines, confines the ionizing source energy to the range 20-250 eV, possibly peaking in the range 75-100 or 75-150 eV. We link this source to other slow novae which showed similar behavior and suggest that they might form a distinct physical sub-group. They may result from a classical nova explosion occurring on a very low mass white dwarf or be impostors for an entirely different type of transient."

We use these measurements to create two $\delta$CN indices finding that both distributions are best fit by two populations, a CN-enhanced and CN-normal. We find that 42 $\pm$ 4\% of the RGB stars in our sample are CN-enhanced. The percentage of CN-enhanced is 40 $\pm$ 13\% for the AGB and 33 $\pm$ 9\% for the HB stars, which suggests there are no missing second generation stars at these stages of stellar evolution. The two generations also separate in magnitude and color on the HB, which allows us to find the difference in He abundance between the two populations by fitting appropriate ZAHBs. The broad range of distances from the cluster's center covered by our sample allows us to study the dependence of the ratio of the number of first to second population stars on the distance from the cluster's center, and we find that this ratio does not vary radially and that the two populations are spatially mixed. Finally, we compare our identification of multiple populations with the classification based on the Na-O anti-correlation and the HST UV photometry, and we find good agreement with both methods."

Manned aerial surveys are an essential element of the planned consequence management operation, as demonstrated by the recovery work following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and their effects in Fukushima, Japan. Flying lower and slower than manned aircraft, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can provide improved spatial resolution. In particular, hot spot activity can be underestimated in manned survey results as the higher flight altitude and wider line spacing effectively average the hot spot over a larger area. Moreover, a UAV can enter an area which is hazardous for humans. NRCan has been investigating the inclusion of UAV-borne radiation survey spectrometers into its aerial survey response procedures. The Advanced Radiation Detector for UAV Operations (ARDUO) was developed to exploit the flight and lift capabilities available in the under 25kg class of UAVs. The detector features eight 2.8cm x 2.8cm x 5.6cm CsI(Tl) crystals in a self-shielding configuration, read out with silicon photomultipliers and digitized using miniaturized custom electronics. The ARDUO is flown on a main- and tail-rotor UAV called Responder which has a 6kg lift capacity and up to 40min. endurance. The performance of the ARDUO-Responder UAV system was characterized in both lab and outdoor trials. Outdoor trials consisted of aerial surveys over sealed point sources and over a distributed source. Results show how the directional response of the ARDUO can provide an indication in real time of source location for in-flight guidance. As well, the results show how use of the directional information in post-acquisition processing can result in improved spatial resolution of radiation features for both point and distributed sources."

To investigate reactions in such systems, we develop a fast and robust method ---viz., local manifold analysis (LMA)--- for computing the instantaneous decay rate of reactants. Specifically, it computes the instantaneous decay rates along saddle-bound trajectories near the activated complex by exploiting local properties of the stable and unstable manifold associated with the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM). The LMA method offers substantial reduction of numerical effort and increased reliability in comparison to direct ensemble integration. It provides an instantaneous flux that can be assigned to every point on the NHIM and which is associated with a trajectory ---regardless of whether it is periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic--- that is bound on the NHIM. The time average of these fluxes in the driven system corresponds to the average rate through a given local section containing the corresponding point on the NHIM. We find good agreement between the results of the LMA and direct ensemble integration obtained using numerically constructed, recrossing-free dividing surfaces."

By a simple choice of the pseudo-unitary representation of the underlying symmetry group, motivated from the perspective of the Minkowski spacetime as a representation for the Lorentz group, we obtain the natural non-unitary Fock space picture commonly considered though not formulated and presented in the careful details given here. From a direct derivation of the appropriate basis state wavefunctions of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz symmetry, the relation between the latter and the Fock state wavefunctions is also explicitly shown. Moreover, the full picture including the states with non-positive norm may give consistent physics picture as a version of Lorentz covariant quantum mechanics. Probability interpretation for the usual von Neumann measurements is not a problem as all wavefunctions restricted to a definite value for the `time' variable are just like those of the usual time independent quantum mechanics. A further understanding from a perspective of the dynamics from the symplectic geometry of the phase space is shortly discussed."

The initial eigenstates of the system are found by exact diagonalization of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We drive transitions between the eigenstates by inducing a weak modulation of the tunnelling rate and show that a single atom can be extracted while the remaining atoms stay localized despite the persistent external modulation. This scheme suggests the experimental realization of small matter-wave solitons with deterministic number of atoms. In addition, the knowledge of exact eigenstates allows identification of the selection rules for transitions between the different eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. One selection rule is related to the translation symmetry of the system. Another one is strictly applicable only on a subspace of the total Hilbert space and is related to the parity symmetry. We show that in the strongly interacting limit this selection rule has implications on the entire Hilbert space. We discuss its signatures on the system's dynamics and consider how it can be observed experimentally with ultracold atoms."

We identify the properties of the effective potential of the scalar field that leads to this behavior and characterize it in detail. If the scalar field is non-minimally coupled, considered here, the scalar quasinormal modes will leak into the gravitational wave signal and will have decaying times that are comparable or smaller than those typical in General Relativity. Hence, these modes could be detectable in the future. Finally, we find that the anomalous behavior in the decay timescales of quasinormal modes is present in a much larger class of models beyond a simple massive scalar field."

As the fluid navigates the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses build up, causing the flow to become unstable at sufficiently large injection rates. However, it is poorly understood how the spatial and temporal characteristics of this unstable flow depend on pore space geometry. We elucidate this dependence by systematically varying the spacing between pore constrictions in a model porous medium. We find that when the pore spacing is large, unstable eddies form upstream of each pore, similar to observations of an isolated pore. By contrast, when the pore spacing is sufficiently small, the flow exhibits a surprising bistability, stochastically switching between two distinct unstable flow states. We hypothesize that this unusual behavior arises from the interplay between flow-induced polymer elongation and relaxation of polymers as they are advected through the porous medium. Consistent with this idea, we find that the flow state in a given pore persists for long times. Moreover, we find that the flow state is correlated between neighboring pores; however, these correlations do not persist long-range. Our results thus help to elucidate the rich array of flow behaviors that can arise in polymer solution flow through porous media."

We welcome this particular side of their communication as it helps stimulating the effort towards the adoption of better statistical methods in galaxy rotation curves, an effort to which we contributed with Rodrigues {\it et al.}~2018 (hereafter R18). Indeed, R18 was the first work that, in order to conclude on the universality of the acceleration scale $a_0$, studied the posterior distributions on $a_0$ of a large set of galaxies. As C19 agrees, the credible intervals were found within the Bayesian framework, that is, the marginalized posteriors on $a_0$ were found using Bayes' theorem to update the priors in light of the observational data; this process was done without introducing any approximation. Considering R18, C19 also remarks that: i) better methods to select the nuisance parameters and the corresponding priors could be used; ii) a quality cut based on $\chi^2$ values should not be used, and iii) the compatibility of the posteriors should be assessed in a more robust way. In the following, after first clarifying the context of our work, we address these criticisms."

Firstly, the main topological characteristics, such as the POC, degree of freedom and coupling degree were calculated for kinematic modeling. Thanks to these properties, the direct and inverse kinematic problems can be readily solved. Further, the conditions of the singular configurations of the PM were analyzed which corresponds to its partial motion decoupling property."

For instance, charge- and heat transport depend on low-frequency phonons, while for other properties, such as the free energy, especially high-frequency phonons count. For all these quantities one needs to know the entire phonon band structure, whose simulation becomes exceedingly expensive for more complex systems when using methods like dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). Therefore, in the present contribution we evaluate the performance of more approximate methodologies, including density functional tight binding (DFTB) and a pool of force fields (FF) of varying complexity and sophistication. Beyond merely comparing phonon band structures, we also critically evaluate to what extent derived quantities, like temperature-dependent heat capacities, mean squared thermal displacements and temperature-dependent free energies are impacted by shortcomings in the description of the phonon bands. As a benchmark system, we choose (deuterated) naphthalene, as the only organic semiconductor material for which to date experimental phonon band structures are available in the literature. Overall, the best performance amongst the approximate methodologies is observed for a system-specifically parametrized second-generation force field. Interestingly, in the low-frequency regime also force fields with a rather simplistic model for the bonding interactions (like the General Amber Force Field) perform rather well. As far as the tested DFTB parametrization is concerned, we obtain a significant underestimation of the unit cell volume resulting in a pronounced overestimation of the phonon energies in the low frequency region. This cannot be mended by relying on the DFT-calculated unit cell, since with this unit cell the DFTB phonon frequencies significantly underestimate the experiments."

One is called the duplex Mikaelian lens, which is made by splicing two half Mikaelian lenses with different periods. The other is exponential conformal transformer of duplex Mikaelian lens with the ratio of different periods of its two half Mikaelian lenses a rational number, which we call duplex Maxwell's fish eye lens. Duplex Mikaelian lenses have continuous translation symmetry with arbitrary real number, while duplex Maxwell's fish eye lenses have continuous rotational symmetry from 0 to 2*Pi. Hence each duplex Maxwell's fish eye lens corresponds to a duplex Mikaelian lens. We further demonstrate the caustic effect of geometric optics in duplex Mikaelian lenses and duplex Maxwell's fish eye lenses. In addition, we investigate the Talbot effect of wave optics in the duplex Mikaelian lens based on numeric calculations. Our findings based on splicing and exponential conformal mapping enlarge the family of absolute optical instruments."

This is the highest flux state for Mrk 421 ever observed in VHE $\gamma$-rays. Data are analyzed from a coordinated campaign across multiple instruments including VHE $\gamma$-ray (VERITAS, MAGIC), high-energy (HE) $\gamma$-ray (Fermi-LAT), X-ray (Swift}, RXTE, MAXI), optical (including the GASP-WEBT collaboration and polarization data) and radio (Mets\""ahovi, OVRO, UMRAO). Light curves are produced spanning multiple days before and after the peak of the VHE flare, including over several flare `decline' epochs. The main flare statistics allow 2-minute time bins to be constructed in both the VHE and optical bands enabling a cross-correlation analysis that shows evidence for an optical lag of $\sim$25-55 minutes, the first time-lagged correlation between these bands reported on such short timescales. Limits on the Doppler factor ($\delta \gtrsim 33$) and the size of the emission region ($ \delta^{-1}R_B \lesssim 3.8\times 10^{13}\,\,\mbox{cm}$) are obtained from the fast variability observed by VERITAS during the main flare. Analysis of 10-minute-binned VHE and X-ray data over the decline epochs shows an extraordinary range of behavior in the flux-flux relationship: from linear to quadratic to lack of correlation to anti-correlation. Taken together, these detailed observations of an unprecedented flare seen in Mrk 421 are difficult to explain by the classic single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model."

The non-Riemannian volume element in the initial scalar field action leads to a hidden nonlinear Noether symmetry which produces energy-momentum tensor identified as a sum of a dynamically generated cosmological constant and a dust-like dark matter. The non-Riemannian volume-element in the initial Einstein-Hilbert action upon passage to the physical Einstein-frame creates dynamically a second scalar field with a non-trivial inflationary potential and with an additional interaction with the dynamically generated dark matter. The resulting Einstein-frame action describes a fully dynamically generated inflationary model coupled to dark matter. Numerical results for observables such as the scalar power spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio conform to the latest 2018 PLANCK data."

The presented method is based on the Theory of Functional Connections, and is solved in two steps. First, the Theory of Functional Connections analytically embeds the differential equation constraints into a candidate function (called a $constrained \, expression$) that contains a function that the user is free to choose. This expression always satisfies the constraints, no matter what the free function is. Second, the free-function is expanded as a linear combination of orthogonal basis functions with unknown coefficients. The constrained expression (and its derivatives) are then substituted into the eighth-order differential equation, transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem where the coefficients in the linear combination of orthogonal basis functions are the optimization parameters. These parameters are then found by linear/nonlinear least-squares. The solution obtained from this method is a highly accurate analytical approximation of the true solution. Comparisons with alternative methods appearing in literature validate the proposed approach."

The $\mathit{B}$ band light curve comparison of SN 2010kd with a subset of well-studied SLSNe I at comparable redshifts indicates that it is a slow-decaying PTF12dam like SLSN. Analytical light-curve modeling using the $\mathtt{Minim}$ code suggests that the bolometric light curve of SN 2010kd favors circumstellar matter interaction for the powering mechanism. $\mathtt{SYNAPPS}$ modeling of the early-phase spectra does not identify broad H or He lines, whereas the photospheric-phase spectra are dominated by O I, O II, C II, C IV and Si II, particularly, presence of both low and high-velocity components of O II and Si II lines. The nebular-phase spectra of SN 2010kd are dominated by O I and Ca II emission lines similar to those seen in other SLSNe I. The line velocities in SN 2010kd exhibit flatter evolution curves similar to SN 2015bn but with comparatively higher values. SN 2010kd shows a higher single-zone local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature in comparison to PTF12dam and SN 2015bn, and it has an upper O I ejected mass limit of $\sim 10~M_\odot$. The host of SN 2010kd is a dwarf galaxy with a high star-formation rate ($\sim 0.18 \pm 0.04~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) and extreme emission lines."

First, by means of advanced experimental imaging techniques, we deduce how flower defects are formed during recrystallization of chemical vapor deposited graphene. We propose that the flower defects arise from a bulge type mechanism in which the flower domains are the grains left over by dynamic recrystallisation. Next, in order to evaluate the use of such defects as possible building blocks for all-graphene electronics, we combine multiscale modeling tools to investigate the structure and the electron and phonon transport properties of large monolayer graphene samples with a random distribution of flower defects. For large enough flower densities, we find that electron transport is strongly suppressed while, surprisingly, hole transport remains almost unaffected. These results suggest possible applications of flowered graphene for electron energy filtering. For the same defect densities, phonon transport is reduced by orders of magnitude as elastic scattering by defects becomes dominant. Heat transport by flexural phonons, key in graphene, is largely suppressed even for very low concentrations."

Searches for gravitational wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherentWave-Burst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors."

Focusing on the population of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 0.4$, we also aim to study the environments of AGN and non-AGN galaxies at that redshift. We make use of the multiwavelength catalog of objects in the field compiled by the OTELO survey, unique in terms of minimum line flux and equivalent width. The OTELO pseudo-spectra allow the identification of emission lines and the spectral classification of the sources. We obtained a sample of 72 AGNs in the field of OTELO, selected with four different methods in the optical, X-rays, and mid-infrared bands. We find that using X-rays is the most efficient way to select AGNs. An analysis was performed on the AGN population of OTELO in order to characterize its members. At $z \sim 0.4$, we find that up to 26\% of our H$\alpha$ emitters are AGNs. At that redshift, AGNs are found in identical environments to non-AGNs, although they represent the most clustered group when compared to passive and star-forming galaxies. The majority of our AGNs at any redshift were classified as late-type galaxies, including a 16\% proportion of irregulars. Another 16\% of AGNs show signs of interactions or mergers. Regarding the infrared luminosity, we are able to recover all the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the field of OTELO up to $z\sim 1.6$.

Moreover, these systems typically require the use of expensive optical and mechanical components hampering their applicability in research groups with low budget.

It is shown numerically that in various scaling regimes the Whitham equation gives a more accurate approximation of the free-surface problem for the Euler system than other models like the KdV, and Kawahara equation.

However, some classes of design tasks involve criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual design tasks seeking to fulfill aesthetic goals are difficult to handle purely with computers. One promising approach is to leverage human computation; that is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a working system.   In this chapter, we discuss such computational design with crowds in the domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects. Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by leveraging human computation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of computational design with crowds with two illustrative examples: (1) estimating the objective function (specifically, preference learning from crowds' pairwise comparisons) to facilitate interactive design exploration by a designer and (2) directly searching for the optimal parameter setting that maximizes the objective function (specifically, crowds-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization)."

QPEs are rapid and recurrent increases of the X-ray count-rate by more than one order of magnitude with respect to a stable quiescent level. During a XMM-Newton observation lasting 48 ks that was performed on 30 and 31 May 2019, three strong QPEs lasting about half an hour each were detected in the light curves of RX J1301.9+2747. The first two QPEs are separated by a longer recurrence time (about 20 ks) compared to the second and third (about 13 ks). This pattern is consistent with the alternating long-short recurrence times of the GSN 069 QPEs, although the difference between the consecutive recurrence times is significantly smaller in GSN 069. Longer X-ray observations will better clarify the temporal pattern of the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 and will allow a detailed comparison with GSN 069 to be performed. The X-ray spectral properties of QPEs in the two sources are remarkably similar, with QPEs representing fast transitions from a relatively cold and likely disk-dominated state to a state that is characterized by a warmer emission similar to the so-called soft X-ray excess, a component that is almost ubiquitously seen in the X-ray spectra of unobscured, radiatively efficient active galaxies. Previous X-ray observations of RX J1301.9+2747 in 2000 and 2009 strongly suggest that QPEs have been present for at least the past 18.5 years. The detection of QPEs from a second galactic nucleus after GSN 069 rules out contamination by a Galactic source in both cases, such that QPEs ought to be considered a novel extragalactic phenomenon associated with accreting supermassive black holes."

We used MCMC-based Bayesian inferences to estimate 100 groups of red noise synthesized randomly for evaluating its accuracy. At the same time, the Brooks-Gelman algorithm was employed to precisely diagnose the convergence of the Markov chains generated by MCMC. The root-mean-square error of parameter inferences to the synthetic data is only 1.14. Furthermore, we applied the algorithm to analyze the oscillation modes in a sunspot and a flare. A 70 s period is detected in the sunspot umbra in addition to 3- and 5-minute periods, and a 40 s period is detected in the flare. The results prove that estimating red noise with MCMC-based Bayesian has more high accuracy in the case of proper priors and convergence. We also find that the number of iterations increases dramatically to achieve convergence as the number of parameters grows. Therefore, we strongly recommend that when estimating red noise with MCMC-based Bayesian, different initial values must be selected to ensure that the entire posterior distribution is covered."

The intrinsic contribution of the anomalous Hall conductance sigma_AH^int was approximately 613 {\Omega}-1 cm-1, which was more than 3 times the maximum value in the frustrated kagome magnet Fe3Sn2 and nearly independent of the temperature over a wide range between 5 and 350 K. The analysis results revealed that the large AHE was dominated by a common, intrinsic term, while the extrinsic contribution, i.e., the skew scattering and side jump, turned out to be small. In addition to the large AHE, it was found the types of majority carriers changed at approximately 275 and 30 K, consistent with the critical temperatures of the spin reorientation. These findings suggest that the hexagonal ferromagnetic Fe5Sn3 single crystal is an excellent candidate to use for the study of the topological features in ferromagnets."

Optomechanical systems are shown to have the potential to go beyond these limits. We present an approach using optomechanics to extend the concept of the traditional CEP in the few-cycle regime to mechanical pulses and develop a two-step model to give a physical insight. By adding an auxiliary continuous optical field, we show that a CEP-dependent effect appears even in the multi-cycle regime of mechanical pulses. We obtain the approximated analytical solutions providing full understanding for these optomechanically induced CEP-dependent effects. In addition, our findings show that one can draw on the optomechanical interaction to revive the CEP-dependent effects on optical pulses with an arbitrary number of cycles and without specific intensity requirements. The effects of CEP, broadly extended to encompass few- and multi-cycle optical and mechanical pulses, may stimulate a variety of applications in the preparation of a CEP-stabilized pulse, the generation of ultrasonic pulses with a desired shape, the linear manipulation of optical combs, and more."

CO, CS, CN, and H2CO around DG Tau B","The chemical composition of planets is inherited by the distribution of the various molecular species in the protoplanetary disk at thetime of their formation. As of today, only a handful of disks has been imaged in multiple spectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign devoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we report on new ALMA Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the embedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum emission reveals a dust disk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as the prominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they remain undetected in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side outflow, we inferred that the disk emission is optically thick in the inner 50 au. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from this inner region and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and the characterization of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from the inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar. The CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is observed only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with previous observations and the predictions of thermochemical disk models. Finally, we constrained the disk-integrated column density of all molecules. In particular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller than 2, making the methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio available from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya)."

OLSR protocol is one of the routing protocols in mobile ad hoc network that selects the shortest route between source and destination through Dijkstra's algorithm. However, OLSR suffers from a major problem. It does not consider parameters such as nodes energy level and links length in its route processing. This paper employs the artificial immune system (AIS) to enhance efficiency of OLSR routing protocol. The proposed algorithm, called AIS-OLSR, considers hop count, remaining energy in the intermediate nodes, and distance among node, which is realized by negative selection and ClonalG algorithms of AIS. Widespread packet - level simulation in ns-2 environment, shows that AIS-OLSR outperforms OLSR and EA-OLSR in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, end-end delay and lifetime."

Qubits are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of two entangled photons generated by parametric down-conversion (PDC) while the environment is implemented using their spatial degrees of freedom. The ability to manipulate with high accuracy the number of correlated pixels of a spatial-light-modulator and the spectral PDC width, allows us to control the transition from a scenario where the qubits are embedded in local environments to the situation where they are subject to the same global noise. We witness the transition by monitoring the decoherence of the two-qubit state."

However, the latest high-precision measurements of these masses carried out at different mass spectrometers indicate an inconsistency of five standard deviations. To determine the masses of the lightest ions with a relative precision of a few parts per trillion and investigate this mass problem a cryogenic multi-Penning trap setup, LIONTRAP (Light ION TRAP), was constructed. This allows an independent and more precise determination of the relevant atomic masses by measuring the cyclotron frequency of single trapped ions in comparison to that of a single carbon ion. In this paper the measurement concept and the first doubly compensated cylindrical electrode Penning trap, are presented. Moreover, the analysis of the first measurement campaigns of the proton's and oxygen's atomic mass is described in detail, resulting in mp = 1.007 276 466 598 (33) u and m(16O)= 15.994 914 619 37 (87) u. The results on these data sets have already been presented in [F. Heisse et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 033001 (2017)].

However, it is increasingly challenging to track important statistics concerning this sparse, geographically dispersed population, resulting in a lack of reliable, up-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook Advertising platform, which offers a digital ""census"" of over two billions of its users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy, a country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we show that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from instability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated municipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative methodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the coverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible fine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we evaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in terms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to Facebook-specific user ""interests"" and behaviors, we provide further insights on the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in gambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural areas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to consider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The findings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and methodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic studies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations, conclusions, and most importantly, policies."

When comments are ranked by an ordered score (e.g. number of replies or up-votes) without adjusting for semantic similarity of near-ranked comments, top-ranked comments are more likely to emphasize the majority opinion and incur redundancy. In this paper, we propose a top K comment diversification re-ranking model using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and evaluate its impact in three categories: (1) semantic diversity, (2) inclusion of the semantics of lower-ranked comments, and (3) redundancy, within the context of a HarvardX course discussion forum. We conducted a double-blind, small-scale evaluation experiment requiring subjects to select between the top 5 comments of a diversified ranking and a baseline ranking ordered by score. For three subjects, across 100 trials, subjects selected the diversified (75% score, 25% diversification) ranking as significantly (1) more diverse, (2) more inclusive, and (3) less redundant. Within each category, inter-rater reliability showed moderate consistency, with typical Cohen-Kappa scores near 0.2. Our findings suggest that our model improves (1) diversification, (2) inclusion, and (3) redundancy, among top K ranked comments in online discussion forums."

We present an ALMA survey of H$_2$CO towards 15 disks covering a range of stellar spectral types, stellar ages, and dust continuum morphologies. H$_2$CO is detected towards 13 disks and tentatively detected towards a 14th. We find both centrally-peaked and centrally-depressed emission morphologies, and half of the disks show ring-like structures at or beyond expected CO snowline locations. Together these morphologies suggest that H$_2$CO in disks is commonly produced through both gas-phase and CO-ice-regulated grain-surface chemistry. We extract disk-averaged and azimuthally-averaged H$_2$CO excitation temperatures and column densities for four disks with multiple H$_2$CO line detections. The temperatures are between 20-50K, with the exception of colder temperatures in the DM Tau disk. These temperatures suggest that H$_2$CO emission in disks is generally emerging from the warm molecular layer, with some contributions from the colder midplane. Applying the same H$_2$CO excitation temperatures to all disks in the survey, we find that H$_2$CO column densities span almost three orders of magnitude ($\sim 5 \times 10^{11} - 5 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). The column densities appear uncorrelated with disk size and stellar age, but Herbig Ae disks may have less H$_2$CO compared to T Tauri disks, possibly because of less CO freeze-out. More H$_2$CO observations towards Herbig Ae disks are needed to confirm this tentative trend, and to better constrain under which disk conditions H$_2$CO and other oxygen-bearing organics efficiently form during planet formation."

Part of the design goal was to minimize the possibility of user errors which distract from the learning process. Such as typos or inconsistent application of the provided rules. The system includes a zoomable proof viewer which displays the progress made so far and allows for storage of the completed proofs as a JPEG or LaTeX file. The software is available on the google play store and comes with a small library of problems. Additional problems may be opened in AXolotl using a simple input language. Currently, AXolotl supports problems that can be solved using rules which transform a single expression into a set of expressions. This covers educational scenarios found in our first-semester introduction to logic course and helps bridge the gap between propositional and first-order reasoning. Future developments will include rewrite rules which take a set of expressions and return a set of expressions, as well as a quantified first-order extension."

One such condition is pressure overload where elevated wall stresses stimulate the growth in cardiomyocyte thickness, associated with a phenotype of concentric hypertrophy at the organ scale, and promote fibrosis. The initial hypertrophic response can be considered adaptive and beneficial by favoring myocyte survival, but over time if pressure overload conditions persist, maladaptive mechanisms favoring cell death and fibrosis start to dominate, ultimately mediating the transition towards an overt heart failure phenotype. The underlying mechanisms linking biological factors at the myocyte level to biomechanical factors at the systemic and organ level remain poorly understood. Computational models of G&R show high promise as a unique framework for providing a quantitative link between myocardial stresses and strains at the organ scale to biological regulatory processes at the cellular level which govern the hypertrophic response. However, microstructurally motivated, rigorously validated computational models of G&R are still in their infancy. This article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of computational models to study cardiac G&R. The microstructure and mechanosensing/mechanotransduction within cells of the myocardium is discussed and quantitative data from previous experimental and clinical studies is summarized. We conclude with a discussion of major challenges and possible directions of future research that can advance the current state of cardiac G&R computational modeling."

Consequently, the demand for and development of label-free methodologies to classify cells is strong and its impact on precision medicine is relevant. Towards this end, high-throughput techniques for cell mechanical phenotyping have been proposed to get a multidimensional biophysical characterization of single cells. With this motivation, our goal here is to investigate the extent to which an unsupervised machine learning methodology, which is applied exclusively on morpho-rheological markers obtained by real-time deformability and fluorescence cytometry (RT-FDC), can address the difficult task of providing label-free discrimination of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells. We focused on this problem, since the characterization of reticulocytes (their percentage and cellular features) in the blood is vital in multiple human disease conditions, especially bone-marrow disorders such as anemia and leukemia. Our approach reports promising label-free results in the classification of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells, and it represents a step forward in the development of high-throughput morpho-rheological-based methodologies for the computational categorization of single cells. Besides, our methodology can be an alternative but also a complementary method to integrate with existing cell-labelling techniques."

However, simulations face the problem that nucleation is an activated process. Therefore, rare event simulation techniques are needed to promote the formation of the critical nucleus. The Seeding method, where the simulations are started with the nucleus already formed, has proven quite useful in efficiently providing estimates of the nucleation rate for a wide range of orders of magnitude. So far, Seeding has been employed in the NPT ensemble, where the nucleus either grows or redissolves. Thus, several trajectories have to be run in order to find the thermodynamic conditions that make the seeded nucleus critical. Moreover, the nucleus lifetime is short and the statistics for obtaining its properties is consequently poor. To deal with these shortcomings we extend the Seeding method to the NVT ensemble. We focus on the problem of bubble nucleation in a mestastable Lennard Jones fluid. We show that, in the NVT ensemble, it is possible to equilibrate and stabilise critical bubbles for a long time. The nucleation rate inferred from NVT-Seeding is fully consistent with that coming from NPT-Seeding. The former is quite suitable to obtain the nucleation rate along isotherms, whereas the latter is preferable if the dependence of the rate with temperature at constant pressure is required. Care should be taken with finite size effects when using NVT-Seeding. Further work is required to extend NVT seeding to other sorts of phase transitions."

Here we calculate the disjoining pressure curve of premelting films, and perform a detailed thermodynamic characterization of premelting behavior on ice. Analysis of the density profiles reveals the signature of weak layering phenomena, from one to two and from two to three water molecular layers. However, disjoining pressure curves, which closely follow expectations from a renormalized mean field liquid state theory, show that there are no layering phase transitions in the thermodynamic sense along the sublimation line. Instead, we find that transitions at mean field level are rounded due to capillary wave fluctuations. We see signatures that true first order layering transitions could arise at low temperatures, for pressures between the metastable line of water/vapor coexistence and the sublimation line. The extrapolation of the disjoining pressure curve above water vapor saturation displays a true first order phase transition from a thin to a thick film consistent with experimental observations."

Firstly, based on a family of operators generated by strongly continuous semigroups and on a probability density function, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the exponential stability of the considered class of systems. Then, by assuming that the system dynamics is symmetric and uniformly elliptic and by using the properties of the Mittag-Leffler function, we provide sufficient conditions that ensure strong stability. Finally, we characterize an explicit feedback control that guarantees the strong stabilization of a controlled Caputo time fractional linear system through a decomposition approach. Some examples are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of our results."

Anisotropic magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 0.4 K indicate a complete absence of long-range magnetic order. Despite this lack of long-range order, short-range antiferromagnetic interactions are evidenced through broad transitions, suggesting frustrated behavior. Variable magnetic field measurements reveal metamagnetic behavior at temperatures less than 2 K. Complex low temperature field-tunable magnetic behavior, in addition to no observable long-range order down to 0.4 K, suggest that TlYbS$_2$ is a frustrated magnet and a possible quantum spin liquid candidate."

Recently experimental searching for this azimuthal asymmetry in dihadron SIDIS by the COMPASS Collaboration yielded a very small signal. Here we calculate this unknown T-odd DiFF $G_1^\perp$ using a spectator model to access the asymmetry and clarify why the signal is very small. The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization method, in which the transverse momentum of the final state hadron pair leaves unintegrated, has been applied. We estimate the $\sin(\phi_h-\phi_R)$ asymmetry at the kinematics of COMPASS experiments and compare with the data. What's more, the predictions on the same asymmetry are also made at the Electron Ion Collider (EIC)."

Crystallization rates are also considered to be useful probes of glass-forming ability. At the microscopic level, crystallization is described by the classical crystal nucleation and growth theories, yet in general solid formation is a far more complex process. In particular, the observation of apparently different crystal growth regimes in many binary liquid mixtures greatly challenges our understanding of crystallization. Here, we study by experiments, theory and computer simulations the crystallization of supercooled mixtures of argon and krypton, showing that crystal growth rates in these systems can be reconciled with existing crystal growth models only by explicitly accounting for the non-ideality of the mixtures. Our results highlight the importance of thermodynamic aspects in describing the crystal growth kinetics, providing a substantial step towards a more sophisticated theory of crystal growth."

This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with elastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural and hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements and experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor of 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive parameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is to demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These parameters will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal hydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the clustering. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental data."

We tackle this problem for images. We consider a two-phase approach. First, using normal examples, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is trained to extract a low-dimensional representation of the images. Here, we propose a novel architectural choice when designing the CAE, an Inception-like CAE. It combines convolutional filters of different kernel sizes and it uses a Global Average Pooling (GAP) operation to extract the representations from the CAE's bottleneck layer. Second, we employ a distanced-based anomaly detector in the low-dimensional space of the learned representation for the images. However, instead of computing the exact distance, we compute an approximate distance using product quantization. This alleviates the high memory and prediction time costs of distance-based anomaly detectors. We compare our proposed approach to a number of baselines and state-of-the-art methods on four image datasets, and we find that our approach resulted in improved predictive performance."

Both argon and xenon possess closed-shell electronic structures, which renders them chemically unreactive. Using unbiased structure searching techniques combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the reaction of argon with xenon at a pressure as low as 1.1 GPa, producing a novel van der Waals compound XeAr2, which crystallizes in the MgCu2-type Laves phase structure. Due to the pressure-induced delocalization of the electrons in outermost shells, the covalent Xe-Xe and Xe-Ar bonds have been detected which lead XeAr2 to be unexpectedly stable without any phase transition or decomposition at least up to 500 GPa."

When increasing temperature above room temperature, FeRh displays an uncommon antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition linked to a unit cell volume expansion. Thus, using the strain exerted by an adjacent piezoelectric layer, the relative amount of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions can be tuned by an electric field applied to the piezoelectric material. Indeed, large variations in the saturation magnetization have been observed when straining FeRh films grown on suitable piezoelectric substrates. In view of its applications, the variations in the remanent magnetization rather than those of the saturation magnetization are the most relevant. Here, we show that in the absence of any bias external magnetic field, permanent and reversible magnetization changes as high as 34% can be induced by an electric field, which remain after this has been zeroed. Bulk and local magnetoelectric characterization reveals that the fundamental reason for the large magnetoelectric response observed at remanence is the expansion (rather than the nucleation) of ferromagnetic nanoregions."

The hierarchical architecture of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of these materials allows for distinct directionality of the vibrational modes withrespect to the main axes of the pseudocubic lattice in the octahedral plane. Here, we study the directionality of the fundamental phonon modes in single exfoliated Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite flakes with polarized Raman spectroscopy at ultralow-frequencies. A wealth of Raman bands is distinguished in the range from 15-150 cm-1 (2-15 meV), whose features depend on the organic cation species, on temperature, and on the direction of the linear polarization of the incident light. By controlling the angle of the linear polarization of the excitation laser with respect to the in-plane axes of the octahedral layer, we gain detailed information on the symmetry of the vibrational modes. The choice of two different organic moieties, phenethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium (BA) allows to discern the influence of the linker molecules, evidencing strong anisotropy of the vibrations for the (PEA)2PbBr4 samples. Temperature dependent Raman measurements reveal that the broad phonon bands observed at room temperature consist of a series of sharp modes, and that such mode splitting strongly differs for the different organic moieties and vibrational bands."

Many experiments have studied wrinkle formation during the compression of a rigid film on a relatively soft pre-strained elastic substrate, and most have focused on the regime where the substrate thickness can be considered semi-infinite relative to that of the film. As the relative thickness of the substrate is decreased, the bending stiffness of the film dominates, causing the bilayer to transition to either local wrinkling or a global buckling instability. In this work optical microscopy was used to study the critical parameters that determine the emergence of local wrinkling or global buckling of freestanding bilayer films consisting of a thin rigid polymer capping layer on a pre-strained elastomeric substrate. The thickness ratio of the film and substrate as well as the pre-strain were controlled and used to create a buckling phase diagram which describes the behaviour of the system as the ratio of the thickness of the substrate is decreased. A simple force balance model was developed to understand the thickness and strain dependences of the wrinkling and buckling modes, with excellent quantitative agreement being obtained with experiments using only independently measured material parameters."

In the present article, we introduce a new general formalism describing the unitary evolution of a qudit $(d\geq2)$ in terms of the Bloch-like vector space and specify how in a general case this formalism is related to finding time-dependent parameters in the exponential representation of the evolution operator under an arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonian. Applying this new general formalism to a qubit case $(d=2)$, we specify the unitary evolution of a qubit via the evolution of a unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and this allows us to derive the precise analytical expression of the qubit unitary evolution operator for a wide class of nonstationary Hamiltonians. This new analytical expression includes the qubit solutions known in the literature only as particular cases."

These two tasks are usually accomplished by a sophisticated and demanding structuring of the optical environment in which the emitter is immersed, or by non-trivial chemical engineering of its geometry and/or band structure. In this paper, the wavelength and polarization selective spontaneous emission from a dye-embedded in a Metal/Insulator/Metal (d-MIM) nanocavity is demonstrated. A push-pull chromophore with large Stokes shift is embedded in a MIM cavity whose resonances are tuned with the spectral emission band of the chromophore. Angular and polarization resolved spectroscopy experiments reveal that the radiated field is reshaped according to the angular dispersion of the nanocavity, and that its spectrum manifests two bands with different polarization corresponding to the p- and s-polarized resonances of the cavity. The d-MIM cavities are a highly versatile system for polarization and wavelength division multiplexing applications at the nanoscale, as well as for near-field focused emission and nanolenses."

Although classic electromagnetic theory accurately describes their behavior, it often lacks physical insight, letting some fundamental aspects of light interaction with these structures unexplored. In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical description of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well. We identify the square of the imaginary part of the refractive index of the metal as the optical potential, and find that MIM cavity resonances are suppressed if the ratio n/\k{appa} exceeds a certain limit, which shows that low n and high \k{appa} are desired for strong and sharp cavity resonances. Interestingly, the spectral regions of cavity mode suppression correspond to the interband transitions of the metals, where the optical processes are intrinsically non-Hermitian. The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for photons, and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant tunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum matching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this analysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures, and by developing a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of its effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with low-loss zeros of the effective permittivity."

Furthermore, the potential of flat optics can go far beyond far-field modulation, and can be exploited for functionality in the near-field itself. Here, we design metasurfaces based on aperiodic arrays of plasmonic Au nanostructures for tailoring the optical near-field in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. The basic element of the arrays is a rhomboid that is modulated in size, orientation and position to achieve the desired functionality of the micron-size metasurface structure. Using two-photon-photoluminescence as a tool to probethe near-field profiles in the plane of the metasurfaces, we demonstrate the molding of light into different near-field intensity patterns and active pattern control via the far-field illumination. Finite element method simulations reveal that the near-field modulation occurs via a combination of the plasmonic resonances of the rhomboids and field enhancement in the nanoscale gaps in between the elements. This approach enables optical elements that can switch the near-field distribution across the metasurface via wavelength and polarization of the incident far-field light, and provides pathways for light matter interaction in integrated devices."

Such fluctuations are commonly caused by beam wandering around the receiving aperture. We study the possibility to stabilize the fluctuations by expanding the beam, and test this channel stabilization in regard of continuous-variable entanglement sharing and quantum key distribution. We perform transmittance measurements of a real free-space atmospheric channel for different beam widths and show that the beam expansion reduces the fluctuations of the channel transmittance by the cost of an increased overall loss. We also theoretically study the possibility to share an entangled state or to establish secure quantum key distribution over the turbulent atmospheric channels with varying beam widths. We show the positive effect of channel stabilization by beam expansion on continuous-variable quantum communication as well as the necessity to optimize the method in order to maximize the secret key rate or the amount of shared entanglement. Being autonomous and not requiring adaptive control of the source and detectors based on characterization of beam wandering, the method of beam expansion can be also combined with other methods aiming at stabilizing the fluctuating free-space atmospheric channels."

We report an easy and reliable method to grow millimeter-sized single crystals of this trimer based spin liquid candidate material with the actual stoichiometry of Ba4Nb0.8Ir3.2O12. The growth of large crystals is achieved using BaCl2 as flux. The crystals show hexagonal plate-like habit with edges up to 3 mm in length. The structure is confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and is found to be the same as of previously reported phase Ba12Nb2.4Ir9.6O36 [Ba4Nb0.8Ir3.2O12], indeed with a mixed occupancy of Nb/Ir at 3a site. The magnetic and calorimetric study on the individual single crystals confirms the possibility of a spin liquid state consistent with a recent report on a polycrystalline sample"

On one hand, the NC emission depends critically on the passivation of the surface to minimize trap states that can provide non-radiative recombination channels. On the other hand, the electrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute the barriers for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore, surface modifications via ligandexchange have been employed to improve the conductance of NC films. However, in light emitting devices, such surface modifications are more critical due to their possible detrimental effects on the emission properties. In this work, we study the role of surface ligand modifications on the optical and electrical properties of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods (DiRs) in films, and investigate their performance in all-solution processed LEDs. The DiR films maintain high PLQY, around 40-50%, and their electroluminescence in the LED preserves the excellent color purity of the PL. In the LEDs, the ligand-exchange boosted the luminance, reaching a four-fold increase from 2200 cd/m2 for native surfactants to 8500 cd/m2 for the exchanged aminoethanethiol ligands. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off, operational stability, and shelf life are significantly improved, and the external quantum efficiency is modestly increased from 5.1 % to 5.4 %. We relate these improvements to the increased conductivity of the emissive layer, and to the better charge balance of the electrically injected carriers. In this respect, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to obtain deeper insight in the band alignment of the LED structure."

Current clinical practice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although that may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its interaction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled. (Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a target is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally invasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and needle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often be computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed games to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in tissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which abstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears to be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the model, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise motion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those strategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable behavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to implement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the real system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle tip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We have implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a flexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in medical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments show that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle motions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm."

Relying only on fundamental principles of general relativity, we can set upper limits on the size, mass, and distance of the source solely from characteristics of the observed waveform. If the distance of the source is known from independent (e.g. electromagnetic) observations, we can also set lower limits on the mass and size. As a demonstration, we tested these constraints on binary black hole signals observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors during their first and second observing runs, as well as on simulated binary black hole and core-collapse supernova signals reconstructed from simulated detector data. We have found that our constraints are valid for all analyzed source types, but their efficiency (namely, how far they are from the true parameter values) strongly depends on the source type, ranging from being in the same order of magnitude to a several orders of magnitude difference. In cases when a gravitational-wave signal is reconstructed without waveform templates and no astrophysical model on the source is available, these constraints provide the only quantitative characterization of the source that can guide the astrophysical modeling process."

We have also presented the evolution of the photon sphere for slowly rotating Kerr-Vaidya spacetime and associated structure of black hole shadow. Finally, the effective graviton metric for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity has been presented, and the graviton sphere has been contrasted with the photon sphere in this context."

This involves designing optimal pricing and routing schemes for the setting where users cannot directly choose which station they use. Instead, they choose their priority level and energy request amount from the differentiated service menu, and then the CNO directly assigns them to a station on their path. This allows higher priority users to experience lower wait times at stations, and allows the CNO to directly manage demand, exerting a higher level of control that can be used to manage the effect of EV on the grid and control station wait times. We consider the scenarios where the CNO is a social welfare-maximizing or a profit-maximizing entity, and in both cases, design pricing-routing policies that ensure users reveal their true parameters to the CNO."

Here we turn attention to the portrayal of women in movies, an industry that has a significant influence on society, impacting such aspects of life as self-esteem and career choice. To this end, we fused data from the online movie database IMDb with a dataset of movie dialogue subtitles to create the largest available corpus of movie social networks (15,540 networks). Analyzing this data, we investigated gender bias in on-screen female characters over the past century. We find a trend of improvement in all aspects of women`s roles in movies, including a constant rise in the centrality of female characters. There has also been an increase in the number of movies that pass the well-known Bechdel test, a popular--albeit flawed--measure of women in fiction. Here we propose a new and better alternative to this test for evaluating female roles in movies. Our study introduces fresh data, an open-code framework, and novel techniques that present new opportunities in the research and analysis of movies."

From the LT light curves between 2015 December and 2018 August, we derive at once a time delay of 25.0 $\pm$ 1.5 days (1$\sigma$ confidence interval; A is leading) and microlensing magnification gradients below 10$^{-4}$ mag day$^{-1}$. The delay interval is not expected to be affected by an appreciable microlensing--induced bias, so it can be used to estimate cosmological parameters. This paper also focuses on new Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and LT spectroscopic observations of the lens system. We determine the redshift of two bright galaxies around the doubly imaged quasar using LT spectroscopy, while GTC data lead to low--noise individual spectra of A, B, and the main lensing galaxy G1. The G1 spectral shape is accurately matched to an early--type galaxy template at $z$ = 0.284, and it has potential for further relevant studies. Additionally, the quasar spectra show absorption by metal--rich gas at $z \sim$ 2. This dusty absorber is responsible for an extinction bump at a rest--frame wavelength of 2209 $\pm$ 2 \AA, which has strengths of $\sim$ 0.47 and 0.76 mag $\mu$m$^{-1}$ for A and B, respectively. In such intervening system, the dust--to--gas ratio, gas--phase metallicity indicator [Zn/H], and dust depletion level [Fe/Zn] are relatively high."

We perform a posteriori error analysis of Galerkin approximations and derive a reliable and efficient estimate for the energy error in these approximations. Practical versions of this error estimate are discussed and tested numerically for a model problem with non-affine parametric representation of the coefficient. Furthermore, we use the error reduction indicators derived from spatial and parametric error estimators to guide an adaptive solution algorithm for the given parametric PDE problem.

It is acknowledged that decreasing the risk in this domain requires consideration of the technological aspects of information security alongside human aspects. Employees intentionally or unintentionally account for a significant portion of the threats to information assets in organisations. This research presents a novel conceptual framework to mitigate the risk of insiders using deterrence and prevention approaches. Deterrence factors discourage employees from engaging in information security misbehaviour in organisations, and situational crime prevention factors encourage them to prevent information security misconduct. Our findings show that perceived sanctions certainty and severity significantly influence individuals' attitudes and deter them from information security misconduct. In addition, the output revealed that increasing the effort, risk and reducing the reward (benefits of crime) influence the employees' attitudes towards prevent information security misbehaviour. However, removing excuses and reducing provocations do not significantly influence individuals' attitudes towards prevent information security misconduct. Finally, the output of the data analysis also showed that subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitude influence individuals' intentions, and, ultimately, their behaviour towards avoiding information security misbehaviour."

An off-lattice modelling approach is considered whereby: (i) every cell is identified by the position of its centre; (ii) mechanical interactions between cells are described via generic nonlinear force laws; and (iii) cell proliferation is contact inhibited. We formally show that the continuum counterpart of this discrete model is given by a free-boundary problem for the cell densities. The results of the derivation demonstrate how the parameters of continuum mechanical models of multicellular systems can be related to biophysical cell properties. We prove an existence result for the free-boundary problem and construct travelling-wave solutions. Numerical simulations are performed in the case where the cellular interaction forces are described by the celebrated Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model of elastic contact, which has been previously used to model cell-cell interactions. The results obtained indicate excellent agreement between the simulation results for the individual-based model, the numerical solutions of the corresponding free-boundary problem and the travelling-wave analysis."

The key idea underlying our approach is to use the commuting conserved charges of the quantum integrable models to generate the basis in which their spectral problem is $separated$, i.e. in which the wave functions are factorized in terms of specific solutions of a functional equation. For the so-called ""non-fundamental"" models we construct two different SoV basis. The first is given from the fundamental quantum Lax operator having isomorphic auxiliary and quantum spaces and that can be obtained by fusion of the original quantum Lax operator. The construction essentially follows the one we used previously for fundamental models and allows us to derive the simplicity and diagonalizability of the transfer matrix spectrum. Then, starting from the original quantum Lax operator and using the full tower of the fused transfer matrices, we introduce a second SoV basis for which the proof of the separation of the transfer matrix spectrum is naturally derived. We show that, under some special choice, this second SoV basis coincides with the one associated to the Sklyanin's approach. Moreover, we derive the finite difference type (quantum spectral curve) functional equation and the set of its solution defining the complete transfer matrix spectrum. This is explicitly implemented for the integrable quantum models associated to the higher spin representations of the general quasi-periodic $Y(gl_{2})$ Yang-Baxter algebra. Our SoV approach also leads to the construction of a $Q$-operator in terms of the fused transfer matrices. Finally, we show that the $Q$-operator family can be equivalently used as the family of commuting conserved charges enabling to construct our SoV basis."

We calculated the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) using Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential for 5097 non-metallic materials and identified 1997 candidates with an SLME higher than 10%, including 934 candidates with suitable convex-hull stability and effective carrier mass.

In this paper, we demonstrate a local engineering of the exciton photoluminescence (PL) energy of monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) by means of strain. We apply a local uniaxial stress to WS2 by exploiting electron-beam patterned and actuated polymeric micrometric artificial muscles (MAMs), which we implement onto monolithic synthetic WS2/graphene heterostructures. We show that MAMs are able to induce an in-plane stress to the top WS2 layer of the van der Waals heterostructure and that the latter can slide on the graphene underneath with negligible friction. As a proof of concept for the local strain-induced PL shift experiments, we exploit a two-MAM configuration in order to apply uniaxial tensile stress on well-defined micrometric regions of WS2. Remarkably, our architecture does not require the adoption of fragile suspended microstructures. We observe a spatial modulation of the excitonic PL energy of the WS2 monolayers under stress, which agrees with the expected strain profile and attains a maximum redshift of about 40 meV at the maximum strain intensity point. After the actuation, a time-dependent PL blueshift is observed in agreement with the viscoelastic properties of the polymeric MAMs. Our approach enables inducing local and arbitrary deformation profiles and circumvents some key limitations and technical challenges of alternative strain engineering methods requiring the 2D material transfer and production of suspended membranes."

The two sites of the unit cell have an energy shift between them, whose competition with the spin-dependent strength is the main focus of this paper. Charge density wave (CDW) phases appear for semi-integer and integer densities, leading to rich phase diagrams with Mott insulator, superfluid and CDW phases. The spin-dependent interaction favors insulator phases for integer densities and disfavors CDW phases for semi-integer densities, which tend to disappear. Also, quantum phase transitions at finite values of the spin-dependent strength were observed. For integer densities, Mott insulator-superfluid-CDW insulator transitions appear for an energy shift lower (higher) than the local repulsion for the global density $\rho=1$ ($\rho=2$)."

Beyond these counterparts, compact binary mergers are additionally predicted to be accompanied by prompt low-frequency radio emission. The successful observation of a prompt radio counterpart would be immensely valuable, but is made difficult by the short delay between the gravitational-wave and prompt electromagnetic signals as well as the poor localization of gravitational-wave sources. Here, we present the first search for prompt radio emission accompanying a gravitational-wave event, targeting the binary black hole merger GW170104 detected by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories during their second (O2) observing run. Using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), we search a $\sim900\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ region for transient radio emission within approximately one hour of GW170104, obtaining an upper limit of $2.5\times10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on its equivalent isotropic luminosity between 27-84 MHz. We additionally discuss plans to target binary neutron star mergers in Advanced LIGO and Virgo's upcoming O3 observing run."

This paper describes CALICO, a method for camera network and/or multi-camera calibration suitable for challenging contexts: the cameras may not share a common field of view and the network may be asynchronous. The calibration object required is one or more rigidly attached planar calibration patterns, which are distinguishable from one another, such as aruco or charuco patterns.   We formulate the camera network and/or multi-camera calibration problem using rigidity constraints, represented as a system of equations, and an approximate solution is found through a two-step process. Simulated and real experiments, including an asynchronous camera network, multicamera system, and rotating imaging system, demonstrate the method in a variety of settings. Median reconstruction accuracy error was less than $0.41$ mm$^2$ for all datasets. This method is suitable for novice users to calibrate a camera network, and the modularity of the calibration object also allows for disassembly, shipping, and the use of this method in a variety of large and small spaces."

Exploring Infiltration   Strategies,"Socialbots are intelligent software controlling all the behavior of fake accounts in an online social network. They use artificial intelligence techniques to pass themselves off as human social media users. Socialbots exploit user trust to achieve their malicious goals, such as astroturfing, performing Sybil attacks, spamming, and harvesting private data. The first phase to countermeasure the malicious activities of the socialbots is studying their characteristics and revealing strategies they can employ to successfully infiltrate stealthily into target online social network. In this paper,we investigate the success of using different infiltration strategies in terms of infiltration performance and being stealthy. Every strategy is characterized by socialbots profile and behavioral characteristics. The findings from this study illustrate that assuming a specific taste for the tweets a socialbot retweets and/or likes make it more influential. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that considering the presence of common characteristics and similarity increase the probability of being followed by other users. This is in complete agreement with homophily concept which is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others in social networks."

Having such knowledge available at all times would enable them to continually adjust their systems structure at each juncture and reduce the buildup of technical debt that can be hard to reduce once it has persisted over many iterations. Unfortunately, software systems often lack reliable and current documentation about their architecture. In order to remedy this situation, researchers have conceived a number of architectural recovery methods, some of them concern-oriented. However, the design choices forming the bases of most existing recovery methods make it so none of them have a complete set of desirable qualities for the purpose stated above. Tailoring a recovery to a system is either not possible or only through iterative experiments with numeric parameters. Furthermore, limitations in their scalability make it prohibitive to apply the existing techniques to large systems. Finally, since several current recovery methods employ non-deterministic sampling, their inconsistent results do not lend themselves well to tracking a systems course over several versions, as needed by its stakeholders. RELAX (RELiable Architecture EXtraction), a new concern-based recovery method that uses text classification, addresses these issues efficiently by (1) assembling the overall recovery result from smaller, independent parts, (2) basing it on an algorithm with linear time complexity and (3) being tailorable to the recovery of a single system or a sequence thereof through the selection of meaningfully named, semantic topics. An intuitive, informative architectural visualization rounds out RELAX's contributions. RELAX is illustrated on a number of existing open-source systems and compared to other recovery methods."

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming ""enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques."

The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions are made during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to a one-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems engineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each subsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem engineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal of the systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing the subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based system-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the design requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of an Earth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines the optimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the propulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of a systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements and incentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficulty and associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and subsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the systems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the model predicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirements are higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability of failure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for large task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than the true ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation."

This ASIC is based on a previously submitted demonstrator ASIC designed for timing performance evaluation, and includes all features necessary for the various operation modes, as well as the migration to the TSMC 130 nm CMOS technology. We present the TDC design with the emphasis on added features and performance optimization. Tests of the timing performance demonstrate that this ASIC meets the design specifications. The TDC has a bin size of about 780 ps, and a timing bin variations within 40 ps for all 24 channels with leading and trailing edge digitization, while the power consumption has been limited to 250 mW, corresponding to a consumption of about 5.2 mW per edge measurement."

Authority, which validates attributes of subjects, is one key component to facilitate attribute-based access control. In an increasingly decentralized society, multiple attributes possessed by subjects may need to be validated by multiple different authorities. This paper proposes a multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme by using Ethereum's smart contracts. In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object. The smart contracts for multi-authority attribute-based access control have been prototyped in Solidity, and their performance has been evaluated on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet."

Our dataset is novel in that every question is paired with a table of a different signature. In particular, the dataset contains two classes of tables: entity-instance tables and the key-value tables. Each QA instance comprises a table of either kind, a natural language question, and a corresponding structured SQL query. We build our model by dividing question answering into several tasks, including table retrieval and question element classification, and conduct experiments to measure the performance of each task. We extract various features specific to each task and compose a full pipeline which constructs the SQL query from its parts. Our work provides qualitative results and error analysis for each task, and identifies in detail the reasoning required to generate SQL expressions from natural language questions. This analysis of reasoning informs future models based on neural machine learning."

As quantum resources, the population, the coherence and even the entanglement of the system would gradually leak out of the cavity. The effect from the leakage of the cavity-mode to the uncontrollable degree of freedom, e.g., environment, is however not always negative to particular targets. A well-established scenario is that a photon counter attached to the cavity would absorb and then record the leaking photon. As a medium between the system and the photon counter, a strong coupling between system and cavity is necessary to enhance the measurement efficiency. While we find it also reduce the reading efficiency of the photon counter at the same time as fewer photons leak out of the cavity. We investigate the competition between these two mechanisms in the framework of non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics, where the photon counter serves as a general bosonic environment. Our results provide an optimized parameter space for system entanglement preservation and generation."

All the three alloys are found to crystallize in cubic structure. CoRuMnGe exhibits L2$_1$ structure whereas, the other two alloys have B2-type disorder. For CoRuMnGe and CoRuVGa, the experimental magnetic moments are in close agreement with the theory as well as those predicted by the Slater-Pauling rule, while for CoRuVAl, a relatively large deviation is seen. The reduction in the moment in case of CoRuVAl possibly arises due to the anti-site disorder between Co and Ru sites as well as V and Al sites. Among these alloys, CoRuMnGe has the highest T$\mathrm{_C}$ of 560 K. Resistivity variation with temperature reflects the half-metallic nature in CoRuMnGe alloy. CoRuVAl shows metallic character in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, whereas the temperature dependence of resistivity for CoRuVGa is quite unusual. In the last system, $\rho$ vs. T curve shows an anomaly in the form of a maximum and a region of negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) in the magnetically ordered state. The ab initio calculations predict nearly half-metallic ferromagnetic state with high spin polarization of 91, 89 and 93 \% for CoRuMnGe, CoRuVAl and CoRuVGa respectively. To investigate the electronic properties of the experimentally observed structure, the Co-Ru swap disordered structures of CoRuMnGe alloy are also simulated and it is found that the disordered structures retain half-metallic nature, high spin polarization with almost same magnetic moment as in the ideal structure. Nearly half-metallic character, high T$\mathrm{_C}$ and high spin polarization make CoRuMnGe alloy promising for room temperature spintronic applications."

Assuming that each agent has access to a stochastic first-order oracle ($\mathcal{SFO}$), we propose a novel distributed method, called $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$, where each agent uses an auxiliary variable to asymptotically track the gradient of the global cost in expectation. The $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ algorithm employs row- and column-stochastic weights simultaneously to ensure both consensus and optimality. Since doubly-stochastic weights are not used, $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ is applicable to arbitrary strongly-connected graphs. We show that under a sufficiently small constant step-size, $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ converges linearly (in expected mean-square sense) to a neighborhood of the global minimizer. We present numerical simulations based on real-world data sets to illustrate the theoretical results."

Equivalently, we can see this problem as controlling the target variables of a structured system, where the state variables of the system are associated to the nodes of the network. We deal with this problem from a different point of view as compared to most recent literature. Indeed, instead of considering controllability in the Kalman sense, that is, as the ability to drive the target states to a desired value, we consider the stronger requirement of driving the target variables as time functions. The latter notion is called functional target controllability. We think that restricting the controllability requirement to a limited set of important variables justifies using a more accurate notion of controllability for these variables. Remarkably, the notion of functional controllability allows formulating very simple graphical conditions for target controllability in the spirit of the structural approach to controllability. The functional approach enables us, moreover, to determine the smallest set of steering nodes that need to be actuated to ensure target controllability, where these steering nodes are constrained to belong to a given set. We show that such a smallest set can be found in polynomial time. We are also able to classify the possible actuated variables in terms of their importance with respect to the functional target controllability problem."

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis."

This family of cyclic codes is not projective. Many authors have studied the weight distribution of these codes for certain parameters. In this paper, we prove that these codes are never two-weight codes. This result would strengthen a conjecture by Vega which states that all two-weight cyclic codes are the ""known"" ones."

While these generalize our previous result on the Euclidean anti-de Sitter space, their validity in here is restricted only to odd dimensions in both instances. The exact Wightman function for the de Sitter space is then derived analytically. The GGR transform fixes the coefficient of the Wightman function. For the anti-de Sitter space it is shown that a reconstruction formula exists for the case of time-like boundary as well. The restriction on the domain of integration on the boundary is derived. As a special case, we point out that the formula is valid for the BTZ black hole as well."

Specifically, we study the dynamics of population imbalance between even and odd sites, and the growth of the von Neumann entropy. For a large potential gradient, the imbalance is found to decay on a time scale that grows quadratically with the Wannier-Stark tilt. For the non-interacting system, it shows an exponential decay, which becomes a stretched exponential decay in the presence of finite interactions. This is different from a system with disorder-induced localization, where the imbalance exhibits a stretched exponential decay also for vanishing interactions. As another clear qualitative difference, we do not find a logarithmically slow growth of the von-Neumann entropy as it is found for the disordered system. Our findings can immediately be tested experimentally with ultracold atoms in optical lattices."

Where energy conservation in a finite-element approximation of the relativistic collision operator was previously thought to be elusive, it is now achieved even with linear elements. The same result applies to the nonrelativistic Landau operator for which the energy conservation was thought to require at least quadratic elements. In both cases, the momentum and density conservation are guaranteed as previously. The new outcomes benefit from the findings reported in a recent finite-difference-scheme paper [Shiroto & Sentoku, arXiv:1902.07866] which we generalize to the finite-element method. This note focuses solely on the direct discretization of the collision operator, leaving the discretization of the underlying metriplectic formulation of the relativistic collision operator to future publications."

We also prove that in the above result we can further restrict our attention to various natural classes of structures, including (generalized) trees, graphs, or groups. This fully generalizes to the uncountable case the main results of [LR05,FMR11,Wil14,CMR17]."

I demonstrate how three duality theorems listed by Rowe, Repka, and Carvalho allow very brief derivations of linear relations between the Casimir invariants of the connected representations based on the geometry of their Young diagrams, and discuss for which physical systems other than such already considered in the literature an analysis in terms of the orthogonal-orthogonal duality might be useful."

Recently, a simple mechanism was proposed in which one of the main features of NM, the backflow of information from the environment to the system, represents a fundamental and quantifiable resource for generating entanglement within an open quantum system coupled to a finite and small environment [N. Mirkin, P. Poggi and D. Wisniacki, Phys. Rev. A, 99(2), 020301(R)]. In this work, we extend the universality of this resource mechanism by studying a completely different and more general scheme where the system is coupled to an infinite structured reservoir. Under both setups, we show that the degree of NM univocally determines the optimal degree of entanglement reachable by controlling the open system. This result reveals the universality of a quantitative relation between entanglement and NM by using quantum optimal control."

In this paper we present a supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified embedding of this idea with Yukawa couplings generated by {\bf 10}, ${\bf \overline{126}}$ and {\bf 120} Higgs fields. This model is known to provide a unified description of masses and mixings of quarks and leptons. When CP symmetry is imposed on this model, the discrete gauge subgroup C of SO(10) combines with it to generate an effective parity symmetry, leading to hermitian quark mass matrices. Imposing an additional discrete symmetry, $G$, we show that there are no other tree level sources of $\theta$ in the model; $G$ also guarantees that the one- and two-loop contributions to $\theta$ vanish. We then show that the leading three-loop effects and the effect of higher-dimensional operators invariant under $G$ give rise to $\theta$ near the current experimental bound, making the model testable in the current searches for neutron electric dipole moment."

We settle this open question in affirmative in the absence of an external pressure. Our method is based on energy estimates for the quotient, $q = \frac{v}{\bar{u}}$, $\bar{u}$ being the classical Prandtl solution, via the linear Derivative Prandtl Equation (LDP). As a consequence, our regularity result leads to the construction of Prandtl layer expansion up to any order."

Our approach is based on an efficient implementation of the SfM learning pipeline using a low parameter neural network architecture on event data. In addition to camera egomotion and a dense depth map, the network estimates pixel-wise independently moving object segmentation and computes per-object 3D translational velocities for moving objects. We also train a shallow network with just 40k parameters, which is able to compute depth and egomotion.   Our EV-IMO dataset features 32 minutes of indoor recording with up to 3 fast moving objects simultaneously in the camera field of view. The objects and the camera are tracked by the VICON motion capture system. By 3D scanning the room and the objects, accurate depth map ground truth and pixel-wise object masks are obtained, which are reliable even in poor lighting conditions and during fast motion. We then train and evaluate our learning pipeline on EV-IMO and demonstrate that our approach far surpasses its rivals and is well suited for scene constrained robotics applications."

While the astrocytic response to excitatory synaptic activity has been extensively studied, how inhibitory activity results to intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ waves remains elusive. In this study, we developed a compartmental astrocytic model that exhibits distinct levels of responsiveness to inhibitory activity. Our model suggested that the astrocytic coverage of inhibitory terminals defines the spatial and temporal scale of their $Ca^{2+}$ elevations. Understanding the interplay between the synaptic pathways and the astrocytic responses will help us identify how astrocytes work independently and cooperatively with neurons, in health and disease."

We define an diffeomorphism invariant biscalar whose coinciding limit gives the expectation value of the $\mathrm{T}\overline{\mathrm{T}}$ operator. We show that this biscalar is a constant in flat spacetime, which reproduces Zamolodchikov's result in 2004. For spacetimes with non-zero curvature, we show that this is no longer true and the expectation value of the $\mathrm{T}\overline{\mathrm{T}}$ operator depends on both the one-point and two-point functions of the stress-energy tensor."

Starting from the seminal result of Bourgain (2005) on the quintic NLS, we propose a novel approach allowing to prove in a unified framework the persistence of finite and infinite dimensional invariant tori, which are the support of the desired solutions. The persistence result is given through a rather abstract ""counter-term theorem"" `a la Herman, directly in the original elliptic variables without passing to action-angle ones. Our framework allows us to find ""many more"" almost periodic solutions with respect to the existing literature and consider also non-translation invariant PDEs."

To obtain an unequivocal detection of heavy seeds we need to probe mass scales of $\sim 10^{5-6} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at redshift $z \gtrsim 10$. From this theoretical perspective, we review the observational requirements and how they compare with planned/proposed instruments, in the infrared, X-ray and gravitational waves realms. In conclusion, detecting heavy black hole seeds at $z \gtrsim 10$ in the next decade will be challenging but, according to current theoretical models, feasible with upcoming/proposed facilities. Their detection will be fundamental to understand the early history of the Universe, as well as its evolution until now. Shedding light on the dawn of black holes will certainly be one of the key tasks that the astronomical community will focus on in the next decade."

The waveguide terminates at one end and contains unknown obstacles of compact support, to be determined from data gathered by an array of sensors that probe the obstacles with waves and measure the scattered response. The first imaging method, known as the factorization method, is based on the factorization of the far field operator. It is designed to image at single frequency and estimates the support of the obstacles by a Picard range criterion. The second imaging method, known as migration, works either with one or multiple frequencies. It forms an image by backpropagating the measured scattered wave to the search points, using the Green's function in the empty waveguide. We study the connection between these methods with analysis and numerical simulations."

The objective of the optimization problem is to support maximum number of secondary users in downlink transmission with constraints on the total power allocated to users, the rate achieved at secondary users and the interference at the primary nodes. The proposed framework takes into account the imperfect knowledge of the channels between the secondary and the primary nodes and also mitigates the interference caused by the primary users at secondary receivers. In order to solve the underlying NP-hard problem, we propose a three-step algorithm with two alternative schemes for power allocation, namely: equal power and equal rate. In addition, we provide a solution by reducing the problem to an Integer Linear Program (ILP). The performances of equal rate, equal power, and ILP methods are studied in under different constraints."

Analogous to the autonomous linear systems case, we define a new notion of spectral radius that exactly characterizes stability of this system. In particular, (i) when the spectral radius is less than one, we show that the system is asymptotically stable for all trajectories that satisfy the IQCs, and (ii) when the spectral radius is equal to one, we construct an unstable trajectory that satisfies the IQCs. Furthermore, we connect our new definition of the spectral radius to the existing literature on IQCs."

Over the past few decades, ground- and space-based telescope observations have probed the compositions of a wide range of icy objects with primordial and processed surfaces, revealing the presence of numerous volatile ices and organic residues. Although these telescope observations have advanced our understanding of icy bodies beyond Saturn, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of collected datasets are limited by the large heliocentric distances of these far-flung objects. Furthermore, most observations have focused on the visible (VIS, 0.4 - 0.7 microns) and near-infrared (NIR, 0.7 - 2.5 microns), with fewer observations at longer NIR wavelengths (2.5 - 5.0 microns) and in the far to near ultraviolet (UV, 0.1 - 0.4 microns), which represents a critical wavelength region for investigating modification of ices and organics by UV photolysis and charged particle radiolysis. Thus, our understanding of icy bodies beyond Saturn is limited by the capabilities of available facilities, and key questions regarding their surface compositions remain to be explored. Next generation space telescopes (NGSTs) with greater sensitivity and angular resolution in the UV, VIS, and longer NIR are therefore needed to help unveil the surface compositions of icy bodies residing at the fringes of our solar system."

The isomorphisms are given by twisted sums of the components of vector-valued modular forms. Our results generalize work of Bruinier and Bundschuh to the case that the components $F_{\gamma}$ of the vector-valued modular form are antisymmetric in the sense that $F_{\gamma} = -F_{-\gamma}$ for all $\gamma \in A$. As an application, we compute restrictions of Doi-Naganuma lifts of odd weight to components of Hirzebruch-Zagier curves."

Additionally, this study aims to elucidate if a stress-assisted criterion can account for transformations in the so-called strain-induced regime.   Design/methodology/approach: The model is derived by generalising the stress-based criterion of Patel and Cohen (1953), relying on lattice information obtained using the Phenomenological Theory of Martensite Crystallography. Transformation multipliers (cf. plastic multipliers) are introduced, from which the martensite volume fraction evolution ensues. The associated transformation functions provide a variant selection mechanism. Austenite plasticity follows a classical single crystal formulation, to account for transformations in the strain-induced regime. The resulting model is incorporated into a fully-implicit RVE-based computational homogenisation finite element code.   Findings: Results show good agreement with experimental data for a meta-stable austenitic stainless steel. In particular, the transformation locus is well reproduced, even in a material with considerable slip plasticity at the martensite onset, corroborating the hypothesis that an energy-based criterion can account for transformations in both stress-assisted and strain-induced regimes.   Originality/value: A recently developed constitutive model for mechanically induced martensitic transformations is further assessed and validated. Its formulation is fundamentally based on a physical metallurgical mechanism and derived in a thermodynamically consistent way, inheriting a consistent mechanical dissipation. This model draws on a reduced number of phenomenological elements and is a step towards the fully predictive modelling of materials that exhibit such phenomena."

In this paper, we present a vehicle motion planning and control framework, based on Model Predictive Control, accounting for moving obstacles. Measured pedestrian states are fed into a prediction layer which translates each pedestrians' predicted motion into constraints for the MPC problem.   Simulations and experimental validation were performed with simulated crossing pedestrians to show the performance of the framework. Experimental results show that the controller is stable even under significant input delays, while still maintaining very low computational times. In addition, real pedestrian data was used to further validate the developed framework in simulations."

The information detection problem at the receiver side is in general difficult due to the imbalance of decoding complexity and decoding accuracy within conventional methods. Hence, a deep learning based efficient MIMO detection approach is proposed in this paper. In our work, we use a neural network to directly get a mapping function of received signals, channel matrix and transmitted bit streams. Then, we compare the end-to-end approach using deep learning with the conventional methods in possession of perfect channel knowledge and imperfect channel knowledge. Simulation results show that our method presents a better trade-off in the performance for accuracy versus decoding complexity. At the same time, better robustness can be achieved in condition of imperfect channel knowledge compared with conventional algorithms."

Understanding the structure and composition of such matter requires many-body nonperturbative calculations that are currently highly uncertain.Unique constraints on the neutron star matter are provided by gravitational-wave observations aided by numerical relativity simulations. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical conditions of matter and radiation along the merger dynamics. We consider 3 microphysical equation of state models and numerical relativity simulations including an approximate neutrino transport scheme. The neutron star cores collision and their multiple centrifugal bounces heat the initially cold matter to several tens of MeV. Streams of hot matter with initial densities $\sim1-2\rho_0$ move outwards and cool due to decompression and neutrino emission. The merger can result in a neutron star remnant with densities up to $3-5\rho_0$ and temperatures $\sim 50$~MeV. The highest temperatures are confined in an approximately spherical annulus at densities $\sim\rho_0$. Such temperatures favour positron-neutron capture at densities $\sim\rho_0$, thus leading to a neutrino emission dominated by electron antineutrinos. We study the impact of trapped neutrinos on the remnant matter's pressure, electron fraction and temperature and find that it has a negligible effect. Disks around neutron star or black hole remnant are neutron rich and not isentropic, but they differ in size, entropy and lepton fraction depending on the nature of the central object. In presence of a black hole, disks are smaller and mostly transparent to neutrinos; in presence of a massive neutron star, they are more massive, geometrically and optically thick."

More precisely, in the context of Markovian diffusion processes on $\mathbb{R}^d$ we prove in various settings that if we start the process from an initial probability measure satisfying GCB, then at later times GCB holds, and estimates for the constant are provided. Under additional conditions, we show that GCB holds for the unique invariant measure. This gives a semigroup interpolation method to prove Gaussian concentration for measures which are not available in explicit form. We also consider diffusions ""coming down from infinity"" for which we show that, from any starting measure, at positive times, GCB holds. Finally we consider non-Markovian difussion processes with drift of Ornstein Uhlenbeck type, and general bounded predictable variance."

Here we provide a systematic strategy to introduce such defects in mechanical metamaterials. We first present metamaterials that are a mechanical analogue of spin systems with tunable ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, then design an exponential number of frustration-free metamaterials, and finally introduce topological defects by rotating a string of building blocks in these metamaterials. We uncover the distinct mechanical signature of topological defects by experiments and simulations, and leverage this to design complex metamaterials in which we can steer deformations and stresses towards parts of the system. Our work presents a new avenue to systematically include spatial complexity, frustration, and topology in mechanical metamaterials."

Nevertheless, very little is known about their mathematical structure. Here, we investigate the structure of reciprocal best match graphs (RBMGs). In order to abstract from the details of measuring distances, we define reciprocal best matches here as pairwise most closely related leaves in a gene tree, arguing that conceptually this is the notion that is pragmatically approximated by distance- or similarity-based heuristics. We start by showing that a graph $G$ is an RBMG if and only if its quotient graph w.r.t.\ a certain thinness relation is an RBMG. Furthermore, it is necessary and sufficient that all connected components of $G$ are RBMGs. The main result of this contribution is a complete characterization of RBMGs with 3 colors/species that can be checked in polynomial time. For 3 colors, there are three distinct classes of trees that are related to the structure of the phylogenetic trees explaining them. We derive an approach to recognize RBMGs with an arbitrary number of colors; it remains open however, whether a polynomial-time for RBMG recognition exists. In addition, we show that RBMGs that at the same time are cographs (co-RBMGs) can be recognized in polynomial time. Co-RBMGs are characterized in terms of hierarchically colored cographs, a particular class of vertex colored cographs that is introduced here. The (least resolved) trees that explain co-RBMGs can be constructed in polynomial time."

Otherwise, problems can be caused by mistakes or malicious behavior of this admin, or when her computer got compromised, which allows an attacker to abuse the administrator's far-reaching permissions.   Instead, we propose to use a reliable and resilient configuration management process orchestrated by a configuration management system (CMS). This can be achieved by separation of concerns (proposing a configuration vs. authorizing it), employing multi-party authorization (MPA), and enforcing that only authorized configurations can be deployed. This results in a configuration management process that is decentralized on a human, decision-making level, and a technical, device level.   However, due to different opinions or adversarial interference, the result of an MPA process can end in a conflict. This raises the question how such conflicts can be mediated in a better way than just employing majority voting, which is insufficient in certain situations. As an alternative, this paper introduces building blocks of customizable conflict mediation strategies which we integrated into our CMS TANCS . The conflict mediation functionality as well as the initial TANCS implementation run on top of the distributed ledger and smart contract framework Hyperledger Fabric which makes all processes resilient and tamper-resistant."

Specifically, for any given input face image, a conditional generative model was developed to transform an average neutral face, which is calculated from various subjects showing neutral expressions, to an average expressive face with the same expression as the input image. Since the transformed images have the same synthetic ""average"" identity, they differ from each other by only their expressions and thus, can be used for identity-free expression classification. In this work, an end-to-end system was developed to perform expression transformation and expression recognition in the IF-GAN framework. Experimental results on three facial expression datasets have demonstrated that the proposed IF-GAN outperforms the baseline CNN model and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition."

It was soon recognized that a family of complex iridium oxides, as well as ruthenium chloride, with honeycomb structure are magnetic insulators and accommodate essential ingredients of the Kitaev model, due to the interplay of electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. This initiated a race to materialize the Kitaev QSL and to capture the signature of Majorana fermions. In this review, we provide a wide perspective of this rapidly growing field, including theory, materials and experiment. We first summarize the theoretical background of the Kitaev QSL ground state and its materialization using spin-orbital-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 moments. This is followed by an overview of candidate materials and their magnetic properties, including Na$_2$IrO$_3$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$,$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$. Finally, we review the latest exciting progress in the search for the Kitaev QSL. In particular, H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in applied magnetic field show signatures of the QSL state, and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has unusual magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties that are consistent with spin fractionalization."

As many as 60% of people with epilepsy experience focal seizures which originate in a certain brain area and are limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. In focal epilepsy patients, a precise surgical removal of the seizure onset zone can lead to effective seizure control or even a seizure-free outcome. Thus, correct identification of the seizure onset zone is essential. For clinical evaluation purposes, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly used. However, their interpretation is usually done manually by physicians and is time-consuming and error-prone. In this work, we propose an automated epileptic signal classification method based on modern deep learning methods. In contrast to previous approaches, the network is trained directly on the EEG recordings, avoiding hand-crafted feature extraction and selection procedures. This exploits the ability of deep neural networks to detect and extract relevant features automatically, that may be too complex or subtle to be noticed by humans. The proposed network structure is based on a convolutional neural network with residual connections. We demonstrate that our network produces state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark data sets, a data set from Bonn University and the Bern-Barcelona data set. We conclude that modern deep learning approaches can reach state-of-the-art performance on epileptic EEG classification and automated seizure onset zone identification tasks when trained on raw EEG data. This suggests that such approaches have potential for improving clinical practice."

For the first time in this final state, a $\psi(3770)$ signal is seen in the $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectrum, with a statistical significance of $5.2\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s} = 4.42$ GeV. There is also evidence for this resonance at $\sqrt{s}$ = 4.26 and 4.36 GeV with statistical significance of 3.2$\sigma$ and 3.3$\sigma$, respectively. In addition, the Born cross section of $e^{+}e^{-}\to \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\psi(3770)$ is measured. The proposed heavy-quark-spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$, the state $X_{2}(4013)$, is also searched for in the $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectra. No obvious signal is found. The upper limit of the Born cross section of the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to \rho^{0}X_{2}(4013)$ combined with the branching fraction is measured. Also, the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\to D_{1}(2420)\bar{D} + c.c.$ are investigated. The neutral mode with $D_{1}(2420)^{0}\to D^{0}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ is reported with statistical significance of 7.4$\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s} = 4.42$ GeV for the first time, and evidence with statistical significance of 3.2$\sigma$ and 3.3$\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 4.36 and 4.60 GeV is seen, respectively. No evident signal for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to D_{1}(2420)^{0}\bar{D}^{0} + c.c., D_{1}(2420)^{0}\to D^{*+}\pi^{-}$ is reported. Evidence for $e^{+}e^{-}\to D_{1}(2420)^{+}D^{-} +~c.c., D_{1}(2420)^{+}\to D^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ is reported with statistical significance of 3.1$\sigma$ and 3.0$\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 4.36 and 4.42 GeV, respectively."

Subsequently, AlphaZero was developed to play Go, Chess and Shogi. In the literature, the algorithms are explained well. However, AlphaZero contains many parameters, and for neither AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero nor AlphaZero, there is sufficient discussion about how to set parameter values in these algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we choose 12 parameters in AlphaZero and evaluate how these parameters contribute to training. We focus on three objectives~(training loss, time cost and playing strength). For each parameter, we train 3 models using 3 different values~(minimum value, default value, maximum value). We use the game of play 6$\times$6 Othello, on the AlphaZeroGeneral open source re-implementation of AlphaZero. Overall, experimental results show that different values can lead to different training results, proving the importance of such a parameter sweep. We categorize these 12 parameters into time-sensitive parameters and time-friendly parameters. Moreover, through multi-objective analysis, this paper provides an insightful basis for further hyper-parameter optimization."

While most previous studies focus on spherical particles, we develop a direct numerical approach to capture rectangular particles. Our approach uses distributed Lagrange multipliers to enforce rigid-body motion in the solid domain in combination with an immersed boundary method to correctly enforce the no-slip constraint on the solid-fluid interfaces. An important component of our model is an efficient particle collision scheme that prevents overlap between particles of different shapes and allows for the transfer of both translational and angular momentum during particle collision. We verify and validate our numerical method through several benchmark cases. Applied to suspension flow, we test the hypothesize that particle rotations alter the aggregated dynamics of the suspension even if the relative rotational energy of the particles remains small as compared to the translational energy."

First, we process the video to get motion history images (MHIs) and static history images (SHIs) corresponding to an action video based on the use of 3D Motion Trail Model (3DMTM). We then characterize the action video by extracting the Gradient Local Auto-Correlations (GLAC) features from the SHIs and the MHIs. The two sets of features i.e., GLAC features from MHIs and GLAC features from SHIs are concatenated to obtain a representation vector for action. Finally, we perform the classification on all the action samples by using the l2-regularized Collaborative Representation Classifier (l2-CRC) to recognize different human actions in an effective way. We perform evaluation of the proposed method on three action datasets, MSR-Action3D, DHA and UTD-MHAD. Through experimental results, we observe that the proposed method performs superior to other approaches."

Probing the physical properties of galaxies at $z>8$ is challenging due to the inherent faintness of such sources and the limited wavelength coverage available. Thanks to the high $\approx$2-6$\times$ lensing magnification of the multiple images of MACS0647-JD, we can use the sensitive Spitzer/IRAC data to probe the rest-frame optical fluxes of MACS0647-JD and investigate its physical properties including the age and the stellar mass. In deriving Spitzer/IRAC fluxes for MACS0647-JD, great care is taken in coping with the impact of three bright ($\approx$8-16 mag) stars in our field to ensure robust results. Assuming a constant star formation rate, the age, stellar mass, and rest-frame UV slope we estimate for MACS0647-JD based on a stack of the photometry are log$_{10}$(age/yr) = 8.6$^{+0.1}_{-2.1}$, log$_{10}$(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 9.1$^{+0.2}_{-1.4}$, and $\beta = -$1.3$\pm$0.6, respectively. We compare our results with expectations from the EAGLE simulation and find that MACS0647-JD has properties consistent with corresponding to the most massive and rapidly star-forming galaxies in the simulation. We also find that its radius, 105$\pm$28 pc, is a factor of $\approx$2 smaller than the mean size in a separate simulation project DRAGONS. Interestingly enough, the observed size is similar to the small sizes seen in very low-luminosity $z\approx$6-10 galaxies behind lensing clusters."

We propose the ""axis"" algorithm of solidlike particles identification, which makes it possible to isolate different domains and their surfaces as well. Determination of the three-dimensional front velocity is based on its definition implying that there exists a small area of the domain surface propagating along some line perpendicularly to it. The velocity measured in this way is an important characteristic of the plasma crystallization kinetics. It proves to be almost independent of time and the direction of front propagation and amounts to ca. 60--80 micron per second."

The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the Far-UV detected BSS NH 84 was constructed by combining the flux measurements from 4 filters of UVIT, with GALEX, GAIA and other ground-based observations. The SED of NH 84 reveals the presence of a hot companion to the BSS. The temperature and radius of the BSS (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 8000^{+1000}_{-250}$ K, R/R$_\odot = 1.44 \pm 0.05$) derived from Gemini spectra and SED fitting using Kurucz atmospheric models are consistent with each other. The temperature and radius of the hotter companion of NH 84 (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 32,000 \pm 2000$ K, R/R$_\odot = 0.021 \pm 0.007$) derived by fitting Koester WD models to the SED suggest that it is likely to be a hot WD. The radial velocity derived from the spectra along with the proper motion from GAIA DR2 confirms NH 84 to be a kinematic member of the cluster. This is the second detection of a BSS-WD candidate in a GC, and the first in the outskirts of a low density GC. The location of this BSS in NGC 5466 along with its dynamical age supports the mass-transfer pathway for BSS formation in low density environments."

Difficulties arise due to both the physical model and the numerical method chosen for its solution. We consider the 5-equation model of Allaire et al. [1], the 5-equation model of Kapila et al. [2], and the 6-equation model of Saurel et al. [3] as candidate approaches for spherical bubble dynamics, and both MUSCL and WENO interface-capturing methods are implemented and compared. We demonstrate the inadequacy of the traditional 5-equation model of Allaire et al. [1] for spherical bubble collapse problems and explain the corresponding advantages of the augmented model of Kapila et al. [2] for representing this phenomenon. Quantitative comparisons between the augmented 5-equation and 6-equation models for three-dimensional bubble collapse problems demonstrate the versatility of pressure-disequilibrium models. Lastly, the performance of pressure disequilibrium model for representing a three-dimensional spherical bubble collapse for different bubble interior/exterior pressure ratios is evaluated for different numerical methods. Pathologies associated with each factor and their origins are identified and discussed."

Two solutions are proposed in literature to create a nano-communication system, either by using the classical electromagnetic paradigm with Terahertz band, or using the bio-inspired molecular communication. However, Terahertz is suffering from molecular absorption and scattering losses at nano level, and the achievable throughput of molecular communication is very low. In this paper, we propose a new solution to establish a wired nano-communication. Self-assembled actin-based is a new method that takes advantage of actin filaments self-assembly to create a nano wire between a transmitter and a receiver, and use electrons as information carriers. VPython framework is used in this paper to perform stochastic simulations of the nano wire formation. The algorithms used for the simulations are presented. The stability of the constructed nano wire is analyzed, and the error probability is calculated. Self-assembled actin-based method promises a fast and stable nano-communication system with a very high achievable throughput."

We explicitly describe the fibers of this map. From the viewpoint of matroid theory, the tropical Stiefel map defines a generalization of transversal matroids in the valuated context, and our results are the valuated generalizations of theorems of Brualdi and Dinolt, Mason and others on the set of all set families that present a given transversal matroid. We show that a connected valuated matroid is transversal if and only if all of its connected initial matroids are. The duals of our results describe complete stable intersections via valuated strict gammoids."

Opinion spammers manipulate reviews, affecting the overall perception of the service. A key challenge in detecting opinion spam is obtaining ground truth. Though there exists a large set of reviews online, only a few of them have been labeled spam or non-spam. In this paper, we propose spamGAN, a generative adversarial network which relies on limited set of labeled data as well as unlabeled data for opinion spam detection. spamGAN improves the state-of-the-art GAN based techniques for text classification. Experiments on TripAdvisor dataset show that spamGAN outperforms existing spam detection techniques when limited labeled data is used. Apart from detecting spam reviews, spamGAN can also generate reviews with reasonable perplexity."

Through the comparison of fluorescence signals in linear and sublinear regimes at different excitation powers, we extract the efficiency of the annihilation processes using conventional confocal microscopy. Spatial images of the annihilation rate of the excitons have resolution beyond the diffraction limit. We investigate excitation power dependence of the annihilation processes by experiment and Monte Carlo simulation, and the resolution improvement of the annihilation images can be quantitatively explained by the superlinearity of the annihilation process. We have also developed another method in which the cubic dependence of the annihilation rate on exciton density is utilized to achieve further sharpening of single nanotube images."

Recommender systems, feature selection, and data summarization are among many applications of this. In this paper, we consider this problem as an optimization problem that seeks to maximize the sum of a sum-sum diversity function and a non-negative monotone submodular function. The diversity function addresses the redundancy, and the submodular function controls the predictive quality. We consider the problem in big data settings (in other words, distributed and streaming settings) where the data cannot be stored on a single machine or the process time is too high for a single machine. We show that a greedy algorithm achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal solution in these settings. Moreover, we formulate the multi-label feature selection problem as such an optimization problem. This formulation combined with our algorithm leads to the first distributed multi-label feature selection method. We compare the performance of this method with centralized multi-label feature selection methods in the literature, and we show that its performance is comparable or in some cases is even better than current centralized multi-label feature selection methods."

We describe the first fully dynamic data structures with sublinear amortized update time for maintaining (i) the number of vertices or the volume of the convex hull of a 3D point set, (ii) the largest empty circle for a 2D point set, (iii) the Hausdorff distance between two 2D point sets, (iv) the discrete 1-center of a 2D point set, (v)the number of maximal (i.e., skyline) points in a 3D point set. The update times are near $n^{11/12}$ for (i) and (ii), $n^{7/8}$ for (iii) and (iv), and $n^{2/3}$ for (v). Previously, sublinear bounds were known only for restricted `semi-online' settings [Chan, SODA 2002].   2. We slightly improve previous fully dynamic data structures for answering extreme point queries for the convex hull of a 3D point set and nearest neighbor search for a 2D point set. The query time is $O(\log^2n)$, and the amortized update time is $O(\log^4n)$ instead of $O(\log^5n)$ [Chan, SODA 2006; Kaplan et al., SODA 2017].   3. We also improve previous fully dynamic data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest pair between two 2D point sets and the diameter of a 2D point set.

The numerical results for $F_{iN}^{EM}(x,Q^2)$ are obtained using Martin, Motylinski, Harland-Lang, Thorne (MMHT) 2014 NLO and NNLO nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs). The dynamical HT correction has been included following the renormalon approach as well as the phenomenological approach and the kinematical HT effect is incorporated using the works of Schienbein et al. These nucleon structure functions have been used as an input to calculate the nuclear structure functions $F_{iA}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$.   In a nucleus, the nuclear corrections arise because of the Fermi motion, binding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic contribution, shadowing and antishadowing effects. These nuclear corrections are taken into account in the numerical calculations to obtain the nuclear structure functions $F_{iA}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$, for the various nuclear targets like $^{12}C$, $^{27}Al$, $^{56}Fe$, $^{64}Cu$, $^{118}Sn$, $^{197}Au$ and $^{208}Pb$ which are of experimental interest.   The effect of isoscalarity correction for nonisoscalar nuclear targets has also been studied.   The results for the $F_{iA}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$ are compared with nCTEQ nuclear PDFs parameterization as well as with the experimental results from JLab, SLAC and NMC in the kinematic region of $0.1 \le x \le 0.8$ for several nuclei."

To that end, we first investigate the literature to collect, summarize and label recurrently-used fix patterns. Based on the investigation, we build TBar, a straightforward APR tool that systematically attempts to apply these fix patterns to program bugs. We thoroughly evaluate TBar on the Defects4J benchmark. In particular, we assess the actual qualitative and quantitative diversity of fix patterns, as well as their effectiveness in yielding plausible or correct patches. Eventually, we find that, assuming a perfect fault localization, TBar correctly/plausibly fixes 74/101 bugs. Replicating a standard and practical pipeline of APR assessment, we demonstrate that TBar correctly fixes 43 bugs from Defects4J, an unprecedented performance in the literature (including all approaches, i.e., template-based, stochastic mutation-based or synthesis-based APR)."

However, extracting data from videos is often challenging. Nevertheless, it has been recently demonstrated that accurate and precise estimates of density for animals (whose normal activities are restricted to a bounded area or home range) can be obtained from counts averaged across a relatively low number of video frames. The method, however, requires that individual detectability (PID, the probability of detecting a given animal provided that it is actually within the area surveyed by a camera) has to be known. Here we propose a Bayesian implementation for estimating PID after combining counts from cameras with counts from any reference method. The proposed framework was demonstrated using Serranus scriba as a case-study, a widely distributed and resident coastal fish. Density and PID were calculated after combining fish counts from unbaited remote underwater video (RUV) and underwater visual censuses (UVC) as reference method. The relevance of the proposed framework is that after estimating PID, fish density can be estimated accurately and precisely at the UVC scale (or at the scale of the preferred reference method) using RUV only. This key statement has been extensively demonstrated using computer simulations yielded by real empirical data. Finally, we provide a simulation tool-kit for comparing the expected precision attainable for different sampling effort and for species with different levels of PID. Overall, the proposed method may contribute to substantially enlarge the spatio-temporal scope of density monitoring programs for many resident fish."

This representation consists of a finite sum and an integral over a universal contour (i.e. independent of the particular polynomials considered within the Appell family). We illustrate our method by studying the zero attractors for rescaled Appell polynomials. We also discuss the asymptotics to arbitrary order of the rescaled Bernoulli polynomials.

This \emph{general quantum variables} construction provides a succinct language for formulating many results in quantum computation and information so that they are applicable in all dimensions. The structures included within this formalism include: a generalization to arbitrary dimension of the three Pauli operators, and the associated mutually unbiased bases; the Pauli and Clifford groups; many important quantum gates; standard sets of generators for the Clifford group; and simple universal gate sets. This formalism provides a convenient, intuitive and extensible language for easily generalizing results that were originally derived for a single type of system (often qubits or quantum continuous variables), and that rely on only those structures listed above, to apply in all dimensions."

Detection of the spontaneous emission of positrons would be the direct evidence of this fundamental phenomenon. However, the spontaneously produced particles are indistinguishable from the dynamical background in the positron spectra. We show that the vacuum decay can nevertheless be observed via impact-sensitive measurements of pair-production probabilities. Possibility of such observation is demonstrated using numerical calculations of pair production in low-energy collisions of heavy nuclei."

Given the relaxation behavior of individual supercooled liquids, the model predicts the relaxation times of their mixtures as temperature is decreased. The model is based on dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics, which provides a physical basis for relaxation and vitrification of a supercooled liquid. This is in contrast to empirical linear interpolations such as the Gordon-Taylor equation typically used to predict glass transition temperatures of liquid mixtures. To understand the behavior of supercooled liquid mixtures we consider a multi-component variant of the kinetically constrained East model in which components have a different energy scale and can also diffuse when locally mobile regions, i.e., excitations, are present. Using a variational approach we determine an effective single component model with a single effective energy scale that best approximates a mixture. When scaled by this single effective energy, we show that experimental relaxation times of many liquid mixtures all collapse onto the 'parabolic law' predicted by dynamical facilitation theory. The model can be used to predict transport properties and glass transition temperatures of mixtures of glassy materials, with implications in atmospheric chemistry, biology, and pharmaceuticals."

Besides the typical scanning tunneling spectroscopy at constant height, we employ two additional spectroscopic methods giving extra sensitivity and qualitative insight into the $k$-vector of the tunneling electrons. Employing this comprehensive set of spectroscopic methods in tandem, we deduce a bandgap of $2.53\pm0.08$ eV for the monolayer. This is close to the predicted values for freestanding MoS$_2$ and larger than is measured for MoS$_2$ on other substrates. Through precise analysis of the `comprehensive' tunneling spectroscopy we also identify critical point energies in the mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ band structures. These compare well with their calculated freestanding equivalents, evidencing the graphene/Ir(111) substrate as an excellent environment upon which to study the many feted electronic phenomena of monolayer MoS$_2$ and similar materials. Additionally, this investigation serves to expand the fledgling field of the comprehensive tunneling spectroscopy technique itself."

The   light and mass profiles,"We have analyzed the parallelism between the properties of galaxy clusters and early-type galaxies (ETGs) by looking at the similarity between their light profiles. We find that the equivalent luminosity profiles of all these systems in the \vfilt\ band, once normalized to the effective radius \re\ and shifted in surface brightness, can be fitted by the S\'ersic's law \Sers\ and superposed with a small scatter ($\le0.3$ mag). By grouping objects in different classes of luminosity, the average profile of each class slightly deviates from the other only in the inner and outer regions (outside $0.1\leq r/R_e\leq 3$), but the range of values of $n$ remains ample for the members of each class, indicating that objects with similar luminosity have quite different shapes. The ""Illustris"" simulation reproduces quite well the luminosity profiles of ETGs, with the exception of in the inner and outer regions where feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei, wet and dry mergers, are at work. The total mass and luminosity of galaxy clusters as well as their light profiles are not well reproduced. By exploiting simulations we have followed the variation of the effective half-light and half-mass radius of ETGs up to $z=0.8$, noting that progenitors are not necessarily smaller in size than current objects. We have also analyzed the projected dark+baryonic and dark-only mass profiles discovering that after a normalization to the half-mass radius, they can be well superposed and fitted by the S\'ersic's law."

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of three basic and key interrelated aspects of a CAV: sensing and communication technologies, human factors, and information-aware controller design. First, different vehicular sensing and communication technologies and their protocol stacks, to provide reliable information to the information-aware CAV controller, are thoroughly discussed. Diverse human factor issues, such as user comfort, preferences, and reliability, to design the CAV systems for mass adaptation are also discussed. Then, different layers of a CAV controller (route planning, driving mode execution, and driving model selection) considering human factors and information through connectivity are reviewed. In addition, critical challenges for the sensing and communication technologies, human factors, and information-aware controller are identified to support the design of a safe and efficient CAV system while considering user acceptance and comfort. Finally, promising future research directions of these three aspects are discussed to overcome existing challenges to realize a safe and operationally efficient CAV."

Despite the wide adoption, few literatures discuss A/B testing with quantile metrics. Quantile metrics, such as 90th percentile page load time, are crucial to A/B testing as many key performance metrics including site speed and service latency are defined as quantiles. However, with LinkedIn's data size, quantile metric A/B testing is extremely challenging because there is no statistically valid and scalable variance estimator for the quantile of dependent samples: the bootstrap estimator is statistically valid, but takes days to compute; the standard asymptotic variance estimate is scalable but results in order-of-magnitude underestimation. In this paper, we present a statistically valid and scalable methodology for A/B testing with quantiles that is fully generalizable to other A/B testing platforms. It achieves over 500 times speed up compared to bootstrap and has only $2\%$ chance to differ from bootstrap estimates. Beyond methodology, we also share the implementation of a data pipeline using this methodology and insights on pipeline optimization."

From a total of $4.12\times10^8$ tagged $\pi^0$ mesons, no signal is observed. Assuming a kinetic-mixing interaction, limits are set on the dark photon coupling to the ordinary photon as a function of the dark photon mass, improving on previous searches in the mass range 60--110 MeV/$c^2$. The present results are interpreted in terms of an upper limit of the branching ratio of the electro-weak decay $\pi^0 \to \gamma \nu \overline{\nu}$, improving the current limit by more than three orders of magnitude."

Stellar masses are computed using a Bayesian Model Averaging method, and are validated for DES data using simulations and COSMOS data. We show that $\mu_\star$ works as a promising mass proxy by comparing our predictions to X-ray measurements. We measure the X-ray temperature-$\mu_\star$ relation for a total of 150 clusters matched between the wide-field DES Year 1 redMaPPer catalogue, and Chandra and XMM archival observations, spanning the redshift range $0.1<z<0.7$. For a scaling relation which is linear in logarithmic space, we find a slope of $\alpha = 0.488\pm0.043$ and a scatter in the X-ray temperature at fixed $\mu_\star$ of $\sigma_{{\rm ln} T_X|\mu_\star}=0.266^{+0.019}_{-0.020}$ for the joint sample. By using the halo mass scaling relations of the X-ray temperature from the Weighing the Giants program, we further derive the $\mu_\star$-conditioned scatter in mass, finding $\sigma_{{\rm ln} M|\mu_\star}=0.26^{+ 0.15}_{- 0.10}$. These results are competitive with well-established cluster mass proxies used for cosmological analyses, showing that $\mu_\star$ can be used as a reliable and physically motivated mass proxy to derive cosmological constraints."

In this way, CMPC anticipates events that might take place, instead of reacting when emergencies occur. We accomplish this by adding an additional prediction horizon in parallel to the classical receding MPC horizon. The contingency horizon is constrained to maintain a feasible avoidance solution; as such, CMPC is selectively robust to this emergency while tracking the desired path as closely as possible. After defining the framework mathematically, we demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally by comparing its performance to a state-of-the-art deterministic MPC. The controllers drive an automated research platform through a left-hand turn which may be covered by ice. Contingency MPC prepares for the potential loss of friction by purposefully and intuitively deviating from the prescribed path to approach the turn more conservatively; this deviation significantly mitigates the consequence of encountering ice."

This concept breaks down in one dimension due to strong Coulomb interactions. There, low-energy electronic excitations are expected to be bosonic collective modes, which fractionalize into independent spin and charge density waves. Experimental research on one-dimensional metals is still hampered by their difficult realization, their limited accessibility to measurements, and by competing or obscuring effects such as Peierls distortions or zero bias anomalies. Here we overcome these difficulties by constructing a well-isolated, one-dimensional metal of finite length present in MoS$_2$ mirror twin boundaries. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we measure the single-particle density of the interacting electron system as a function of energy and position in the 1D box. Comparison to theoretical modeling provides unambiguous evidence that we are observing spin-charge separation in real space."

To demonstrate the feasibility of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future gravitational wave observatory in space, the LISA Pathfinder satellite was launched on December, 3rd 2015. Measurements of the spurious forces accelerating an otherwise free-falling test mass, and detailed investigations of the individual subsystems needed to achieve the free-fall, have been conducted throughout the mission. This overview article starts with the purpose and aim of the mission, explains satellite hardware and mission operations and ends with a summary of selected important results and an outlook towards LISA. From the LISA Pathfinder experience, we can conclude that the proposed LISA mission is feasible."

In this context, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells effectively convert solar energy directly to H2 fuel by water photoelectrolysis, thereby monolitically combining the functions of both light harvesting and electrolysis. In such devices, photocathodes and photoanodes carry out hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Here, we focus on photocathodes for HER, traditionally based on metal oxides, III-V group and II-VI group semiconductors, Si and copper-based chalcogenides as photoactive material. Recently, carbon-based materials have emerged as reliable alternatives to the aforementioned materials. Here, we provide a perspective on carbon-based photocathodes, critically analysing recent research progresses and outlining the major guidelines for the development of efficient and stable photocathode architectures. In particular, we discuss the functional role of charge-selective and protective layers, which enhance both the efficiency and the durability of the photocathodes. We afford an in-depth evaluation of the state-of-the-art fabrication of photocathodes through scalable, high-troughput, cost-effective methods. The most critical issues regarding the recently developed light-trapping nanostructured architectures are also addressed. Finally, we analyse the key challenges on future research directions in terms of the potential performance and manufacturability of photocathodes."

The principal object of our investigation is the expectation of the matrix of overlaps between the left and the right eigenvectors for the complex $N\times N$ Ginibre ensemble, conditional on an arbitrary number $k=1,2,\ldots$ of complex eigenvalues.These objects provide the simplest generalisation of the expectations of the diagonal overlap ($k=1$) and the off-diagonal overlap ($k=2$) considered originally by Chalker and Mehlig. They also appear naturally in the problem of joint evolution of eigenvectors and eigenvalues for Brownian motions with values in complex matrices studied by the Krakow school.   We find that these expectations possess a determinantal structure, where the relevant kernels can be expressed in terms of certain orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane. Moreover, the kernels admit a rather tractable expression for all $N \geq 2$. This result enables a fairly straightforward calculation of the conditional expectation of the overlap matrix in the local bulk and edge scaling limits as well as the proof of the exact algebraic decay and asymptotic factorisation of these expectations in the bulk."

Most existing studies simply consider distinct subgraphs as motifs and use only their numbers to characterize the underlying network. Although such statistics can be used to describe a network model, or even to design some network algorithms, the role of subgraphs in such applications can be further explored so as to improve the results. In this paper, the concept of subgraph network (SGN) is introduced and then applied to network models, with algorithms designed for constructing the 1st-order and 2nd-order SGNs, which can be easily extended to build higher-order ones. Furthermore, these SGNs are used to expand the structural feature space of the underlying network, beneficial for network classification. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the network classification model based on the structural features of the original network together with the 1st-order and 2nd-order SGNs always performs the best as compared to the models based only on one or two of such networks. In other words, the structural features of SGNs can complement that of the original network for better network classification, regardless of the feature extraction method used, such as the handcrafted, network embedding and kernel-based methods."

We present a comprehensive study of this SN including the analysis of high-quality optical photometry and spectroscopy covering the very early epochs up to the nebular phase, as well as near-UV and near-infrared spectra, and early-time X-ray and radio data. The combined data of SNe 2017eaw and 2004et allow us to get an improved distance to the host galaxy, NGC 6946, as $D \sim 6.85$ $\pm 0.63$ Mpc; this fits in recent independent results on the distance of the host and disfavors the previously derived (30% shorter) distances based on SN 2004et. From modeling the nebular spectra and the quasi-bolometric light curve, we estimate the progenitor mass and some basic physical parameters for the explosion and the ejecta. Our results agree well with previous reports on a RSG progenitor star with a mass of $\sim15-16$ M$_\odot$. Our estimation on the pre-explosion mass-loss rate ($\dot{M} \sim3 \times 10^{-7} -$ $1\times 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) agrees well with previous results based on the opacity of the dust shell enshrouding the progenitor, but it is orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates based on general light-curve modeling of Type II-P SNe. Combining late-time optical and mid-infrared data, a clear excess at 4.5 $\mu$m can be seen, supporting the previous statements on the (moderate) dust formation in the vicinity of SN 2017eaw."

We calculate the system parameters to quantify the curvature-induced frequency asymmetry up to GHz orders, and the changes on the asymmetry up to the same GHz range when a magnetic field {\mu}0|Hz| < 60 mT is applied along the large nanotube axis. Moreover, we show the feasibility of the CPWs to excite higher order SW modes with wavelengths down to few hundred of nanometers, which could be used to encode information not only in the longitudinal SW phase but also in the azimuthal one, therefore paving the way towards technologies that increases the density and fidelity of information transfer, as well as for encouraging technological development of 3D magnonic devices."

We are able to resolve spin-dependent quasiparticle tunneling as well as two-particle tunneling involving Cooper pairs.

We show that the microscopic optical forces exerted on a metasurface by a high power laser (100 GW) can be engineered to achieve passive self-stabilization, such that it is optically trapped inside the drive beam, and self-corrects against angular and lateral perturbations. The metasurfaces we study consist of a patchwork of beam-steering elements that reflect light at different angles and efficiencies. These properties are varied for each element across the area of the metasurface, and we use optical force modeling tools to explore the behavior of several metasurfaces with different scattering properties as they interact with beams that have different intensity profiles. Finally, we use full-wave numerical simulation tools to extract the actual optical forces that would be imparted on Si/SiO$_{2}$ metasurfaces consisting of more than 400 elements, and we compare those results to our analytical models. We find that under first-order approximations, there are certain metasurface designs that can propel 'laser-sail'-type spacecraft in a stable manner."

Recently, a solution called twin-field (TF) QKD and its variants have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, most security proofs are complicated, a majority of which could only ensure security against collective attacks. Until now, the full and simple security proof can only be provided with asymptotic resource assumption. Here, we provide a composable finite-key analysis for coherent-state-based TF-QKD with rigorous security proof against general attacks. Furthermore, we develop the optimal statistical fluctuation analysis method to significantly improve secret key rate in high-loss regime. The results show that coherent-state-based TF-QKD is practical and feasible, with the potential to apply over nearly one thousand kilometers."

The main objective of this paper is to sequentially pose intelligent queries to occupants in order to optimally learn the indoor air temperature values which maximize their satisfaction. Our central hypothesis is that an occupant's preference relation over indoor air temperature can be described using a scalar function of these temperatures, which we call the ""occupant's thermal utility function"". Information about an occupant's preference over these temperatures is available to us through their response to thermal preference queries : ""prefer warmer,"" ""prefer cooler"" and ""satisfied"" which we interpret as statements about the derivative of their utility function, i.e. the utility function is ""increasing"", ""decreasing"" and ""constant"" respectively. We model this hidden utility function using a Gaussian process prior with built-in unimodality constraint, i.e., the utility function has a unique maximum, and we train this model using Bayesian inference. This permits an expected improvement based selection of next preference query to pose to the occupant, which takes into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling from areas which are likely to offer an improvement over current best observation). We use this framework to sequentially design experiments and illustrate its benefits by showing that it requires drastically fewer observations to learn the maximally preferred temperature values as compared to other methods. This framework is an important step towards the development of intelligent HVAC systems which would be able to respond to occupants' personalized thermal comfort needs. In order to encourage the use of our PE framework and ensure reproducibility in results, we publish an implementation of our work named GPPrefElicit as an open-source package in Python."

This extends a result by Nicks for quasiregular mappings, and Rippon and Stallard for transcendental meromorphic functions on the complex plane.

The canonical energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is used in their derivation, allowing the possibility of an antisymmetric contribution when the hadron has intrinsic spin. We show that the asymmetric graviton vertex arising from the canonical EMT satisfies a simpler Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI) than the symmetric graviton vertex of the Belinfante EMT. The necessity of fully dressing the graviton vertex through the relevant Bethe-Salpeter equation is demonstrated for observing both the WTI and a low-energy pion theorem. Lastly, we calculate static moments of the meson EMT decompositions, obtaining predictions for the meson mass radii. We find light cone mass radii of 0.27 fm for the pion, 0.32 fm for the sigma, and 0.39 fm for the rho. For the pion and rho, these are smaller than the light cone charge radii, respectively 0.51 fm and 0.45 fm, while we have a sigma charge radius of zero. Our light cone pion mass radius agrees with a phenomenological extraction from KEKB data."

Here we propose and analyze another such model. We consider a collection of symmetric matrix-valued variables that evolve in such a way as to try to align their eigenvector frames. The phase-locked state is one where the eigenframes all align, and thus the matrices all commute. We analyze the stability of the phase-locked state and show that it is stable. We also analyze a dynamic analog of the twist states arising in the standard Kuramoto model, and show that these twist states are dynamically unstable."

The optical light-curve is characterized by multiple maxima (flares) on top of a slowly evolving light-curve (with a decline time, $t_2>$ 100 d). The maxima correlate with the appearance of new absorption line systems in the optical spectra characterized by increasing radial velocities. We suggest that this is evidence of multiple episodes of mass-ejection with increasing expansion velocities. The line profiles in the optical spectra indicate very low expansion velocities (FWHM $\sim$ 190 km s$^{-1}$), making this nova one of the slowest expanding ever observed, consistent with the slowly evolving light-curve. The evolution of the colors and spectral energy distribution show evidence of decreasing temperatures and increasing effective radii for the pseudo-photosphere during each maximum. The optical and infrared light-curves are consistent with dust formation 125 days post-discovery. We speculate that novae showing several optical maxima have multiple mass-ejection episodes leading to shocks that may drive $\gamma$-ray emission and dust formation."

We introduce a {\em Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)} formulation for MLR subject to regularization constraints on the coefficient vectors. We establish that as the number of training samples grows large, the MIP solution converges to the true coefficient vectors in the absence of noise. Subject to slightly stronger assumptions, we also establish that the MIP identifies the clusters from which the training samples were generated. In the special case where training data come from a single cluster, we establish that the corresponding MIP yields a solution that converges to the true coefficient vector even when training data are perturbed by (martingale difference) noise. We provide a counterexample indicating that in the presence of noise, the MIP may fail to produce the true coefficient vectors for more than one clusters. We also provide numerical results testing the MIP solutions in synthetic examples with noise."

This estimation is a hard problem, and universally good estimators provably do not exist. Kraskov et al. (PRE, 2004) introduced a successful mutual information estimation approach based on the statistics of distances between neighboring data points, which empirically works for a wide class of underlying probability distributions. Here we improve this estimator by (i) expanding its range of applicability, and by providing (ii) a self-consistent way of verifying the absence of bias, (iii) a method for estimation of its variance, and (iv) a criterion for choosing the values of the free parameter of the estimator. We demonstrate the performance of our estimator on synthetic data sets, as well as on neurophysiological and systems biology data sets."

Our galaxies span a wide range of the stellar mass ($10^9$ $M_{\rm \odot}< M_* < 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$) and the velocity dispersion (30 km/s $< \sigma_v <$ 300 km/s). We find that for galaxies with velocity dispersion $\sigma_v>100$ km/s, the density slope has a mean value $\langle \gamma^{\prime} \rangle = 2.24$ and a dispersion $\sigma_{\gamma}=0.22$, almost independent of velocity dispersion. A clear turn over in the $\gamma'-\sigma_v$ relation is present at $\sigma\sim 100$ km/s, below which the density slope decreases rapidly with $\sigma_v$. Our analysis shows that a large fraction of dwarf galaxies (below $M_* = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) have total density slopes shallower than 1, which implies that they may reside in cold dark matter halos with shallow density slopes. We compare our results with that of galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations of EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects, and find all simulations predict shallower density slopes for massive galaxies with high $\sigma_v$. Finally, we explore the dependence of $\gamma'$ on the positions of galaxies in halos, namely centrals vs. satellites, and find that for the same velocity dispersion, the amplitude of $\gamma'$ is higher for satellite galaxies by about 0.1."

In addition to reaping the conventional advantages of caching and massive MIMO, the proposed scheme also exploits the side information provided by cached files for interference cancellation at the receivers. This interference cancellation increases the degrees of freedom available for precoding design. In addition, the power freed by the cache-enabled offloading can benefit the transmissions to the users requesting non-cached files. The resulting performance gains are not possible if caching and massive MIMO are designed separately. We analyze the performance of cache-aided massive MIMO for cache-dependent maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. Lower bounds on the ergodic achievable rates are derived in closed form for MRT and ZF precoding. The ergodic achievable rate of RZF precoding is obtained for the case when the numbers of transmit antennas and users are large but their ratio is fixed. Compared to conventional massive MIMO, the proposed cache-aided massive MIMO scheme achieves a significantly higher ergodic rate especially when the number of users approaches the number of transmit antennas."

We show that the normed trimmed sum process of these observables then converges in mean. This result is new also for the special case of i.i.d. random variables and contrasts the general case where mean convergence might fail even though a strong law of large numbers holds. To illuminate the required mixing condition we give an explicit example of a dynamical system fulfilling a spectral gap property and an observable with regularly varying tails but without the assumed mixing condition such that mean convergence fails.

It can hardly be applied to other learning tasks such as regression trees because extending the BSP-Tree process to a higher dimensional space is nontrivial. This paper is the first attempt to extend the BSP-Tree process to a d-dimensional (d>2) space. We propose to generate a cutting hyperplane, which is assumed to be parallel to d-2 dimensions, to cut each node in the d-dimensional BSP-tree. By designing a subtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions, the extended BSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property from the original version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model, which is named the BSP-Forest, is further developed for regression tasks. Thanks to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly reduce the geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its counterpart, the Mondrian Forest, the BSP-Forest can achieve similar performance with fewer cuts due to its flexibility. The BSP-Forest also outperforms other (Bayesian) regression forests on a number of real-world data sets."

Despite the non-convexity and exponentially many saddle points induced by the change-of-variable, we show that under certain conditions, this over-parametrization leads to implicit regularization: if we directly apply gradient descent to the residual sum of squares with sufficiently small initial values, then under proper early stopping rule, the iterates converge to a nearly sparse rate-optimal solution with relatively better accuracy than explicit regularized approaches. In particular, the resulting estimator does not suffer from extra bias due to explicit penalties, and can achieve the parametric root-$n$ rate (independent of the dimension) under proper conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio. We perform simulations to compare our methods with high dimensional linear regression with explicit regularizations. Our results illustrate advantages of using implicit regularization via gradient descent after over-parametrization in sparse vector estimation."

The standard c-plane crystallographic orientation is considered for wells absorbing in the SWIR and MIR spectral regions, whereas the FIR structures are grown along the nonpolar m-axis. In all cases, we compare the characteristics of Ge-doped and Si-doped samples with the same design and various doping levels. The use of Ge appears to improve the mosaicity of the highly lattice-mismatched GaN/AlN heterostructures. However, when reducing the lattice mismatch, the mosaicity is rather determined by the substrate and does not show any dependence on the dopant nature or concentration. From the optical point of view, by increasing the dopant density, we observe a blueshift of the photoluminescence in polar samples due to the screening of the internal electric field by free carriers. In the ISB absorption, on the other hand, there is a systematic improvement of the linewidth when using Ge as a dopant for high doping levels, whatever the spectral region under consideration (i.e. different QW size, barrier composition and crystallographic orientation)."

In this article, we first carry out detailed signal and distortion modeling in broadband multi-user hybrid MIMO systems, with a bank of nonlinear PAs in each subarray, while also take the inevitable crosstalk between the antenna/PA branches into account. Building on the derived models, we then propose an efficient closed-loop (CL) digital predistortion (DPD) solution that requires only a single-input DPD unit per transmit chain or subarray, despite crosstalk, providing substantial complexity-benefit compared to the state-of-the art multi-dimensional DPD solutions. We show that under spatially correlated multipath propagation, each DPD unit can provide linearization towards every intended user, or more generally, towards all spatial directions where coherent propagation is taking place, and that the proposed CL DPD system is robust against crosstalk}. Extensive numerical results building on practical measurement-based mmWave PA models are provided, demonstrating and verifying the excellent linearization performance of the proposed DPD system in different evaluation scenarios."

To be compatible with Semay's quantum n-body result, this letter reports a conjecture which had not be included in author's early publication \cite{sun2018} but formulated in the author's research memo. The new conjecture for quantum N-body system is proposed as follows: $T_q|E_q|^{3/2}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}} G\left[\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=i+1}^Nm_im_j\right)^3}{\sum_{k=1}^N m_k}\right]^{1/2}$.

Here e.g. hand-sorting of medium value scrap is labor intensive and requires experienced and skilled workers. On the one hand, they have to be highly concentrated for making proper readings and analyses of the material, but on the other hand, this work is monotonous. Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed for a quick and reliable automated identification of alloys in the recycling industry, while the mere scrap handling is regarded to be left in the hands of the workers. To this end, a set of twelve tool and high-speed steels from the field were selected to be identified by their spectrum induced by electric arcs. For data acquisition, the optical emission spectrometer Thorlabs CCS 100 was used. Spectra have been post-processed to be fed into the supervised machine learning algorithm. The development of the machine learning software is conducted according to the steps of the VDI 2221 standard method. For programming Python 3 as well as the python-library sklearn were used. By systematic parameter variation, the appropriate machine learning algorithm was selected and validated. Subsequent validation steps showed that the automated identification process using a machine learning approach and the optical emission spectrometry is applicable, reaching a maximum F1 score of 96.9 %. This performance is as good as the performance of a highly trained worker using visual grinding spark identification. The tests were based on a self-generated set of 600 spectra per single alloy (7,200 spectra in total) which were produced using an industry workshop device."

While much progress has been made to realize thin films of TIs with low bulk carrier density, nanostructures have not yet been reported with similar properties, despite the fact that size confinement should help reduce contributions from bulk carriers. Here we demonstrate that Bi2Se3 nanoribbons, grown by a simple catalyst-free physical-vapour deposition, have inherently low bulk carrier densities, and can be further made bulk-free by size confinement, thus revealing the high mobility topological surface states. Magneto transport and Hall conductance measurements, in single nanoribbons, show that at thicknesses below 30nm the bulk transport is completely suppressed which is supported by self-consistent band-bending calculations. The results highlight the importance of material growth and geometrical confinement to properly exploit the unique properties of the topological surface states."

We present necessary and suficient criteria for the recurrence and transience of the empty configuration of species; we show the existence of a long time limit distribution of species in the system, and present necessary and suficient criteria for the finiteness of the number of species in that distribution.

We employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for approximants of different sizes and determine the local pairing amplitude $\Delta_{i}$ as well its spatial average, $\Delta_{0}$, the superconducting order parameter. Due to the lack of periodicity of the octagonal tiling, the resulting superconducting state is inhomogeneous, but we find no evidence of the superconductivity islands, as observed in disordered systems, with $\Delta_{i}\rightarrow0$ at $T_{c}$ for all sites. In the weak-coupling regime, we find that the superconducting order parameter depends appreciably on the approximant size only if the Fermi energy sits at a pseudogap in the noninteracting density of states, with $\Delta_{0}$ decreasing as the system size increases. These results are in line with the experimental observations for the Al-Zn-Mg quasicrystal, and they suggest that, despite their electronic structure, quasicrystals are prone to display conventional BCS-like superconductivity."

Reverberation mapping (RM) method enables to estimate the distance to the source from the time delay measurement of the emission lines with respect to the continuum, since the time delay depends on the absolute luminosity of the source. This radius-luminosity (RL) relation exhibits a low scatter and it was thus proposed for cosmological purposes. However, in recent years the increase in the studied sample, and in particular the inclusion of highly accreting QSO has increased the dispersion in the RL relation, with many objects showing time delays shorter than the expected. Using H$\beta$ RM measurements for 117 sources with $0.002<z<0.9$ and $41.5<\mathrm{log}~L_{5100}<45.9$, we find a correction for the time delay based on the dimensionless accretion rate considering the virial factor anti-correlated with the FWHM of H$\beta$. This correction decreases the scattering in the accretion parameters compared with the typical value used, which is directly reflected by suppressing the RL relation dispersion. We also confirm the anti-correlation between the excess of variability and the accretion parameters. With this correction we are able to build the Hubble diagram and estimate the cosmological constants $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$, which are consistent with the standard cosmological model at 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Therefore, RM results can be used to constrain cosmological models in the future."

Constraints on desorption temperatures and binding energies of such hydrocarbons are needed for accurate predictions of where these molecules exist in the ice vs. gas-phase during the different stages of star and planet formation. Through a series of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments, we constrain the binding energies of 2 and 3-carbon hydrocarbons (C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ - acetylene, C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ - ethylene, C$_{2}$H$_{6}$ - ethane, C$_{3}$H$_{4}$ - propyne, C$_{3}$H$_{6}$ - propene, and C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ - propane) to 2200-4200 K in the case of pure amorphous ices, to 2400-4400 K on compact amorphous H$_{2}$O, and to 2800-4700 K on porous amorphous H$_{2}$O. The 3-carbon hydrocarbon binding energies are always larger than the 2-carbon hydrocarbon binding energies. Within the 2- and 3-carbon hydrocarbon families, the alkynes (i.e., least-saturated) hydrocarbons exhibit the largest binding energies, while the alkane and alkene binding energies are comparable. Binding energies are $\sim$5-20% higher on water ice substrates compared to pure ices, which is a small increase compared to what has been measured for other volatile molecules such as CO and N$_{2}$. Thus in the case of hydrocarbons, H$_{2}$O has a less pronounced effect on sublimation front locations (i.e., snowlines) in protoplanetary disks."

In this setup, the traditional sparsity assumption on the regression coefficients often fails to hold, and consequently many model selection procedures do not work. To address this challenge, we model the variations of covariates by a factor structure. Specifically, strong correlations among covariates are explained by common factors and the remaining variations are interpreted as idiosyncratic components of each covariate. This leads to a factor-adjusted regression model with both common factors and idiosyncratic components as covariates. We generalize the traditional sparsity assumption accordingly and assume that all common factors but only a small number of idiosyncratic components contribute to the response. A Bayesian procedure with a spike-and-slab prior is then proposed for parameter estimation and model selection. Simulation studies show that our Bayesian method outperforms its lasso analogue, manifests insensitivity to the overestimates of the number of common factors, pays a negligible price in the no correlation case, and scales up well with increasing sample size, dimensionality and sparsity. Numerical results on a real dataset of U.S. bond risk premia and macroeconomic indicators lend strong support to our methodology."

We also reassess the harmful biological impact of UV radiation originating from AGNs, and find that their significance could have been overestimated. Our calculations suggest that neither the positive nor negative ramifications stemming from a hypothetical AGN in the Milky Way are likely to affect putative biospheres in most of our Galaxy. On the other hand, we find that a sizable fraction of all planetary systems in galaxies with either disproportionately massive black holes ($\sim 10^{9-10}\,M_\odot$) or high stellar densities (e.g., compact dwarf galaxies) might be susceptible to both the beneficial and detrimental consequences of AGNs, with the former potentially encompassing a greater spatial extent than the latter."

We perform a full implementation of our protocol, where we successfully validate the physical simulation model against data gathered from the NV hardware. We first observe that our protocol is robust even in a regime of exaggerated losses of classical control messages with only little impact on the performance of the system.We proceed to study the performance of our protocols for 169 distinct simulation scenarios, including tradeoffs between traditional performance metrics such as throughput and the quality of entanglement. Finally, we initiate the study of quantum network scheduling strategies to optimize protocol performance for different use cases."

To this end, we need systems that can understand social relationships in diverse social contexts. Inferring the social context in a given visual scene not only involves recognizing objects, but also demands a more in-depth understanding of the relationships and attributes of the people involved. To achieve this, one computational approach for representing human relationships and attributes is to use an explicit knowledge graph, which allows for high-level reasoning. We introduce a novel end-to-end-trainable neural network that is capable of generating a Social Relationship Graph - a structured, unified representation of social relationships and attributes - from a given input image. Our Social Relationship Graph Generation Network (SRG-GN) is the first to use memory cells like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to iteratively update the social relationship states in a graph using scene and attribute context. The neural network exploits the recurrent connections among the GRUs to implement message passing between nodes and edges in the graph, and results in significant improvement over previous methods for social relationship recognition."

For both versions we investigate their dynamical Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions under an independent stochastic symmetric spin-flip dynamics. While both models have a similar phase transition in the high-intensity regime in equilibrium, we show that they behave differently under time-evolution: The time-evolved soft-core model is Gibbs for small times and loses the Gibbs property for large enough times. By contrast, the time-evolved hard-core model loses the Gibbs property immediately, and for asymmetric intensities, shows a transition back to the Gibbsian regime at a sharp transition time."

At the same time there are a growing number of practical applications, for example robotic systems and driver-less cars, where spoken interfaces, capable of situated dialog, promise many advantages.

As is well known, these assumptions often do not hold in practice, and many authors have studied models for, and the consequences of, the observation times being endogenous in the sense that they depend on the observable process itself. The impetus for the current paper is that the observation times might depend on other features of the observable process than its level, such as its (non-observable) spot-volatility process. In this paper we introduce an estimator of the quadratic covariation between the spot-volatility process and the intensity process of the observation times, both taken to be semimartingales. The estimator we introduce is not limited to estimating the covariation of the spot-volatility and observation time intensity, but applies under mild regularity conditions to the quadratic covariation between any two spot-process semimartingales. We derive a convergence rate for our estimator, and prove a central limit theorem. Both these results apply quite generally to estimators of quadratic (co)variations that are based on rolling and overlapping sums of squared semimartingale increments. We illustrate the use of the estimator by a simulation study, and conduct an empirical analysis of the Apple stock over $21$ trading days. This analysis indicates a rather strong correlation between the spot volatility and the observation times."

We extend available physics-inspired approaches previously applied to 1-D traffic flow on highways and urban streets to support models of traffic coordination in higher dimension airspace for cases where no predefined paths exist. The paper considers airspace as a finite control volume while UAS coordination, treated as continuum deformation, is controlled at the airspace boundaries. By partitioning airspace into planned and unplanned spaces, the paper models nominal coordination in the planned airspace as the solution of a partial differential equation with spatiotemporal parameters. This paper also improves resilience to vehicle failures with a resilient boundary control algorithm to update the geometry of the planned space when UAS problems threaten safe coordination in existing navigable airspace channels. To support UAS coordination at the microscopic level, we propose clustering vehicles based on vehicle performance limits. UAS clusters, with each UAS treated as a particle of a virtual rigid body, use leader-follower containment to acquire the macroscopic desired trajectory."

The term reduced model stems from the fact that the relevant physical quantities depends only on two spatial variables. The additional weak dissipation helps us overcome the ill-posedness of original model. We also prove the global well-posedness of the strong solution to the Voigt $\alpha$-regularization of this model, and establish the convergence of the strong solution of the Voigt $\alpha$-regularized model to the corresponding solution of original model. Furthermore, we derive a criterion for finite-time blow-up of reduced $3D$ primitive geostrophic adjustment model with weak dissipation based on Voigt $\alpha$-regularization."

As found in previous works, the distributions exhibit significant spiral patterns. The $V_{R}$ distributions also show clear quadrupole patterns, which are the consequence of the well-known tilt of the velocity ellipsoid. The observed spiral and quadrupole patterns in the phase space plane vary strongly with radial and azimuthal positions. The phase spirals of $V_{\Phi}$ become more and more relaxed as $R$ increases. The spiral patterns of $V_{\Phi}$ and $V_{R}$ and the quadrupole patterns of $V_{R}$ are strongest at $-2^{\circ} < \Phi < 2^{\circ}$ but negligible at $4^{\circ} < \Phi < 6^{\circ}$ and $-6^{\circ} < \Phi < -4^{\circ}$. Our results suggest an external origin of the phase spirals. In this scenario, the intruder, most likely the previously well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, passed through the Galactic plane in the direction towards either Galactic center or anti-center. The azimuthal variations of the phase spirals also help us constrain the passage duration of the intruder. A detailed model is required to reproduce the observed radial and azimuthal variations of the phase spirals of $V_{\Phi}$ and $V_{R}$."

Nonl. Sci. 27 (2017) 379), it was shown that an initial size distribution with infinite first moment leads to convergence to zero in weak sense, corresponding to unbounded growth of group size. In the present paper we show that for any such initial distribution with a power-law tail, the solution approaches a self-similar spreading form. A one-parameter family of such self-similar solutions exists, with densities that are completely monotone, having power-law behavior in both small and large size regimes, with different exponents."

To find how distributed ledgers solve existing problems, this study looks for blockchain frameworks in the academic world. Identifying the existing frameworks can demonstrate where the interest in the technology exists and where it can be miss-ing. This study encountered several blockchain frameworks in development.

Several approaches have been proposed for this problem, including regression methods, synthetic control methods and matrix completion methods. This paper considers an ensemble approach, and shows that it performs better than any of the individual methods in several economic datasets. Matrix completion methods are often given the most weight by the ensemble, but this clearly depends on the setting. We argue that ensemble methods present a fruitful direction for further research in the causal panel data setting."

We use a suite of cosmological simulations and idealised numerical experiments to show that 2-body scattering is exacerbated in situations where there are two species of unequal mass. This is a consequence of mass segregation and reflects a flow of kinetic energy from the more to less massive particles. This has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy sizes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which nearly always model stars with less massive particles than are used for the dark matter. We compare idealised models as well as simulations from the EAGLE project that differ only in the mass resolution of the dark matter component, but keep sub-grid physics, baryonic mass resolution and gravitational force softening fixed. If the dark matter particle mass exceeds the mass of stellar particles, then galaxy sizes--quantified by their projected half-mass radii, ${\rm R_{50}}$--increase systematically with time until ${\rm R_{50}}$ exceeds a small fraction of the redshift-dependent mean inter-particle separation, $l$ (${\rm R_{50}}\geq 0.05\times l$). Our conclusions should also apply to simulations that adopt different hydrodynamic solvers, subgrid physics or adaptive softening, but in that case may need quantitative revision. Any simulation employing a stellar-to-dark matter particle mass ratio greater than unity will escalate spurious energy transfer from dark matter to baryons on small scales."

The incoherent power is computed by the multi-antenna receiver based on only the spatial variable. In this respect, it is a one-dimensional (1-D) CF, and thereby the image sidelobes in down-range cannot be effectively suppressed. We propose a two-dimensional (2-D) CF by supplementing the 1-D CF by an incoherent sum dealing with the frequency dimension. In essence, we employ both spatial diversity and frequency diversity which, respectively, enhance imaging quality in cross range and range. Simulations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed approach."

However, such information is not available to most retail companies. Several studies have been conducted to predict the demographic attributes of users from their transaction histories, but they have some limitations. First, they focused on parameter sharing to predict all attributes but capturing task-specific features is also important in multi-task learning. Second, they assumed that all transactions are equally important in predicting demographic attributes. However, some transactions are more useful than others for predicting a certain attribute. Furthermore, decision making process of models cannot be interpreted as they work in a black-box manner. To address the limitations, we propose an Embedding Transformation Network with Attention (ETNA) model which shares representations at the bottom of the model structure and transforms them to task-specific representations using a simple linear transformation method. In addition, we can obtain more informative transactions for predicting certain attributes using the attention mechanism. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the previous models on all tasks. In our qualitative analysis, we show the visualization of attention weights, which provides business managers with some useful insights."

This framework allows our model generating abundant high frequency details from sparse input information. We also explore the defects of disentangling style latent space implicitly from images, and demonstrate that explicit color domain in our model performs better on controllability and interpretability. In our experiments, we achieve outstanding results on reconstructing realistic images and translating hand drawn drafts into satisfactory paintings.

Modern high-end FPGAs offer Tera-scale arithmetic performance, and thereby provide a significant amount of operations per data set even for MHz-range data rates. We present a bottom-up approach of implementing typical neural network layers, in which we took both the special constraints that come from high-performance trigger systems, such as the ATLAS hardware trigger at the LHC, as well as an efficient implementation into account. By specifically designing each layer type to match our requirements, we could develop a framework that reaches 90 to 100% processing efficiency for large layers, requires only few extra resources for data flow and controlling, and offers latencies in the range of only tens to hundreds of nanoseconds for entire (deep) networks.

Bilayer graphene (BLG) changes from a superconductor to a semiconductor depending on it's stacking, but because it is difficult to control its stacking, it is not a reliable material for device fabrication. Using DFTB+, this work demonstrates that bilayers of graphenylene, net-C, and net-W can be reliably used for device fabrication without knowing the details of their stackings. Bilayers of graphenylene and net-C are semiconducting for all sheer displacements, net-W is conducting for all sheer displacements, while that Type II, like BLG, is conducting or semiconducting depending on the sheer displacement. The method used gives bond lengths, unit cell dimensions, and band dispersion of single-layer graphene that are consistent with previously reported values, it correctly predicts that AB stacking is the ground state of BLG and gives an interlayer separation that is consistent with previous studies. The bond lengths and lattice constants of the other carbon allotropes are consistent with previously published values. \textcolor{blue}{In order to calculate the band structures the bilayer systems,} DFTB+ was first used to determined the interlayer separations of the 2-D carbon allotropes under shear displacement."

Repeated assessments of the beat frequency when the measurement cavity is evacuated provide conditions under which the methodology is immune to the linear parts of the drifts in the system, both those from length changes of the cavities and those from gas leaks and outgassing. This implies that the technique is solely influenced by the non-linear parts of the drifts. This work provides a description of the principle behind the GAMOR methodology and explicates the background to its unique property. Based on simple models of the drifts of the temperature in the cavity spacer and the residual gas in the reference cavity, this work predicts that a GAMOR system, when used for assessment of refractivity, can sustain significant temperature drifts and leakage rates without being affected by noticeable errors or uncertainties. The cavity spacer can be exposed to temperature fluctuations of 100 mK over 103 s, and the reference cavity can have a leakage that fills it up with gas on a timescale of days, without providing errors or uncertainties in the assessment of refractivity that are 3 x 10^(-12), which, for N2, corresponds to 0.01 ppm (parts per million) of the value under atmospheric pressure conditions, and thereby 1 mPa. Since well-designed systems often have temperature fluctuations and leakage rates that are smaller than these, it is concluded that there will, in practice, not be any appreciable influence from cavity length drifts, gas leaks, and outgassing in the GAMOR methodology."

The motion of the chain-filled damper, recorded by a particle tracing technology, demonstrates that the granular chains can efficiently absorb the collisional energy of the damper. We extract both the restitution coefficient of the first collision and the total flight time to characterize the dissipation ability of the damper. Two containers and three types of granular chains, different in size, stiffness and restitution coefficient, are used to examine the experimental results. We find that the restitution coefficient of the first collision of a single-chain-filled damper can linearly tend to vanish with increasing the chain length and obtain a minimum filling mass required to cease the container at the first collision (no rebound). When the strong impact occurs, the collisional absorption efficiency of a chain-filled damper is superior to a monodisperse-particle-filled damper. Furthermore, the longer the chains are, the better the dissipative effect is."

The primary idea is that leaf disease symptoms appear in the leaf area whereas the background region contains no useful information regarding leaf diseases. To realize this idea, two subnetworks are first designed. One is for the division of the input image into three areas: background, leaf area, and spot area indicating the leaf diseases, which is the region of interest, and the other is for the classification of leaf diseases. The two subnetworks exhibit the architecture types of an encoder-decoder network and VGG network, respectively; subsequently, they are trained separately through transfer learning with a new training set containing class information, according to the types of leaf diseases and the ground truth images where the background, leaf area, and spot area are separated. Next, to connect these subnetworks and subsequently train the connected whole network in an end-to-end manner, the predicted ROI feature map is stacked on the top of the input image through a fusion layer, and subsequently fed into the subnetwork used for the leaf disease identification. The experimental results indicate that correct recognition accuracy can be increased using the predicted ROI feature map. It is also shown that the proposed method obtains better performance than the conventional state-of-the-art methods: transfer-learning-based methods, bilinear model, and multiscale-based deep feature extraction, and pooling approach."

Feature extraction and representation constitutes one the basic building blocks towards answering this question. Traditionally, this has been done with carefully engineered hand-crafted techniques such as HOG, SIFT or ORB. However, there is no ``one size fits all'' approach that satisfies all requirements. In recent years, the rising popularity of deep learning has resulted in a myriad of end-to-end solutions to many computer vision problems. These approaches, while successful, tend to lack scalability and can't easily exploit information learned by other systems. Instead, we propose SAND features, a dedicated deep learning solution to feature extraction capable of providing hierarchical context information. This is achieved by employing sparse relative labels indicating relationships of similarity/dissimilarity between image locations. The nature of these labels results in an almost infinite set of dissimilar examples to choose from. We demonstrate how the selection of negative examples during training can be used to modify the feature space and vary it's properties. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, we apply the proposed features to a multitude of tasks, each requiring different properties. This includes disparity estimation, semantic segmentation, self-localisation and SLAM. In all cases, we show how incorporating SAND features results in better or comparable results to the baseline, whilst requiring little to no additional training.

Conversely, ""invariance-based"" adversarial examples insert changes to the input that leave the model's prediction unaffected despite the underlying input's label having changed.   In this paper, we demonstrate that robustness to perturbation-based adversarial examples is not only insufficient for general robustness, but worse, it can also increase vulnerability of the model to invariance-based adversarial examples. In addition to analytical constructions, we empirically study vision classifiers with state-of-the-art robustness to perturbation-based adversaries constrained by an $\ell_p$ norm. We mount attacks that exploit excessive model invariance in directions relevant to the task, which are able to find adversarial examples within the $\ell_p$ ball. In fact, we find that classifiers trained to be $\ell_p$-norm robust are more vulnerable to invariance-based adversarial examples than their undefended counterparts.   Excessive invariance is not limited to models trained to be robust to perturbation-based $\ell_p$-norm adversaries. In fact, we argue that the term adversarial example is used to capture a series of model limitations, some of which may not have been discovered yet. Accordingly, we call for a set of precise definitions that taxonomize and address each of these shortcomings in learning."

The evolution of the compressibility with carrier density offers insights into the interaction-driven ground state that have not been accessible in prior transport and tunneling studies. From capacitance measurements, we determine chemical potential as a function of carrier density and find the widths of the energy gaps at fractional filling of the moir\'{e} lattice. In the electron-doped regime, we observe unexpectedly large gaps at quarter- and half-filling and strong electron-hole asymmetry. Moreover, we measure a $\mathord{\sim}35\,\textrm{meV}$ mini-bandwidth that is much wider than most theoretical estimates. Finally, we explore the field dependence up to the quantum Hall regime and observe significant differences from transport measurements."
9154,4262,2019-03-25,2019-03-25,physics,2.0,4.0,1903.10520v1,Weight Standardization,"In this paper, we propose Weight Standardization (WS) to accelerate deep network training. WS is targeted at the micro-batch training setting where each GPU typically has only 1-2 images for training. The micro-batch training setting is hard because small batch sizes are not enough for training networks with Batch Normalization (BN), while other normalization methods that do not rely on batch knowledge still have difficulty matching the performances of BN in large-batch training. Our WS ends this problem because when used with Group Normalization and trained with 1 image/GPU, WS is able to match or outperform the performances of BN trained with large batch sizes with only 2 more lines of code. In micro-batch training, WS significantly outperforms other normalization methods. WS achieves these superior results by standardizing the weights in the convolutional layers, which we show is able to smooth the loss landscape by reducing the Lipschitz constants of the loss and the gradients. The effectiveness of WS is verified on many tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, video recognition, semantic segmentation, and point cloud recognition. The code is available here: https://github.com/joe-siyuan-qiao/WeightStandardization."

In many such systems, there is always natural language understanding module that solves intent classification task. This task is complicated because of its case-dependency - every subject area has its own semantic kernel. The state of art approaches for intent classification are different machine learning and deep learning methods that use text vector representations as input. The basic vector representation models such as Bag of words and TF-IDF generate sparse matrixes, which are becoming very big as the amount of input data grows. Modern methods such as word2vec and FastText use neural networks to evaluate word embeddings with fixed dimension size. As we are developing a question-answering system for students and enrollees of the Perm National Research Polytechnic University, we have faced the problem of user's intent detection. The subject area of our system is very specific, that is why there is a lack of training data. This aspect makes intent classification task more challenging for using state of the art deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose an approach of the questions embeddings representation based on calculation of Shannon entropy.The goal of the approach is to produce low dimensional question vectors as neural approaches do and to outperform related methods, described above in condition of small dataset. We evaluate and compare our model with existing ones using logistic regression and dataset that contains questions asked by students and enrollees. The data is labeled into six classes. Experimental comparison of proposed approach and other models revealed that proposed model performed better in the given task."

Meanwhile, research on learning reusable text representations has begun to explore sentence-level texts, with some sentence encoders seeing enthusiastic adoption. Accordingly, we extend the Word Embedding Association Test to measure bias in sentence encoders. We then test several sentence encoders, including state-of-the-art methods such as ELMo and BERT, for the social biases studied in prior work and two important biases that are difficult or impossible to test at the word level. We observe mixed results including suspicious patterns of sensitivity that suggest the test's assumptions may not hold in general. We conclude by proposing directions for future work on measuring bias in sentence encoders."

For the square, our first paper focused on the case where $h$ is large and extended results that were obtained by Pleijel, B\'erard--Helffer, for the problem with a Dirichlet boundary condition. There, we also obtained some general results about the behaviour of the nodal structure (for planar domains) under a small deformation of $h$, where $h$ is positive and not close to $0$. In this second paper, we extend results that were obtained by Helffer--Persson-Sundqvist for the Neumann problem to the case where $h>0$ is small."

Many patients describe a range of triggers for altered bowel consistency and symptoms. However, characterization of the relationship between symptom triggers using bowel diaries is hampered by poor compliance and lack of objective stool consistency measurements.

The ion dynamics is modelled classically. Both axial and planar Doppler laser cooling are modeled using stochastic momentum impulses based on two-level atomic scattering rates. The plasmas being modeled are ultra-cold two-dimensional crystals made up of 100's of ions. We compare Doppler cooled results directly to a previous linear eigenmodes analysis. Agreement in both frequency and mode structure are obtained. Additionally, when Doppler laser cooling is applied, the laser cooled steady state plasma axial temperature agrees with the Doppler cooling limit. Numerical simulations using the approach described and benchmarked here will provide insights into the dynamics of large trapped-ion crystals, improving their performance as a platform for quantum simulation and sensing."

Let $h_2(n)$ denote the largest possible codimension of a cyclically covering subspace of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. We show that $h_2(p)= 2$ for every prime $p$ such that 2 is a primitive root modulo $p$, which, assuming Artin's conjecture, answers a question of Peter Cameron from 1991. We also prove various bounds on $h_2(ab)$ depending on $h_2(a)$ and $h_2(b)$ and extend some of our results to a more general set-up proposed by Cameron, Ellis and Raynaud."

The inverse source problem in this paper is the problem to reconstruct a source term from external observations. Our method to solve this inverse source problem consists of two stages. We first establish an equation of the derivative of the solution to the parabolic equation with respect to the time variable. Then, in the second stage, we solve this equation by the quasi-reversibility method. The inverse source problem considered in this paper is the linearization of a nonlinear coefficient inverse problem. Hence, iteratively solving the inverse source problem provides the numerical solution to that coefficient inverse problem. Numerical results for the inverse source problem under consideration and the corresponding nonlinear coefficient inverse problem are presented."

Here, we present radio follow-up observations of GW170608, a BBH merger that occurred during the second observing run (O2) of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Our radio follow up focused on a specific field contained in the GW170608 sky localization area, where a candidate high-energy transient was detected by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). We make use of data collected at 1.4\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), as well as with the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). Our analysis is sensitive to potential radio afterglows with luminosity densities $L_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}\gtrsim 6\times10^{28}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$\,Hz$^{-1}$. In the most optimistic theoretical models, $\approx 20\%$ of BBH events occurring in massive hosts could be associated with outflows as radio luminous as this. Although we find no evidence for the presence of a radio counterpart associated with the LAT candidate in the GW170608 error region, our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of future radio follow-up observations of well localized BBHs."

Though many STLF methods were proposed over the past decades, most of them focused on loads at high aggregation levels only. Thus, low-aggregation load forecast still requires further research and development. Compared with the substation or city level loads, individual loads are typically more volatile and much more challenging to forecast. To further address this issue, this paper first discusses the characteristics of small-and-medium enterprise (SME) and residential loads at different aggregation levels and quantifies their predictability with approximate entropy. Various STLF techniques, from the conventional linear regression to state-of-the-art deep learning, are implemented for a detailed comparative analysis to verify the forecasting performances as well as the predictability using an Irish smart meter dataset. In addition, the paper also investigates how using data processing improves individual-level residential load forecasting with low predictability. Effectiveness of the discussed method is validated with numerical results."

Our construction extends Wehrheim and Woodward's Floer Field theory, and is inspired by Manolescu and Woodward's construction of symplectic instanton homology. It can be seen, in dimensions $1+1$, as a real analog of a construction by Moore and Tachikawa.   Our construction is motivated by instanton gauge theory in dimensions 3 and 4: we expect to promote $\widehat{\mathcal{H}am}$ to a (sort of) 3-category via equivariant Lagrangian Floer homology, and extend our quasi 2-functor to dimension 4, via equivariant analogues of Donaldson polynomials."

We consider theoretically and experimentally a series of suitable Bell-type inequalities a violation of which is sufficient for the detection of three-way nonlocality. For the generalized GHZ (gGHZ) states, it is demonstrated that they do violate tripartite Bell-type inequalities for any degree of tripartite entanglement even if they do not violate Svetlichny inequality. It implies that three-way entangled gGHZ can always exhibit genuine three-way nonlocality under the requirement of time-order-dependent principle. Furthermore, we have determined the maximal amount of noise admissible for the gGHZ states to still remain genuine three-way nonlocal."

However, most realizations are limited to classical systems and quantum fluctuations of light is unexplored. For the first time, we report the observation of quantum correlations between light channels in an anti-symmetric optical system made of flying atoms. Two distant optical channels coupled dissipatively, display gain, phase sensitivity and quantum correlations with each other, even under linear atom-light interaction within each channel. We found that quantum correlations emerge in the phase unbroken regime and disappears after crossing the exceptional point. Our microscopic model considering quantum noise evolution produces results in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. This work opens up a new direction of experimental quantum nonlinear optics using non-Hermitian systems, and demonstrates the viability of nonlinear coupling with linear systems by using atomic motion as feedback."

While automated systems have been used for a long time, these have mostly been limited to using simple decision automation, such as signal amplitude threshold. The recent advances in various machine learning algorithms have solved many similarly difficult classification problems, that have previously been considered intractable. For non-destructive testing, encouraging results have already been reported in the open literature, but the use of machine learning is still very limited in NDT applications in the field. Key issue hindering their use, is the limited availability of representative flawed data-sets to be used for training. In the present paper, we develop modern, very deep convolutional network to detect flaws from phased-array ultrasonic data. We make extensive use of data augmentation to enhance the initially limited raw data and to aid learning. The data augmentation utilizes virtual flaws - a technique, that has successfully been used in training human inspectors and is soon to be used in nuclear inspection qualification. The results from the machine learning classifier are compared to human performance. We show, that using sophisticated data augmentation, modern deep learning networks can be trained to achieve superhuman performance by significant margin."

Let $Q$ be the unique even positive solution of $Q''+Q^5=Q$. For any $\nu\in (0,\frac 13)$, there exist global (for $t\geq 0$) solutions of the equation with the asymptotic behavior \begin{equation*} u(t,x)= t^{-\frac{\nu}2} Q\left(t^{-\nu} (x-x(t))\right)+w(t,x) \end{equation*} where, for some $c>0$, \begin{equation*} x(t)\sim c t^{1-2\nu} \quad \mbox{and}\quad \|w(t)\|_{H^1(x>\frac 12 x(t))} \to 0\quad \mbox{as $t\to +\infty$.} \end{equation*} Moreover, the initial data for such solutions can be taken arbitrarily close to a solitary wave in the energy space. The long-time flattening of the solitary wave is forced by a slowly decaying tail in the initial data.   This result and its proof are inspired and complement recent blow-up results for the critical generalized KdV equation. This article is also motivated by previous constructions of exotic behaviors close to solitons for other nonlinear dispersive equations such as the energy-critical wave equation."

Thresholding on the value of the pairwise correlation is probably the most straightforward and common method to create a network from a correlation matrix. However, there have been criticisms on this thresholding approach such as an inability to filter out spurious correlations, which have led to proposals of alternative methods to overcome some of the problems. We propose a method to create networks from correlation matrices based on optimisation with regularization, where we lay an edge between each pair of nodes if and only if the edge is unexpected from a null model. The proposed algorithm is advantageous in that it can be combined with different types of null models. Moreover, the algorithm can select the most plausible null model from a set of candidate null models using a model selection criterion. For three economic data sets, we find that the configuration model for correlation matrices is often preferred to standard null models. For country-level product export data, the present method better predicts main products exported from countries than sample correlation matrices do."

However, plasmon resonances in graphene are typically limited to infrared frequencies, below those of optical excitations in robust quantum light sources and many biologically interesting molecules. Here we propose to utilize near fields generated by the plasmon-assisted nonlinear optical response of nanostructured graphene to resonantly couple with proximal quantum emitters operating in the near-infrared. We show that the nonlinear near-field produced by a graphene nanodisk can strongly excite and coherently control quantum states in two- and three-level atomic systems when the third harmonic of its plasmon resonance is tuned to a particular electronic transition. In the present scheme, emitter and plasmon resonances are nondegenerate, circumventing strong enhancement of spontaneous emission.

In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the potential of styles to improve the performance of CNNs in general vision tasks. We propose a Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM), a simple yet effective architectural unit, which adaptively recalibrates intermediate feature maps by exploiting their styles. SRM first extracts the style information from each channel of the feature maps by style pooling, then estimates per-channel recalibration weight via channel-independent style integration. By incorporating the relative importance of individual styles into feature maps, SRM effectively enhances the representational ability of a CNN. The proposed module is directly fed into existing CNN architectures with negligible overhead. We conduct comprehensive experiments on general image recognition as well as tasks related to styles, which verify the benefit of SRM over recent approaches such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE). To explain the inherent difference between SRM and SE, we provide an in-depth comparison of their representational properties."

In this treatise, we conceive a low-complexity concatenated quantum turbo code (QTC) design exhibiting a high quantum coding rate. The high quantum coding rate is achieved by combining the quantum-domain version of short-block codes (SBCs) also known as single parity check (SPC) codes as the outer codes and quantum unity-rate codes (QURCs) as the inner codes. Despite its design simplicity, the proposed QTC yields a near-hashing-bound error correction performance. For instance, compared to the best half-rate QTC known in the literature, namely the QIrCC-QURC scheme, which operates at the distance of $D = 0.037$ from the quantum hashing bound, our novel QSBC-QURC scheme can operate at the distance of $D = 0.029$. It is worth also mentioning that this is the first instantiation of QTCs capable of adjusting the quantum encoders according to the quantum coding rate required for mitigating the Pauli errors given the different depolarizing probabilities of the quantum channel."

Aiming at high degrees of efficiency, these systems are increasingly automated, depending on communication systems. However, this makes these Critical Infrastructures (CI) prone to cyber attacks, resulting in data leaks, reduced performance or even total system failure. Beyond a survey of existing vulnerabilities, we provide an experimental evaluation of targeted uplink jamming against LTE's air interface. Primarily, our implementations of smart attacks on the LTE Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH), the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) as well as on the radio access procedure are outlined and tested. In exploiting the unencrypted resource assignment process, these attacks are able to target and jam specific UE resources, effectively denying uplink access. Evaluation results reveal the criticality of such attacks, severely destabilizing CI, while minimizing attacker exposure. Finally we derive possible mitigations and recommendations for 5G stakeholders, which serve to improve the robustness of mission critical communications and enable the design of resilient next generation mobile networks."

In particular, we discover a non-linear delay-induced exit acceleration due to a non-normal growth phenomenon.

There are multiple reasons for promoting sparsity in the predictive models. By relying on a limited set of input variables the models naturally counteract the overfitting problem ubiquitous in learning from finite sets of training points. Sparse models are cheaper to use for predictions, they usually require lower computational resources and by relying on smaller sets of inputs can possibly reduce costs for data collection and storage. Sparse models can also contribute to better understanding of the investigated phenomenons as they are easier to interpret than full models."

MoEDAL is sensitive to highly ionising objects such as magnetic monopoles or massive (meta-)stable electrically charged particles and we focus on the latter in this paper. Requirements on triggering or reducing the cosmic-ray and cavern background, applied in the ATLAS and CMS analyses for long-lived particles, are not necessary at MoEDAL, due to its completely different detector design and extremely low background. On the other hand, MoEDAL requires slow-moving particles, resulting in sensitivity to massive states with typically small production cross sections. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the sensitivities of MoEDAL versus ATLAS/CMS for various long-lived particles in supersymmetric models, and we seek a scenario where MoEDAL can provide discovery reach complementary to ATLAS and CMS."

The boundaries are of the type relevant in the NAdS${}_2$/NCFT${}_1$ correspondence. We show that the partition functions correspond to the genus expansion of a certain matrix integral. A key fact is that Mirzakhani's recursion relation for Weil-Petersson volumes maps directly onto the Eynard-Orantin ""topological recursion"" formulation of the loop equations for this matrix integral. The matrix integral provides a (non-unique) nonperturbative completion of the genus expansion, sensitive to the underlying discreteness of the matrix eigenvalues. In matrix integral descriptions of noncritical strings, such effects are due to an infinite number of disconnected worldsheets connected to D-branes. In JT gravity, these effects can be reproduced by a sum over an infinite number of disconnected geometries -- a type of D-brane logic applied to spacetime."

Such data allow an extraction of the electric dipole polarizability which provides important constraints parameters of the symmetry energy, which determine the neutron skin thickness and the equation of state (EOS) of neutron-rich matter. Also new insight into the much-debated nature of the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) is obtained. Additionally, the isovector spin-M1 resonance can be studied in heavy nuclei, where only limited experimental information exists so far. Together with much improved results on the isoscalar spin-M1 strength distributions in $N = Z$ nuclei, these data shed new light on the phenomenon of quenching of the nuclear spin response. Using dispersion matching techniques, high energy resolution ($\Delta E/E \leq 10^{-4} \,\,$ full width at half maximum, FWHM) can be achieved in the experiments. In spherical-vibrational nuclei considerable fine structure is observed in the energy region of the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR). A quantitative analysis of the fine structure with wavelet methods provides information on the role of different damping mechanisms contributing to the width of the IVGDR. Furthermore, level densities can be extracted from a fluctuation analysis at excitation energies well above neutron threshold, a region hardly accessible by other means. The combination of the gamma strength function (GSF) extracted from the E1 and M1 strength distributions with the independently derived level density permits novel tests of the Brink-Axel hypothesis underlying all calculations of statistical model reaction cross sections in astrophysical applications in the energy region of the PDR."

We present an algorithm that unifies cross-calibration, self-calibration, and imaging. Being a Bayesian method, that algorithm does not only calculate an estimate of the sky brightness distribution, but also provides an estimate of the joint uncertainty which entails both the uncertainty of the calibration and the one of the actual observation. The algorithm is formulated in the language of information field theory and uses Metric Gaussian Variational Inference (MGVI) as the underlying statistical method. So far only direction-independent antenna-based calibration is considered. This restriction may be released in future work. An implementation of the algorithm is contributed as well."

We focus on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on activity-driven networks with burstiness. By using an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive a closed analytical form for the epidemic threshold for arbitrary activity and inter-event time distributions. We show that, as expected, burstiness lowers the epidemic threshold while its effect on prevalence is twofold. In low-infective systems burstiness raises the average infection probability, while it weakens epidemic spreading for high infectivity. Our results can help clarify the conflicting effects of burstiness reported in the literature. We also discuss the scaling properties at the transition, showing that they are not affected by burstiness."

We obtain Gaussian fluctuations for test functions in $\mathcal{C}\_c^7(\mathbb{R})$ ($\mathcal{C}\_c^2(\mathbb{R})$ for fluctuations around the mean). Furthermore, we provide as a tool a general method inspired from Shcherbina and Johansson to extend the convergence of the bias if there is a bound on the bias of the trace of the resolvent of a random matrix.

Event-driven molecular dynamics is efficient because its Newtonian dynamics equilibrates fluctuations with the speed of sound. Monte Carlo simulation is efficient if performed with correlated position updates in event chains. Here, we combine the core concepts of molecular dynamics and event chains into a new algorithm involving Newtonian event chains.

Can we rely on additive explanations for non-additive models?

For these two theories, our calculations show that the Newtonian gravitational constant $G$ is time-varying and $|\dot{G}/G|=\mathcal{O}(H_0)$ for the general case of cosmological background evolution, which is similar to the results of the Deser-Woodard and Maggiore-Mancarella theories. Therefore, observations about the orbit period of binary star (or star-planet) systems could rule out these theories. One thing worth mentioning is that the nonlocal Gauss-Bonnet gravity gives $\Psi=\Phi$ and a constant $G$ in the de Sitter phase. Our results also highlight the uniqueness of the RT model [M. Maggiore, \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.043008}{Phys. Rev.

Common approaches operate either by reducing the problem to the still images case, facing a significant information loss, or by exploiting inter-sequence temporal dependencies as in Siamese Recurrent Neural Networks or in gait analysis. However, in all cases, the inter-sequences pose/viewpoint misalignment is not considered, and the existing spatial approaches are mostly limited to the still images context. To this end, we propose a novel approach that can exploit more effectively the rich video information, by accounting for the role that the changing pose/viewpoint factor plays in the sequences matching process. Specifically, our approach consists of two components. The first one attempts to complement the original pose-incomplete information carried by the sequences with synthetic GAN-generated images, and fuse their feature vectors into a more discriminative viewpoint-insensitive embedding, namely Weighted Fusion (WF). Another one performs an explicit pose-based alignment of sequence pairs to promote coherent feature matching, namely Weighted-Pose Regulation (WPR). Extensive experiments on two large video-based benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms considerably existing methods."

Due to the breaking of time translational invariance by the inflaton background, the theory includes kinetic mixings among the inflaton and isocurvatons. These mixings give rise to novel new features in the primordial non-Gaussianities of the scalar curvature perturbation. A noteworthy feature is the amplitude of the squeezed bispectrum can grow nearly as $(k_s/k_l)^{-3}$ while oscillating as ${\rm \cos\gamma \log}(k_s/k_l)$, where $k_s/k_l$ is the ratio of the lengths of the short and long wavevectors. Observation of such a shape would provide evidence for the existence of multiple isocurvatons during inflation. In addition, we consider the effects of these non-Gaussianities on large-scale structure."

Surprisingly, several studies have observed that loss gradients from adversarially trained DNNs are visually more interpretable than those from standard DNNs. Although this phenomenon is interesting, there are only few works that have offered an explanation. In this paper, we attempted to bridge this gap between adversarial robustness and gradient interpretability. To this end, we identified that loss gradients from adversarially trained DNNs align better with human perception because adversarial training restricts gradients closer to the image manifold. We then demonstrated that adversarial training causes loss gradients to be quantitatively meaningful. Finally, we showed that under the adversarial training framework, there exists an empirical trade-off between test accuracy and loss gradient interpretability and proposed two potential approaches to resolving this trade-off."

The algorithm extends the one presented in Phys. Rev. B 91 245154 (2015), and inherits its main property: it can reach the infinite time (steady state) limit since the computational cost to compute order $U^n$ is uniform versus time; the computing time increases as $2^n$. The algorithm is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and can be used for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium calculations. It is stable at both small and long real times including in the stationary regime, because of its automatic cancellation of the disconnected Feynman diagrams. We apply this technique to the Anderson quantum impurity model in the quantum dot geometry to obtain the Green's function and self-energy expansion up to order $U^{10}$ at very low temperature. We benchmark our results at weak and intermediate coupling with high precision Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) computations as well as analytical results."

Such neural networks in principle have the capacity to (over)fit any set of labels including pure noise. Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural network models trained via first-order methods continue to predict well on yet unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent overfitting."

They are found exclusively in the Southern polar regions of Mars and believed to be result of multiple repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions. Araneiform troughs get carved by the overpressurized gas rushing underneath a seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current work is an attempt to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns and model their formation mechanism. The dendritic quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they can be described in terms commonly applied to terrestrial rivers. We have adapted and for the first time applied to Martian araneiforms qualitative morphological analysis typically used for terrestrial rivers. We have shown that the large and well-developed araneiforms (with tributary orders larger than 4) closely follow Horton's law of tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls well inside the range of terrestrial rivers. We have implemented a two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that describes formation of dendrite shapes by mathematical probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite shapes to the araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and evaluated their similarity using the morphological analysis of araneiforms. We showed that DLA model can successfully recreate 2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. Modeling the creation of araneiform patterns with DLA leads to better understanding of seasonal processes that create them.

The yield of deuterons is found to be well described by the thermal model. The collision energy, centrality, and transverse momentum dependence of the coalescence parameter $B_2$ are discussed. We find that the values of $B_2$ for anti-deuterons are systematically lower than those for deuterons, indicating that the correlation volume of anti-baryons is larger than that of baryons at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ from 19.6 to 39 GeV. In addition, values of $B_2$ are found to vary with collision energy and show a broad minimum around $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=\ $20 to 40 GeV, which might imply a change of the equation of state of the medium in these collisions."

This paper proposes a machine learning approach for solving the house price prediction problem in the classified advertisements. This study focuses on the Indian real estate market.

Some recent attempts benefiting from Mask R-CNN formulate scene text detection task as an instance segmentation problem and achieve remarkable performance. In this paper, we present a new Mask R-CNN based framework named Pyramid Mask Text Detector (PMTD) to handle the scene text detection. Instead of binary text mask generated by the existing Mask R-CNN based methods, our PMTD performs pixel-level regression under the guidance of location-aware supervision, yielding a more informative soft text mask for each text instance. As for the generation of text boxes, PMTD reinterprets the obtained 2D soft mask into 3D space and introduces a novel plane clustering algorithm to derive the optimal text box on the basis of 3D shape. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed PMTD brings consistent and noticeable gain and clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We derive closed-form expressions for the UL and DL average SEs by considering linear minimum mean squared (LMMSE)-type and element-wise LMMSE-type channel estimation that represent LMMSE and element-wise LMMSE with estimated covariance matrices, respectively. The closed-form expressions of these average SEs are functions of the number of observations used for estimating the spatial covariance matrices of individual and contaminated channels of a target user, and thus enable us to select these key parameters to achieve the desired SE. We present a theoretical analysis of SE behavior for different values of these parameters, followed by simulations, which also demonstrate and validate this behavior. Specifically, we present the SEs computed using estimated covariance matrices and show the accurate agreement between the theoretical and simulated SEs as functions of the number of observations for estimating the covariance matrices of individual and contaminated channels of a user. We also compare these SEs across channel estimation techniques using analytical and simulation studies."

Traditionally, the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) is enabled by maritime satellites. However, satellites are seriously restricted by their high latency and relatively low data rate. As an alternative, shore & island-based base stations (BSs) can be built to extend the coverage of terrestrial networks using fourth-generation (4G), fifth-generation (5G), and beyond 5G services. Unmanned aerial vehicles can also be exploited to serve as aerial maritime BSs. Despite of all these approaches, there are still open issues for an efficient maritime communication network (MCN). For example, due to the complicated electromagnetic propagation environment, the limited geometrically available BS sites, and rigorous service demands from mission-critical applications, conventional communication and networking theories and methods should be tailored for maritime scenarios. Towards this end, we provide a survey on the demand for maritime communications, the state-of-the-art MCNs, and key technologies for enhancing transmission efficiency, extending network coverage, and provisioning maritime-specific services. Future challenges in developing an environment-aware, service-driven, and integrated satellite-air-ground MCN to be smart enough to utilize external auxiliary information, e.g., sea state and atmosphere conditions, are also discussed."

This compound shows two peaks at low magnetic field approximately around 10.7 and 7.3 K due to antiferromagnetic ordering and subsequent spin rearrangement respectively. Investigation of non-linear DC susceptibility reveals a presence of higher order magnetization which results in the development of a new order parameter around 10.7 K. This leads to a lowering of symmetry of the magnetic state. The order parameter increases with decreasing temperature and stabilizes around 7.3 K. Consequently, the symmetry of the magnetic state is preserved below this transition. Heat capacity and resistivity results indicate the presence of a gap opening around 10.7 K on portion of Fermi surface, due to evolution of the Fermi surface. Magnetoresistance behavior and violation of Kohlers rule suggest that the evolution of Fermi surface changes the symmetry of magnetic state. The observation of new order parameter (which is of second order) is also confirmed from the Landau free energy theory."

This technology allows for the minimisation of passive material near the active volume of the TPC and thus is capable to reduce background events originating from radioactive decays or scattering on the material itself. Furthermore, the high and continuous electric resistivity of the foil limits the power dissipation per unit area and minimizes the risks of damages in the case of an electric field breakdown. Replacing the conventional field cage with a resistive plastic film structure called 'shell' decreases the number of components within the TPC and therefore reduces the potential points of failure when operating the detector. A prototype liquid argon (LAr) TPC with such a resistive shell and with a cathode made of the same material was successfully tested for long term operation with electric field values up to about 1.5 kV/cm.

This situation is opposite to that in a normal dynamo, where the flow does work against the Lorentz force. We compute the spectral conversion rates between kinetic and magnetic energies for several magnetic Prandtl numbers and show that normal (forward) dynamo action occurs on large scales over a progressively narrower range of wavenumbers as the magnetic Prandtl number is increased. At higher wavenumbers, reversed dynamo action occurs, i.e., magnetic energy is converted back into kinetic energy at small scales. We demonstrate this in both direct numerical simulations forced by volume stirring and in large eddy simulations of solar convectively driven small-scale dynamos. Low density plasmas such as stellar coronae tend to have large magnetic Prandtl numbers, i.e., the viscosity is large compared with the magnetic diffusivity. The regime in which viscous dissipation dominates over resistive dissipation for large magnetic Prandtl numbers was also previously found in large eddy simulations of the solar corona, i.e., our findings are a more fundamental property of MHD that is not just restricted to dynamos. Viscous energy dissipation is a consequence of positive Lorentz force work, which may partly correspond to particle acceleration in close-to-collisionless plasmas. This is, however, not modeled in the MHD approximation employed. By contrast, resistive energy dissipation on current sheets is expected to be unimportant in stellar coronae."

This occurs through coupling to an adjacent nanoantenna in a specially designed metamolecule, which is pumped by an orthogonal optical field with phase shift. The introduced scheme is a classical counterpart of an effect known in quantum optics as enhancement of the index of refraction (EIR). In contrary to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), where the medium is rendered highly dispersive at the point of zero susceptibility and minimum absorption, in the EIR the system exhibits large susceptibility and low dispersion at the point of zero or negative absorption. The plasmonic analogue of the EIR allows for coherent control over the polarizability and absorption of plasmonic nanoantennas, offering a novel approach to all optical switching and coherent control of transmission, diffraction and polarization conversion properties of plasmonic nanostructures, as well as propagation properties of surface plasmon polaritons on metasurfaces. It may also open up the way for lossless or amplifying propagation of optical waves in zero-index to high refractive index plasmonic metamaterials"

In this review, we detail a set of statistical procedures for inferring the structure of nonlinear coupled dynamical systems (structure learning), which has proved useful in neuroscience research. A key focus here is the comparison of competing models of (ie, hypotheses about) network architectures and implicit coupling functions in terms of their Bayesian model evidence. These methods are collectively referred to as dynamical casual modelling (DCM). We focus on a relatively new approach that is proving remarkably useful; namely, Bayesian model reduction (BMR), which enables rapid evaluation and comparison of models that differ in their network architecture. We illustrate the usefulness of these techniques through modelling neurovascular coupling (cellular pathways linking neuronal and vascular systems), whose function is an active focus of research in neurobiology and the imaging of coupled neuronal systems."

The distribution of Doppler parameter and column density ($b$-$N_{\text{HI}}$ distribution) is sensitive to the temperature density relation $T=T_0 (\rho/\rho_0)^{\gamma-1}$, and previous work has inferred $T_0$ and $\gamma$ by fitting its low-$b$ cutoff. This approach discards the majority of available data, and is susceptible to systematics related to cutoff determination. We present a method that exploits all information encoded in the $b$-$N_{\text{HI}}$ distribution by modeling its entire shape. We apply kernel density estimation to discrete absorption lines to generate model probability density functions, then use principal component decomposition to create an emulator which can be evaluated anywhere in thermal parameter space. We introduce a Bayesian likelihood based on these models enabling parameter inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The method's robustness is tested by applying it to a large grid of thermal history simulations. By conducting 160 mock measurements we establish that our approach delivers unbiased estimates and valid uncertainties for a 2D $(T_0, \gamma)$ measurement. Furthermore, we conduct a pilot study applying this methodology to real observational data at $z=2$. Using 200 absorbers, equivalent in pathlength to a single Ly$\alpha$ forest spectrum, we measure $\log T_0 =4.092^{+0.050}_{-0.055}$ and $\gamma=1.49^{+0.073}_{-0.074}$ in excellent agreement with cutoff fitting determinations using the same data. Our method is far more sensitive than cutoff fitting, enabling measurements of $\log T_0$ and $\gamma$ with precision on $\log T_0$ ($\gamma$) nearly two (three) times higher for current dataset sizes."

More specific possible carriers among PAHs are investigated, namely elongated molecules, which could explain a correlation between the DIB wavelength and the apparent UV resilience of their carriers. We address the case of polyacenes, C4N+2-H2N+4, with N~10-18 fused rectilinear aligned hexagons. Polyacenes are attractive DIB carrier candidates because their high symmetry and large linear size allow them to form regular series of bands in the visible range with strengths larger than most other PAHs, as confirmed by recent laboratory results up to undecacene (C46H26). Those with very strong bands in the DIB spectral domain are just at the limit of stability against UV photodissociation. They are part of the prominent PAH family of interstellar carbon compounds, meaning that only ~10-5 of the total PAH abundance is enough to account for a medium-strength DIB. After summarizing the current knowledge about the properties of polyacenes and recent laboratory results, the likelihood that they might meet the criteria for being carriers of some DIBs is addressed by reviewing the following properties: wavelength and strength of their series of visible bands; interstellar stability and abundances, charge state and hydrogenation; and DIB rotation profiles. No definite inconsistency has been identified that precludes polyacenes from being the carriers of some DIBs with medium or weak strength, including the so-called C2 DIBs. But additional experimental data about long acenes and their visible bands are needed to make robust conclusions"

Recently in [Ma et al., Nature, 2013], Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) was introduced as a technique being capable of simultaneously recovering such quantitative parameters by using a two step procedure: (i) given a probe, a series of magnetization maps are computed and then (ii) matched to (quantitative) parameters with the help of a pre-computed dictionary which is related to the Bloch manifold. In this paper, we first put MRF and its variants into a perspective with optimization and inverse problems to gain mathematical insights concerning identifiability of parameters under noise and interpretation in terms of optimizers. Motivated by the fact that the Bloch manifold is non-convex and that the accuracy of the MRF-type algorithms is limited by the ""discretization size"" of the dictionary, a novel physics-based method for qMRI is proposed. In contrast to the conventional two step method, our model is dictionary-free and is rather governed by a single non-linear equation, which is studied analytically. This non-linear equation is efficiently solved via robustified Newton-type methods. The effectiveness of the new method for noisy and undersampled data is shown both analytically and via extensive numerical examples for which also improvement over MRF and its variants is documented."

Our results refer to energy scales beyond the reach of the low-energy Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and rely on the pseudofermion dynamical theory for integrable models.

While the dynamics of these motions are well characterized, the underlying mechanisms generating most of them are not known. In this paper, we propose comprehensive and detailed mechanisms that can explain the various observed dynamics of the different pharyngeal areas: the dynamics of the pumping muscles - corpus, anterior isthmus, and terminal bulb - and the peristalsis dynamics of the posterior isthmus muscles. While the suggested mechanisms are consistent with all available relevant data, the assumptions on which they are based and the open questions they raise could point at additional interesting research directions on the C. elegans pharynx. We are hoping that appropriate experiments on the nematode will eventually corroborate our results, and improve our understanding of the functioning of the C. elegans pharynx, and possibly of the mammalian digestive system."

The special class of spaces for which these properties are very peculiar is introduced and many examples are given. In particular, for each $p_0, q_0, r_0 \in (1, \infty)$ with $r_0 \geq q_0$ we construct a space $\mathfrak{X}$ for which the associated operator $\mathcal{M}$ is bounded from $L^{p_0,q_0}(\mathfrak{X})$ to $L^{p_0,r}(\mathfrak{X})$ if and only if $r \geq r_0$."

We consider the top RHIC energies and use the model parameters determined in the previous analyses of particle spectra and elliptic flow. Using a direct connection between the spin polarization tensor and thermal vorticity, we reproduce earlier results which indicate a quadrupole structure of the longitudinal component of the polarization three-vector with an opposite sign compared to that found in the experiment. We further use only the spatial components of the thermal vorticity in the laboratory system to define polarization and show that this leads to the correct sign and magnitude of the quadrupole structure. This procedure resembles a non-relativistic connection between the polarization three-vector and vorticity employed in other works. In general, our results bring further evidence that the spin polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions may be not directly related to the thermal vorticity. The additional material explains the construction of the hydrodynamicaly consistent gradients of fluid velocity and temperature in thermal models with the help of the perfect-fluid equations of motion."

In tasks characterized by the presence of training data (such as text classification) it seems logical that the term weighting function should take into account the distribution (as estimated from training data) of the term across the classes of interest. Although `supervised term weighting' approaches that use this intuition have been described before, they have failed to show consistent improvements. In this article we analyse the possible reasons for this failure, and call consolidated assumptions into question. Following this criticism we propose a novel supervised term weighting approach that, instead of relying on any predefined formula, learns a term weighting function optimised on the training set of interest; we dub this approach \emph{Learning to Weight} (LTW). The experiments that we run on several well-known benchmarks, and using different learning methods, show that our method outperforms previous term weighting approaches in text classification."

Electrical detection of acoustically driven spin waves occurs due to spin pumping from YIG to Pt and inverse spin Hall (ISHE) effect in Pt as well as due to electrical response of ZnO piezotransducer. The frequency-field dependences of the resonator frequencies and ISHE voltage $U_{ISHE}$ are correlated with experimental ones observed previously. Their fitting allows to determine some magnetic and magnetoelastic parameters of YIG. The analysis of the YIG film thickness influence on $U_{ISHE}$ gives the possibility to find the optimal thickness for maximal $U_{ISHE}$ value.

But this theory does not explain the hearing extreme quality regarding high frequencies in mammals. So, we propose a bioelectronic pathway (the covert path) that is complementary to the overt path.. We demonstrate experimentally that the tympanum produces piezoelectric potentials isochronous to acoustic vibrations thanks to its collagen fibers and that their amplitude increases along with the frequency and level of the vibrations. This finding supports the existence of an electrical pathway, specialized in transmitting high-frequency sounds, that works in unison with the mechanical pathway. A bio-organic triode, similar to a field effect transistor, is the key mechanism of our hypothesized pathway. We present evidence that any deficiency along this pathway produces hearing impairment. By augmenting the classical theory of sound transmission, our discovery offers new perspectives for research into both normal and pathological audition and may contribute to an understanding of genetic and physiological problems of hearing."

However, neither the mechanism of its generation nor the influence on the underlying spiking dynamics is well understood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of two interacting distant neuronal modules coupled by inter-regional long-range connections. Each neuronal module comprises an excitatory and inhibitory population of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons connected locally with conductance-based synapses. The two modules are coupled reciprocally with delays that represent the long-range conduction time. We applied the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to reduce the spiking dynamics to the corresponding mean field equations as a small set of delay differential equations. Bifurcation analysis on these mean field equations shows inter-regional conduction delay is sufficient to produce CFC via a torus bifurcation. Spike correlation analysis during the CFC revealed that several local clusters exhibit synchronized firing in gamma-band frequencies. These clusters exhibit locally decorrelated firings between the cluster pairs within the same population. In contrast, the clusters exhibit long-range gamma-band cross-covariance between the distant clusters that have similar firing frequency. The interactions of the different gamma frequencies produce a beat leading to population-level CFC. We analyzed spike counts in relation to the phases of the macroscopic fast and slow oscillations and found population spike counts vary with respect to macroscopic phases. Such firing phase preference accompanies a phase window with high spike count and low Fano factor, which is suitable for a population rate code. Our work suggests the inter-regional conduction delay plays a significant role in the emergence of CFC and the underlying spiking dynamics may support long-range communication and neural coding."

A generalization of the T-duality, where the isometry group is non-Abelian, is known as the non-Abelian T-duality, which works well as a solution-generating technique in supergravity. In this paper, we describe the non-Abelian T-duality as a kind of O(D,D) transformation when the isometry group acts without isotropy. We then provide a duality transformation rule for the Ramond-Ramond fields by using the technique of double field theory (DFT). We also study a more general class of solution-generating technique, the Poisson-Lie (PL) T-duality or T-plurality. We describe the PL T-plurality as an O(n,n) transformation and clearly show the covariance of the DFT equations of motion by using the gauged DFT. We further discuss the PL T-plurality with spectator fields, and study an application to the AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ solution. The dilaton puzzle known in the context of the PL T-plurality is resolved with the help of DFT."

We investigate whether acoustic cues in spoken dialogue can be used to identify the importance of individual words to the meaning of a conversation turn. Individuals who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing often rely on real-time captions in live meetings. Word error rate, a traditional metric for evaluating automatic speech recognition, fails to capture that some words are more important for a system to transcribe correctly than others. We present and evaluate neural architectures that use acoustic features for 3-class word importance prediction. Our model performs competitively against state-of-the-art text-based word-importance prediction models, and it demonstrates particular benefits when operating on imperfect ASR output."

A quench of the mixed vacuum produces an excited entangled state, reminiscent of purified thermal equilibrium, whose properties can be studied analytically in the free limit of the individual field theories. The decoupling of different wavelength modes in free field theory prevents true thermalisation but a more subtle difference is that the density operator obtained by a partial trace does not commute with the post-quench Hamiltonian. Generalized thermal behaviour is obtained at late times, in the limit of weak initial mixing or a smooth but rapid quench. More surprisingly, late-time correlation functions of composite operators in the post-quench free field theory share interesting properties with correlators in strongly coupled systems. We propose a holographic interpretation of our result."

Sometimes, combining those two requires substantial changes to program logics: one recent paper is able to verify Report Noisy Max automatically, but it involves a complex verification system using customized program logics and verifiers.   In this paper, we propose a new proof technique, called shadow execution, and embed it into a language called ShadowDP. ShadowDP uses shadow execution to generate proofs of differential privacy with very few programmer annotations and without relying on customized logics and verifiers. In addition to verifying Report Noisy Max, we show that it can verify a new variant of Sparse Vector that reports the gap between some noisy query answers and the noisy threshold. Moreover, ShadowDP reduces the complexity of verification: for all of the algorithms we have evaluated, type checking and verification in total takes at most 3 seconds, while prior work takes minutes on the same algorithms."

It is vital in all kinds of generative models, where we want to be able to interpolate between points in the latent space, or sample from it. Modern generative AutoEncoders (AE) like WAE, SWAE, CWAE add a regularizer to the standard (deterministic) AE, which allows to enforce Gaussian distribution in the latent space. Enforcing different distributions, especially topologically nontrivial, might bring some new interesting possibilities, but this subject seems unexplored so far.   This article proposes a new approach to enforce uniform distribution on d-dimensional torus. We introduce a circular spring loss, which enforces minibatch points to be equally spaced and satisfy cyclic boundary conditions.   As example of application we propose multiple-path morphing. Minimal distance geodesic between two points in uniform distribution on latent space of angles becomes a line, however, torus topology allows us to choose such lines in alternative ways, going through different edges of $[-\pi,\pi]^d$.   Further applications to explore can be for example trying to learn real-life topologically nontrivial spaces of features, like rotations to automatically recognize 2D rotation of an object in picture by training on relative angles, or even 3D rotations by additionally using spherical features - this way morphing should be close to object rotation."

First, all recorded earthquakes during six months after the main shock, 2013 April 9th, in the vicinity of khaki anticline near Shonbe, are relocated with the probabilistic nonlinear method based on Bayesian inference. The synthetic test is done, with the exact distribution of real stations on hand. Thus, the proper value for the parameter that can explicitly affect the error results is calculated to be 0.01. After performing relocation task, 98 relocated events with horizontal errors less than 5 km from all 373 recorded events are taken into account for further analysis of the spatial characteristics of the sequence. In advance, point source inversion is implemented for 21 events greater than 4.5 Mn. Then, supplementary investigations and stability tests are performed for the results of the main shock. Accordingly, we are convinced that the gathered results are reliable enough to be used for the seismotectonic analysis of the region resulting from the sequence. Eventually, the reverse slip vector with substantial left-lateral strike slip component (in some cases) is modeled employing the distribution of inverted centroids and resulting faulting geometry for the chosen events. A southward dip of the probable causative fault is seen, furthermore depth range of the rupture is localized within 8 to 12 km, in the lowermost part of the sedimentary cover."

Here we consider a simple model where all the FRBs have the same spectral index $\alpha$ and rest frame energy $E$ (specified in a fixed band $2128\;{\rm MHz}$ to $2848\;{\rm MHz}$). We find that the constraints on $(\alpha,E)$ depend on the scattering model for pulse broadening in the inter-galactic medium. For no scattering we find that there is a region of parameter space where the predictions are simultaneously consistent with the FRB redshift and fluence distributions at all three telescopes. The allowed $\alpha$ range is bounded by $-6.0\leq \alpha \leq-3.6$ and the allowed $E$ range is bounded by $1.79\times 10^{33}{\rm J} \leq E \leq 5.41\times 10^{33}{\rm J}$.

The compound crystallizes in the CaCo$_2$Al$_8$-type structure, belonging to space group $Pbam$ (No. 55). The temperature dependence specific heat shows a $\lambda$-type anomaly at $T_N$ = 3.3 K, indicating a bulk phase transition probably of antiferromagnetic origin. At the N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$, the entropy approaches the value of 4.66~J/mol.K which is about 0.8Rln(2), where R is the universal gas constant. The analysis of the low temperature specific heat gives $\gamma$ = 46 mJ/mol.K$^2$. The temperature dependence DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ confirms the anomaly at 3.3 K and follows the Curie-Weiss law for temperatures above 50~K, with the calculated effective magnetic moment, $\mu_\mathrm{{eff}}$ = 3.47(2)~$\mu_B$/Pr and Weiss temperature $\theta_p$ = --7.80(1)~K. This effective magnetic moment value is in good agreement with the Hund$^\prime$s rule theoretical free-ion value of 3.58~$\mu_B$ for Pr$^{3+}$. The electrical resistivity data also shows an anomaly at $T_N$ and a broad curvature at intermediate temperatures probably due to crystalline electric field (CEF) effects. The Pr$^{3+}$ in this structure type has a site symmetry of $C_s$ which predicts a CEF splitting of the $J$ = 4 multiplet into 9 singlets and thus rule out in principle the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic order. In this article we discuss the magnetic order in PrRu$_2$Ga$_8$ in line with an induced type of magnetism resulting from the admixture of the lowest CEF level with the first excited state."

First we consider the case where phenotypic variations do not occur, and then we include the effect of heritable phenotypic changes. In the former case the model is formulated in terms of an integrodifferential equation for the phenotype distribution of the individuals of the species, whereas in the latter case the evolution of the phenotype distribution is governed by a non-local parabolic equation whereby a linear diffusion operator captures the presence of phenotypic variations. We prove that the long-time limit of the solution to the integrodifferential equation is unique and given by a measure consisting of a weighted sum of Dirac masses centred at the peaks of the phenotypic fitness landscape. We also derive an explicit formula to compute the weights in front of the Dirac masses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the long-time solution of the non-local parabolic equation exhibits a qualitatively similar behaviour in the asymptotic regime where the diffusion coefficient modelling the rate of phenotypic variations tends to zero. However, we show that the limit measure of the non-local parabolic equation may consist of less Dirac masses, and we provide a sufficient criterion to identify the positions of their centres. Finally, we provide a detailed characterisation of the speed of convergence of the integral of the solution (i.e. the population size) to its long-time limit for both models. Taken together, our results support a more in-depth theoretical understanding of the conditions leading to the emergence of stable phenotypic polymorphism in asexual species."

Depending on the location of the impurities with respect to the hexagonal carbon lattice, the transport properties of the system may become invisible to the impurity due to the symmetry properties of the binding mechanism. This motivates a chemical sensing device since dopants affecting the underlying sublattice symmetry of the pristine graphene nanoribbon introduce scattering. Using the time-dependent Landauer--B{\""u}ttiker formalism, we extend the stationary current-voltage picture to the transient regime, where we observe how the impurity invisibility takes place at sub-picosecond time scales further motivating ultrafast sensor technology. We further characterize time-dependent local charge and current profiles within the nanoribbons, and we identify rearrangements of the current pathways through the nanoribbons due to the impurities. We finally study the behavior of the transients with ac driving which provides another way of identifying the lattice-symmetry breaking caused by the impurities."

An ideal triangulation T of (M, V ) has V as its set of vertices. A branching (T, b) enhances T to a Delta-complex. Branched triangulations of (M, V ) are considered up to the b-transit equivalence generated by isotopy and ideal branched moves which keep V pointwise fixed. We extend a well known connectivity result for naked triangulations by showing that branched ideal triangulations of (M, V) are equivalent to each other. A pre-branching is a system of transverse orientations at the 2-facets of T verifying a certain global constraint; pre-branchings are considered up to a natural pb-transit equivalence. If M is oriented, every branching b induces a pre-branching w(b) and every b-transit induces a pb-transit. The quotient set of pre-branchings up to transit equivalence is far to be trivial; we get some information about it and we characterize the pre-branchings of type w(b). Pre-branched and branched moves are naturally organized in subfamilies which give rise to restricted transit equivalences. In the branching setting we revisit early results about the sliding transit equivalence and outline a conceptually different approach to the branched connectivity and eventually also to the naked one. The basic idea is to point out some structures of differential topological nature which are carried by every branched ideal triangulation, are preserved by the sliding transits and can be modified by the whole branched transits. The non ambiguous transit equivalence already widely studied on pre-branchings lifts to a specialization of the sliding equivalence on branchings; we point out a few specific insights, again in terms of carried structures preserved by the non ambiguous and which can be modified by the whole sliding transits."

Recognising text documents of classes that have never been seen in the learning stage, so-called zero-shot text classification, is therefore difficult and only limited previous works tackled this problem. In this paper, we propose a two-phase framework together with data augmentation and feature augmentation to solve this problem. Four kinds of semantic knowledge (word embeddings, class descriptions, class hierarchy, and a general knowledge graph) are incorporated into the proposed framework to deal with instances of unseen classes effectively. Experimental results show that each and the combination of the two phases achieve the best overall accuracy compared with baselines and recent approaches in classifying real-world texts under the zero-shot scenario."

To alleviate this effect, we propose to leverage a large stream of unlabeled data easily obtainable in the wild. In particular, we design a novel class-incremental learning scheme with (a) a new distillation loss, termed global distillation, (b) a learning strategy to avoid overfitting to the most recent task, and (c) a confidence-based sampling method to effectively leverage unlabeled external data. Our experimental results on various datasets, including CIFAR and ImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over prior methods, particularly when a stream of unlabeled data is accessible: our method shows up to 15.8% higher accuracy and 46.5% less forgetting compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Our density functional theory calculations show that covalent bonds to the surface can change the orientation of the films completely. For thicker films, the effect is limited to the surface only.

The advantages of this energetically favorable layered termination are discussed in the context of the films' technological exploitation in nanoelectronic devices."

We exploit the real-space renormalisation group solution which gives the ground-state wave function in the form of a tree tensor network and provides a manageable recursive expression for the reduced density matrix of the renormalised ground state. Surprisingly, we find that at criticality the entanglement entropy obeys an area law, as opposite to the logarithmic scaling of short-range critical systems and of other non-hierarchical long-range models. We provide also some analytical results in the limit of large and small $\sigma$ that are tested against the numerical solution of the recursive equations."

The study of these theories with the nonperturbative numerical conformal bootstrap is initiated in this work. Bounds for operator dimensions are obtained and they are found to possess sharp kinks in the MN case, suggesting the existence of full-fledged CFTs. In the tetragonal case, no new kinks are found. Estimates for critical exponents are provided for a few cases describing phase transitions in various materials. In two particular MN cases, corresponding to theories with global symmetry groups $O(2)^2\rtimes S_2$ and $O(2)^3\rtimes S_3$, a second kink is found. In the $O(2)^2\rtimes S_2$ case it is argued to be saturated by a CFT that belongs to a new universality class relevant for the structural phase transition of NbO$_2$ and paramagnetic-helimagnetic transitions of the rare-earth metals Ho and Dy. In the $O(2)^3\rtimes S_3$ case it is suggested that the CFT that saturates the second kink belongs to a new universality class relevant for the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition of the rare-earth metal Nd."

This provides off-the-shelf, distribution-independent, ""amplification"" of the amount of data available relative to common-practice estimators.   We illustrate the estimator's practical advantages by comparing it to existing estimators for a wide variety of properties and distributions. In most cases, its performance with $n$ samples is even as good as that of the empirical estimator with $n\log n$ samples, and for essentially all properties, its performance is comparable to that of the best existing estimator designed specifically for that property."

We compute the dielectric permittivity of such semimetals at finite doping, within the random phase approximation. Because of interband coupling, the dielectric screening shows a reduced plasma frequency and an increased spectral weight at small wavevectors, compared to a regular quadratic band. This weakens the effective Coulomb potential, modifying the single-particle self-energy for which we present both analytical and numerical results. At a low carrier density, the quasiparticle properties of this model strongly deviate from that of a single quadratic band. We compare our findings with experimental results for alpha-Sn, HgSe, HgTe, YPtBi and Pr2Ir2O7."

We used the field theory as a lens to view the essential aspects of group motivation and then utilized collaboration personas to analyze the elements of group work.

A 5,000 km lunar orbit was selected to guarantee minimal gravitational perturbations from Earth and lower radio interference. Optimal schemes for data downlink, spacecraft ranging, and power consumption were identified. An optimal mission duration of 1 year was chosen based on science goals, payload complexity, and other factors.

The auxiliary variable, a scalar number, can be defined in terms of the energy functional by a general class of functions, not limited to the square root function adopted in previous approaches. The current method has another remarkable property: the computed values for the generalized auxiliary variable are guaranteed to be positive on the discrete level, regardless of the time step sizes or the external forces. This property of guaranteed positivity is not available in previous approaches. A unified procedure for treating the dissipative governing equations and the generalized auxiliary variable on the discrete level has been presented. The discrete energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme and the positivity of the computed auxiliary variable have been proved for general dissipative systems. The current method, termed gPAV (generalized Positive Auxiliary Variable), requires only the solution of linear algebraic equations within a time step. With appropriate choice of the operator in the algorithm, the resultant linear algebraic systems upon discretization involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices, which only need to be computed once and can be pre-computed. Several specific dissipative systems are studied in relative detail using the gPAV framework. Ample numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the method, and the robustness of the scheme at large time step sizes."

Researchers use various combinations of fixed effects for three-dimensional panels. When one imposes a parsimonious model and the true model is rich, then it incurs mis-specification biases. When one employs a rich model and the true model is parsimonious, then it incurs larger standard errors than necessary. It is therefore useful for researchers to know correct models. In this light, Lu, Miao, and Su (2018) propose methods of model selection. We advance this literature by proposing a method of post-selection inference for regression parameters. Despite our use of the lasso technique as means of model selection, our assumptions allow for many and even all fixed effects to be nonzero. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise than under-fitting fixed effect estimators, is more efficient than over-fitting fixed effect estimators, and allows for as accurate inference as the oracle estimator."

The final RNN state (coined Morton feature) is versatile and can be used in generic 3D tasks on point clouds. In fact, we show how Morton features can be used to significantly improve performance (+3% for 2 popular semantic segmentation algorithms) in the task of semantic segmentation of point clouds on the challenging and large-scale S3DIS dataset. We also show how MortonNet trained on S3DIS transfers well to another large-scale dataset, vKITTI, leading to an improvement over state-of-the-art of 3.8%. Finally, we use Morton features to train a much simpler and more stable model for part segmentation in ShapeNet.

Using a higher-order numerical method is more efficient than increasing the number of low-order computational cells in areas where the solution is smooth, but higher-order approximations cause convective instabilities at discontinuities. In Ocellaris we use slope limiting of discontinuous Galerkin solutions to stabilise finite element simulations of flows with large density jumps, which would otherwise blow up due to Gibbs oscillations resulting from approximating a factor 1000 sharp jump (air to water) by higher-order shape functions.   We have previously shown a slope-limiting procedure for velocity fields that is able to stabilise 2D free-surface simulations running on a single CPU. In this paper our solver is extended to 3D and coupled to an algebraic pressure-correction scheme that retains the exact incompressibility of the direct solution used in the 2D simulations. We have tested the method on a common 3D dam-breaking test case and compared the free-surface evolution and impact pressures to experimental results. We also show how a forcing-zone approach can be used to simulate a surface-piercing vertical cylinder in an infinite wave field. In both cases the free-surface elevation and the forces and pressures compare well with published experiments. The Ocellaris solver is available as an open-source and well-documented program along with the input files needed to replicate the included results (www.ocellaris.org)."

Similarly to financial debt, technical debt requires payment of interest in the form of the additional development effort that could have been avoided if the quick and dirty design choices have not been made. Technical debt applies to all the aspects of software development, spanning from initial requirements analysis to deployment, and software evolution. Technical debt is becoming very popular from scientific and industrial perspectives. In particular, there is an increase in the number of related papers over the years. There is also an increase in the number of related tools and of their adoption in the industry, especially since technical debt is very pricey and therefore needs to be managed. However, techniques to estimate technical debt are inadequate, insufficient since they mostly focus on requirements, code, and test, disregarding key artifacts such as the software architecture and the technologies used by the software at hand. Besides, despite its high relevance, technical debt prediction is one of the least explored aspects of technical debt. To address these shortcomings, it is mandatory that I undertake research to: 1) improve existing techniques to properly estimate technical debt; 2) to determine the extent to which the use of prediction techniques to foresee and therefore avoid technical debt could help companies save money and avoid a potential bankruptcy in the subsequent years. The proposed research can have an important economic impact by helping companies save several millions. It can have a major scientific impact by leading to key findings that will be disseminated through patents, well-established scientific journals and conferences."

However, most of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the relations between images and consider each input image independently. Intuitively, relations between images can help to understand the images and maintain model consistency over related images. In this paper, we consider modeling the image-level relations to generate more informative image representations, and propose ImageGCN, an end-to-end graph convolutional network framework for multi-relational image modeling. We also apply ImageGCN to chest X-ray (CXR) images where rich relational information is available for disease identification. Unlike previous image representation models, ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original pixel features and the features of related images. Besides learning informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for object detection in a weakly supervised manner. The Experimental results on ChestX-ray14 dataset demonstrate that ImageGCN can outperform respective baselines in both disease identification and localization tasks and can achieve comparable and often better results than the state-of-the-art methods."

The intrinsic magnetization of the ordered state permits these unusual and rarely observed manifestations of Onsager's theorem when time reversal symmetry is broken at zero applied field. Here we study two classes of ferromagnetic materials, rare-earth magnets with high intrinsic coercivity and antiferromagnetic pyrochlores with strongly-pinned ferromagnetic layers at domain walls, which both exhibit odd-parity magnetoresistive behavior. The peculiar angular variation of the response with respect to the relative alignments of the magnetization, magnetic field, and current reveal the two underlying microscopic mechanisms: spin-polarization-dependent scattering of a Zeeman-shifted Fermi surface and magnetoresistance driven by the anomalous velocity physics usually associated with the anomalous Hall effect."

In particular, the recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have spatially resolved that the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disks TW\,Hya and HD\,163296 present anomalously low (i.e., $<$2.0) millimeter spectral indices. In some previous works, such anomalously low millimeter spectral indices were considered unphysical and were attributed to measurement errors. The present work clarifies that if the albedo is high and is increasing with frequency, it is possible to reproduce such anomalously low spectral indices when the emission source is optically thick. In addition, to yield lower than 2.0 spectral index at (sub)millimeter bands, the required dust maximum grain size \amax is on the order of 10-100 \micron, which is very well consistent with the previously derived \amax values based on multi-wavelength dust polarimetric observations. In light of this, measuring Stokes I spectral index may also serve as an auxiliary approach for assessing whether the observed dust polarization is mainly due to dust scattering or is due to the aligned dust grains."

Firstly, we compare different classes of Sobolev spaces $H^\sigma_N(K),H^\sigma_D(K)$ and $H^\sigma(K)$, {and observe} a sequence of critical orders of $\sigma$ in our comparison theorem. Secondly, We present a general atomic decomposition theorem of Sobolev spaces $H^\sigma(K)$, where the same critical orders play an important role. At the same time, we provide purely analytic approaches for various Besov type characterizations of Sobolev spaces $H^\sigma(K)$."

State-of-the-art blind light field deblurring methods suffer from several issues such as slow processing, reduced spatial size, and a limited motion blur model. In this work, we address these challenging problems by generating a complex blurry light field dataset and proposing a learning-based deblurring approach. In particular, we model the full 6-degree of freedom (6-DOF) light field camera motion, which is used to create the blurry dataset using a combination of real light fields captured with a Lytro Illum camera, and synthetic light field renderings of 3D scenes. Furthermore, we propose a light field deblurring network that is built with the capability of large receptive fields. We also introduce a simple strategy of angular sampling to train on the large-scale blurry light field effectively. We evaluate our method through both quantitative and qualitative measurements and demonstrate superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method with a massive speedup in execution time. Our method is about 16K times faster than Srinivasan et. al. [22] and can deblur a full-resolution light field in less than 2 seconds."

In our framework, a multi-threaded miner constructs a Block Graph (BG), capturing the object-conflicts relations between SCTs, and stores it in the block. Later, validators re-execute the same SCTs concurrently and deterministically relying on this BG.   A malicious miner can modify the BG to harm the blockchain, e.g., to cause double-spending. To identify malicious miners, we propose Smart Multi-threaded Validator (SMV). Experimental analysis shows that the proposed multi-threaded miner and validator achieve significant performance gains over state-of-the-art SCT execution framework."

A partial solution to the case $n=1$ was previously obtained by Z. Wu in \cite{Wu}. We solve the cases left open there and extend all the results to the setting of arbitrary complex dimension $n$. Our tools involve area methods from harmonic analysis, Carleson measures and Kahane-Khinchine type inequalities, factorization tricks for tent spaces of sequences, as well as techniques and integral estimates related to Hardy and Bergman spaces."

We propose procedures based on data dependent measures (DDM) and make connections with empirical Bayes and penalization methods. The main inference problem is the uncertainty quantification (UQ), but on the way we solve the estimation, DDM-contraction problems, and a weak version of the structure recovery problem. The approach is local in that the quality of the inference procedures is measured by the local quantity, the oracle rate, which is the best trade-off between the approximation error by a projection structure and the complexity of that approximating projection structure. Like in statistical learning settings, we develop distribution-free theory as no particular model is imposed, we only assume certain mild condition on the stochastic part of the projection predictor. We introduce the excessive bias restriction (EBR) under which we establish the local confidence optimality of the constructed confidence ball.   The proposed general framework unifies a very broad class of high-dimensional models and structures, interesting and important on their own right. In the second part, we apply the developed theory and demonstrate how the general results deliver a whole avenue of local and global minimax results (many new ones, some known results from the literature are improved) for particular models and structures as consequences, including white noise model and density estimation with smoothness structure, linear regression and dictionary learning with sparsity structures, biclustering and stochastic block models with clustering structure, covariance matrix estimation with banding and sparsity structures, and many others. Various adaptive minimax results over various scales follow also from our local results."

Recently, displacive phase transitions have been explored within the realm of replacive phase transition in the CVM theoretical framework by viewing displaced atoms as different atomic species, i.e., by converting a freedom of atomic displacement to a configurational freedom. The same methodology is applied to the PPM calculations in this work, and the kinetics of displacive phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phases in ZrO2 are investigated as well as their equilibrium states."

These steps are generally implemented by loops. Internal comments for the loops often describe these intermediary steps, however, unfortunately a very small percentage of code is well documented to help new users/coders. As a result, information at levels of abstraction between the individual statement and the whole method is not leveraged by current source code analyses, as that information is not easily available beyond any internal comments describing the code blocks.   Hence, this project explores the generality of an approach to automatically determine the high level actions of loop constructs. The approach is to mine loop characteristics of a given loop structure over the repository of the Quorum language source code, map it to an (already developed for Java) action identification model, and thus identify the action performed by the specified loop. The results are promising enough to conclude that this approach could be applied to other programming languages too."

In this paper, we propose a sparse tensor additive regression (STAR) that models a scalar response as a flexible nonparametric function of tensor covariates. The proposed model effectively exploits the sparse and low-rank structures in the tensor additive regression. We formulate the parameter estimation as a non-convex optimization problem, and propose an efficient penalized alternating minimization algorithm. We establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the estimator obtained from each iteration of the proposed algorithm, which reveals an interplay between the optimization error and the statistical rate of convergence. We demonstrate the efficacy of STAR through extensive comparative simulation studies, and an application to the click-through-rate prediction in online advertising."

Intersection space (co-)homology is a modified (co-)homology theory extending Poincar\'e Duality to stratified pseudomanifolds. The novelty of our result compared to the de Rham isomorphism given previously by Banagl is, that we indeed have an isomorphism of rings and not just of graded vector spaces. We also provide a proof of the de Rham Theorem for cohomology rings of pairs of smooth manifolds which we use in the proof of our main result."

The focus of this paper is on flame lift-off and re-attachment to the nozzle of a swirl combustor. Using time-resolved experimental measurements, a data-driven approach known as cluster-based reduced order modeling (CROM) is employed to 1) isolate key flow patterns and their sequence during the flame transitions, and 2) formulate a forecasting model to predict the flame instability. The flow patterns isolated by the CROM methodology confirm some of the experimental conclusions about the flame transition mechanism. In particular, CROM highlights the key role of the precessing vortex core (PVC) in the flame detachment process in an unsupervised manner. For the attachment process, strong flow recirculation far from the nozzle appears to drive the flame upstream, thus initiating re-attachment. Different data-types (velocity field, OH concentration) were processed by the modeling tool, and the predictive capabilities of these different models are also compared. It was found that the swirling velocity possesses the best predictive properties, which gives a supplemental argument for the role of the PVC in causing the flame transition. The model is tested against unseen data and successfully predicts the probability of flame transition (both detachment and attachment) when trained with swirling velocity with minimal user input. The model trained with OH-PLIF data was only successful at predicting the flame attachment, which implies that different physical mechanisms are present for different types of flame transition. Overall, these aspects show the great potential of data-driven methods, particularly probabilistic forecasting techniques, in analyzing and predicting large-scale features in complex turbulent combustion problems."

No restrictive assumption on those absorption and scattering coefficients is imposed. The original inverse source problem is reduced to boundary value problem for a system of coupled partial differential equations of the first order. The unknown source function is not a part of this system. Next, we write this system in the fully discrete form of finite differences. That discrete problem is solved via the quasi-reversibility method. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the regularized solution. Especially, we prove the convergence of regularized solutions to the exact one as the noise level in the data tends to zero via a new discrete Carleman estimate. Numerical simulations demonstrate good performance of this method even when the data is highly noisy."

This suggests that the coronae of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be conducive to the acceleration of non-thermal electrons, in addition to the hot, thermal electrons responsible for their X-ray emission through thermal Comptonization. Here we investigate the mechanism of such particle acceleration, based on observationally inferred parameters for AGN disk coronae. One possibility to account for the observed non-thermal electrons is diffusive shock acceleration, as long as the gyrofactor $\eta_g$ does not exceed $\sim10^6$. These non-thermal electrons can generate gamma rays via inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, which can appear in the MeV band, while those with energies above $\sim100$ MeV would be attenuated via internal $\gamma\gamma$ pair production. The integrated emission from all AGNs with thermal and non-thermal Comptonization can reproduce the observed cosmic background radiation in X-rays as well as gamma-rays up to $\sim 10$ MeV. Furthermore, if protons are accelerated in the same conditions as electrons and $\eta_g\sim30$, our observationally motivated model is also able to account for the diffuse neutrino flux at energies below 100-300 TeV. The next generation of MeV gamma-ray and neutrino facilities can test these expectations by searching for signals from bright, nearby Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151 and IC 4329A."

Unlike synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings, phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled datasets to train an effective SAR model. In this paper, we propose methods to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled conversational data and the available labeled data from synchronous domains. We carry out our research in three main steps. First, we introduce a neural architecture based on hierarchical LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF) for SAR, and show that our method outperforms existing methods when trained on in-domain data only. Second, we improve our initial SAR models by semi-supervised learning in the form of pretrained word embeddings learned from a large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally, we employ adversarial training to improve the results further by leveraging the labeled data from synchronous domains and by explicitly modeling the distributional shift in two domains."

A fitting-based early stopping (FEAST) method is introduced to evaluate the range error of the FNN on test data where the distance of source is unknown. Based on FEAST, when the evaluated range error of the FNN reaches the minimum on test data, stopping training, which will help to improve the ranging accuracy of the FNN on the test data.

Namely, if we deem enumeration to be a way of reaching a number without any ""jump"", there is a ""jump'' in our way of cognition of such greater numbers. In this article, making use of a set theoretical framework by Vop\v{e}nka (1979) (alternative set theory) which describes such structure, we attempt to shed light on an analogous sturucture in human and social phenomenon. As an example, we examine a problem of common knowledge in electronic mail game presented by Rubinstein (1989). We show an event comes to common knowledge by a ""cognitive jump""."

Instead of storing subtrees in a stack --i.e. a data structure with linear-time sequential access-- the proposed system uses a set of parsing items, with constant-time random access. This change makes it possible to construct any discontinuous constituency tree in exactly $4n - 2$ transitions for a sentence of length $n$. At each parsing step, the parser considers every item in the set to be combined with a focus item and to construct a new constituent in a bottom-up fashion. The parsing strategy is based on the assumption that most syntactic structures can be parsed incrementally and that the set --the memory of the parser-- remains reasonably small on average. Moreover, we introduce a provably correct dynamic oracle for the new transition system, and present the first experiments in discontinuous constituency parsing using a dynamic oracle. Our parser obtains state-of-the-art results on three English and German discontinuous treebanks."

Although state-of-the-art methods can obtain decent results in certain situations, performance declines significantly when tackling more general real-world cases. These failures stem from the intrinsic difficulty of single image reflection removal -- the fundamental ill-posedness of the problem, and the insufficiency of densely-labeled training data needed for resolving this ambiguity within learning-based neural network pipelines. In this paper, we address these issues by exploiting targeted network enhancements and the novel use of misaligned data. For the former, we augment a baseline network architecture by embedding context encoding modules that are capable of leveraging high-level contextual clues to reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong reflections. For the latter, we introduce an alignment-invariant loss function that facilitates exploiting misaligned real-world training data that is much easier to collect. Experimental results collectively show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with aligned data, and that significant improvements are possible when using additional misaligned data."

It turns out that if the age of $\mathbb X$ has the strong amalgamation property, then, defining a copy of $\mathbb X$ to be large iff it has infinite intersection with each orbit of $\mathbb X$, the structure $\mathbb X$ can be partitioned into countably many large copies, there are almost disjoint families of large copies of size continuum and, hence, there are (maximal) antichains of size continuum in the poset $\mathbb P (\mathbb X)$. Finally, we show that the posets of copies of all countable ultrahomogeneous partial orders contain maximal antichains of cardinality continuum and determine which of them contain countable maximal antichains. That holds, in particular, for the random (universal ultrahomogeneous) poset."

Using the language of Noether currents we demonstrate the occurrence of a resonant amplification phenomenon, which reduces to the standard superradiance in the hydrodynamic limit. We make use of a time-domain formulation where superradiance emerges as a transient effect encoded in the amplitudes and phases of propagating localised wavepackets. Our findings generalize previous studies in quantum fluids to the case of a non-negligible quantum pressure and can be readily applied also to other physical systems, in particular atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Finally we discuss ongoing experiments to observe superradiance in photon fluids, and how our time domain analysis can be used to characterise superradiant scattering in non-ideal experimental conditions."

The trap environment was cryogenically cooled to a temperature of 17 K in order to efficiently suppress black-body-radiation-induced pumping of the molecules out of trappable quantum states and collisions with residual background gas molecules which usually limit the trap lifetimes. The cold molecules were kept confined on timescales approaching minutes, an improvement of up to two orders of magnitude compared to room-temperature experiments, at translational temperatures on the order of 25 mK. The present results pave the way for spectroscopic studies of trapped molecules with long interaction times enabling high precision, for investigations of cold collisions and reactions with very small reaction rates, for new avenues for the production of ultracold molecules via sympathetic cooling and for the realisation of new forms of hybrid matter with co-trapped atoms or ions."

In this work, we equip the adversarial network with a ""significance-aware information bottleneck (SIB)"", to address the above problem. The new network structure, called SIBAN, enables a significance-aware feature purification before the adversarial adaptation, which eases the feature alignment and stabilizes the adversarial training course. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, we validate that the proposed method can yield leading results compared with other feature-space alternatives. Moreover, SIBAN can even match the state-of-the-art output-space methods in segmentation accuracy, while the latter are often considered to be better choices for domain adaptive segmentation task."

In this work we propose and demonstrate a general quantum algorithm to evolve open quantum dynamics on quantum computing devices. The Kraus operators governing the time evolution can be converted into unitary matrices with minimal dilation guaranteed by the Sz.-Nagy theorem. This allows the evolution of the initial state through unitary quantum gates, while using significantly less resource than required by the conventional Stinespring dilation. We demonstrate the algorithm on an amplitude damping channel using the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator and the IBM Q 5 Tenerife quantum device. The proposed algorithm does not require particular models of dynamics or decomposition of the quantum channel, and thus can be easily generalized to other open quantum dynamical models."

We present an open-source application software, MFV (Magnetic Field Visualizer), for the visualization of the distribution of the magnetic field produced by circular coil systems. MFV models, simulates, and plots the magnetic field of coil systems composed by any number of circular coils of any size placed symmetrically along the same axis. Therefore, any new design or well known coil system, such as the Helmholtz or the Maxwell coil, can be easily modeled and simulated using MFV. A graph of the homogeneity of the magnetic field can be also produced, showing the work region where the magnetic field is homogeneous according to a percentage of homogeneity given by the user. An standardized input and output file format is employed to facilitate the exchange and archiving of data. We include some results obtained using MFV, showing its applicability to characterize the magnetic field in different coil systems. Furthermore, the magnetic field results provided by MFV were validated by comparing them with results obtained experimentally in a Helmholtz coil system."

More precisely, we study the omega-limit of the phase parameter and characterize it completely. Our characterization depends on the first eigenvalue of one of the operators involved: if it is positive, then the chemical potential vanishes at infinity and every element of the omega-limit is a stationary solution to the phase equation; if, instead, the first eigenvalue is 0, then every element of the omega-limit satisfies a problem containing a real function related to the chemical potential. Such a function is nonunique and time dependent, in general, as we show by an example. However, we give sufficient conditions in order that this function be uniquely determined and constant."

Classical nucleation theory (CNT) provides a thermodynamic framework to relate the nucleation rate to thermodynamic quantities such as pressure difference and interfacial tension through the nucleation work necessary to spawn critical nuclei. However, it remains unclear whether such an approach can be extended to the crystallization of driven melts that are subjected to mechanical stresses and flows. Here, we demonstrate numerically for hard spheres that the impact of simple shear on the crystallization rate can be rationalized within the CNT framework by an additional elastic work proportional to the droplet volume. We extract the local stress and strain inside solid droplets, which yield size-dependent values for the shear modulus that are about half of the bulk value. Finally, we show that for a complete description one also has to take into account the change of interfacial work between the strained droplet and the sheared liquid. From scaling reasons, we expect this extra contribution to dominate the work formation of small nuclei but become negligible compared to the elastic work for droplets composed of a few hundreds particles."

Informally, we say that we compare $u$ and $v$ by the infinite order. We show several properties of Lyndon words expressed using this infinite order. The innovative aspect of this approach is that it allows to take into account also non trivial conditions on the prefixes of a word, instead that only on the suffixes. In particular, we derive a result of Ufnarovskij [V. Ufnarovskij, ""Combinatorial and asymptotic methods in algebra"", 1995] that characterizes a Lyndon word as a word which is greater, with respect to the infinite order, than all its prefixes. Motivated by this result, we introduce the prefix standard permutation of a Lyndon word and the corresponding (left) Cartesian tree. We prove that the left Cartesian tree is equal to the left Lyndon tree, defined by the left standard factorization of Viennot [G. Viennot, ""Alg\`ebres de Lie libres et mono\""ides libres"", 1978]. This result is dual with respect to a theorem of Hohlweg and Reutenauer [C. Hohlweg and C. Reutenauer, ""Lyndon words, permutations and trees"", 2003]."

These Green's functions are introduced as a generalization of the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory and the calculations of their diagonal elements can naturally give the effective propagators which are equal to the ones in the Feenberg perturbation theory.

We show that the alignment process of an initially misaligned circumbinary disc around an eccentric orbit binary is significantly different than around a circular orbit binary and involves tilt oscillations. The more eccentric the binary, the larger the tilt oscillations and the longer it takes to damp these oscillations. A circumbinary disc that is only mildly inclined may increase its inclination by a factor of a few before it moves towards alignment. The results of the SPH simulations agree well with those of linear theory. We investigate the properties of the circumbinary disc/ring around KH 15D. We determine disc properties based on the observational constraints imposed by the changing binary brightness. We find that the inclination is currently at a local minimum and will increase substantially before setting to coplanarity. In addition, the nodal precession is currently near its most rapid rate. The recent observations that show a reappearance of Star B impose constraints on the thickness of the layer of obscuring material. Our results suggest that disc solids have undergone substantial inward drift and settling towards to disc midplane. For disc masses $\sim 0.001 M_\odot$, our model indicates that the level of disc turbulence is low $\alpha \ll 0.001$. Another possibility is that the disc/ring contains little gas."

Upon 50 \% dilution of the Eu sites with isovalent Ca$^{2+}$, the Eu sublattice is found to be still long-range ordered below $\mathit{T_{Eu}}$ = 10 K, in the A-typed antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure. The moment size of Eu$^{2+}$ spins is estimated to be as large as 6.74(4) $\mu_{B}$ at 2.5 K. The Fe sublattice undergoes a spin-density-wave transition at $\mathit{T_{SDW}}$ = 192(2) K and displays an in-plane AFM structure above $\mathit{T_{Eu}}$. However, at 2.5 K, the Fe$^{2+}$ moments are found to be ordered in a canted AFM structure with a canting angle of 14(4){\deg} out of the $\mathit{ab}$ plane. The spin reorientation of Fe below the AFM ordering temperature of Eu provides a direct evidence of a strong interplay between the two magnetic sublattices in Eu$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$."

The X-ray variability is largely determined by mass accretion rate fluctuations at the NS surface, which replicate accretion rate fluctuations at the inner radius of the accretion disc. The variability at the inner radius is due to fluctuations arising all over the disc and propagating inwards under the influence of viscous diffusion. The inner radius varies with mean mass accretion rate and can be estimated from the known magnetic field strength and accretion luminosity of XRPs. Observations of transient XRPs covering several orders of magnitude in luminosity give a unique opportunity to study effects arising due to the changes of the inner disc radius. We investigate the process of viscous diffusion in XRP accretion discs and construct new analytical solutions of the diffusion equation applicable for thin accretion discs truncated both from inside and outside. Our solutions are the most general ones derived in the approximation of Newtonian mechanics. We argue that the break observed at high frequencies in the power density spectra of XRPs corresponds to the minimal time scale of the dynamo process, which is responsible for the initial fluctuations. Comparing data from the bright X-ray transient A 0535+26 with our model, we conclude that the time scale of initial variability in the accretion disc is a few times longer than the local Keplerian time scale."

During the interaction with this wave the electron also radiates photons via the Compton scattering. Synergic Cherenkov-Compton process can be observed by colliding laser accelerated electrons with a high intensity electromagnetic pulse. Extremely high energy photons cannot be emitted via the Cherenkov radiation because the vacuum refraction index tends to unity at these energies.

We adapt Optical flow ConvNets initially proposed by Simonyan et al.. While Simonyan uses both RGB frames and dense optical flow, we use only dense optical flow representations as input to emphasize the role of motion in surgical gesture recognition, and present it as a robust alternative to kinematic data. We also overcome one of the limitations of Optical flow ConvNets by initializing our model with cross modality pre-training. A large number of promising studies that address surgical gesture recognition highly rely on kinematic data which requires additional recording devices. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses surgical gesture recognition using dense optical flow information only. We achieve competitive results on JIGSAWS dataset, moreover, our model achieves more robust results with less standard deviation, which suggests optical flow information can be used as an alternative to kinematic data for the recognition of surgical gestures."

For training data, we collect videos of various reflective spheres placed within the camera's FOV, leaving most of the background unoccluded, leveraging that materials with diverse reflectance functions reveal different lighting cues in a single exposure. We train a deep neural network to regress from the LDR background image to HDR lighting by matching the LDR ground truth sphere images to those rendered with the predicted illumination using image-based relighting, which is differentiable. Our inference runs at interactive frame rates on a mobile device, enabling realistic rendering of virtual objects into real scenes for mobile mixed reality. Training on automatically exposed and white-balanced videos, we improve the realism of rendered objects compared to the state-of-the art methods for both indoor and outdoor scenes."

Using an information-theoretic approach, this work tackles the problem of quantifying the potential latency reduction that can be obtained by enabling Device-to-Device (D2D) communication over out-of-band broadcast links. Following prior work, the Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) --- a metric that captures the high signal-to-noise ratio worst-case latency --- is adopted as the performance criterion of interest. Joint edge caching, downlink transmission, and D2D communication policies based on compress-and-forward are proposed that are shown to be information-theoretically optimal to within a constant multiplicative factor of two for all values of the problem parameters, and to achieve the minimum NDT for a number of special cases. The analysis provides insights on the role of D2D cooperation in improving the delivery latency."

Accurate and timely diagnosis can improve the quality of life of cataract patients. In this paper, a feature extraction-based method for grading cataract severity using retinal images is proposed. To obtain more appropriate features for the automatic grading, the Haar wavelet is improved according to the characteristics of retinal images. Retinal images of non-cataract, as well as mild, moderate, and severe cataracts, are automatically recognized using the improved Haar wavelet. A hierarchical strategy is used to transform the four-class classification problem into three adjacent two-class classification problems. Three sets of two-class classifiers based on a neural network are trained individually and integrated together to establish a complete classification system. The accuracies of the two-class classification (cataract and non-cataract) and four-class classification are 94.83% and 85.98%, respectively. The performance analysis demonstrates that the improved Haar wavelet feature achieves higher accuracy than the original Haar wavelet feature, and the fusion of three sets of two-class classifiers is superior to a simple four-class classifier. The discussion indicates that the retinal image-based method offers significant potential for cataract detection."

In this paper, we propose a Deep Conditional Variational Autoencoder based model that synthesizes diverse anatomically plausible 3D-pose samples conditioned on the estimated 2D-pose. We show that CVAE-based 3D-pose sample set is consistent with the 2D-pose and helps tackling the inherent ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. We propose two strategies for obtaining the final 3D pose- (a) depth-ordering/ordinal relations to score and weight-average the candidate 3D-poses, referred to as OrdinalScore, and (b) with supervision from an Oracle. We report close to state of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets using OrdinalScore, and state-of-the-art results using the Oracle. We also show that our pipeline yields competitive results without paired image-to-3D annotations. The training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/ssfootball04/generative_pose."

Existing methods often iteratively search for the optimal geometric transformation to register a given pair of point sets, driven by minimizing a predefined alignment loss function. In contrast, the proposed point registration neural network (PR-Net) actively learns the registration pattern as a parametric function from a training dataset, consequently predict the desired geometric transformation to align a pair of point sets. PR-Net can transfer the learned knowledge (i.e. registration pattern) from registering training pairs to testing ones without additional iterative optimization. Specifically, in this paper, we develop novel techniques to learn shape descriptors from point sets that help formulate a clear correlation between source and target point sets. With the defined correlation, PR-Net tends to predict the transformation so that the source and target point sets can be statistically aligned, which in turn leads to an optimal spatial geometric registration. PR-Net achieves robust and superior performance for non-rigid registration of point sets, even in presence of Gaussian noise, outliers, and missing points, but requires much less time for registering large number of pairs. More importantly, for a new pair of point sets, PR-Net is able to directly predict the desired transformation using the learned model without repetitive iterative optimization routine. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lingjing324/PR-Net."

The importance of learning feature interactions has been emphasized by many works. Many deep models are proposed to automatically learn high-order feature interactions. Since most features in advertising system and recommendation system are high-dimensional sparse features, deep models usually learn a low-dimensional distributed representation for each feature in the bottom layer. Besides traditional fully-connected architectures, some new operations, such as convolutional operations and product operations, are proposed to learn feature interactions better. In these models, the representation is shared among different operations. However, the best representation for different operations may be different. In this paper, we propose a new neural model named Operation-aware Neural Networks (ONN) which learns different representations for different operations. Our experimental results on two large-scale real-world ad click/conversion datasets demonstrate that ONN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both offline-training environment and online-training environment."

The success of ResNets and DenseNets is due in large part to their innovative wiring plans. Now, neural architecture search (NAS) studies are exploring the joint optimization of wiring and operation types, however, the space of possible wirings is constrained and still driven by manual design despite being searched. In this paper, we explore a more diverse set of connectivity patterns through the lens of randomly wired neural networks. To do this, we first define the concept of a stochastic network generator that encapsulates the entire network generation process. Encapsulation provides a unified view of NAS and randomly wired networks. Then, we use three classical random graph models to generate randomly wired graphs for networks. The results are surprising: several variants of these random generators yield network instances that have competitive accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark. These results suggest that new efforts focusing on designing better network generators may lead to new breakthroughs by exploring less constrained search spaces with more room for novel design."

The faint-end of the galaxy LF at these redshifts provides powerful constraints on different dark matter models that suppress small-scale structure formation. In this work we perform full hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation using an alternative DM model composed of extremely light bosonic particles ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV), also known as fuzzy dark matter (FDM), and examine the predictions for the galaxy stellar mass function and luminosity function at $z \geq 6$ for a range of FDM masses. We find that for FDM models with bosonic mass $m = 5\times10^{-22}$ eV, the number density of galaxies with stellar mass $\rm M_* \sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ is suppressed by $\sim 40\%$ at z = 9, $\sim 20\%$ at z = 5, and the UV LFs within magnitude range of -16 < $M_{\rm UV}$ < -14 is suppressed by $\sim 60\%$ at $z = 9$, $\sim 20\%$ at $z = 5$ comparing to the CDM counterpart simulation. Comparing our predictions with current measurements of the faint-end LFs ($-18 \leqslant M_{\rm UV} \leqslant -14$), we find that FDM models with $m_{22} < 5\times10^{-22}$ are ruled out at $3\sigma$ confidence level. We expect that future LF measurements by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will extend down to $M_{\rm UV} \sim -13$ for $z \lesssim 10$, with a survey volume that is comparable to the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) would have the capability to constrain FDM models to $m\; \gtrsim 10^{-21}$ eV."

From nuclear physics we know that this mode is the main responsible for the attractive part of the nucleon-nucleon potential at inter-particle distances of 1-2 fm. Therefore one expects that close to the critical point there is a long-range strong attraction among nucleons. Using a Walecka-Serot model for the NN potential we study the effects of the critical point in a finite system of nucleons and mesons by solving classical Molecular Dynamics+Langevin equations for the freeze-out conditions of heavy-ion collisions. Going beyond the mean-field approximation allows us to account for strong nucleon correlations in the time evolution, leading to baryon clustering. We observe that light cluster formation, together with an enhancement of higher-order cumulants of the proton distribution can signal the presence of the critical point."

While these approaches demonstrate encouraging performance, they are typically based on a single modality and are unable to leverage information from other modalities, such as a camera. Although a few approaches fuse data from different modalities, these methods either use a complicated pipeline to process the modalities sequentially, or perform late-fusion and are unable to learn interaction between different modalities at early stages. In this work, we present PointFusion and VoxelFusion: two simple yet effective early-fusion approaches to combine the RGB and point cloud modalities, by leveraging the recently introduced VoxelNet architecture. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates significant improvements in performance over approaches which only use point cloud data. Furthermore, the proposed method provides results competitive with the state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, achieving top-2 ranking in five of the six bird's eye view and 3D detection categories on the KITTI benchmark, by using a simple single stage network."

Based on the results of this survey, we have developed a multi-touch virtual globe derived from an adapted virtual globe paradigm designed to widen the potential uses of the technology by helping its users to inquire about both the ""what is where"" and ""why"" of spatial distribution. We do not seek to provide users with full GIS (geographic information system) functionality, but rather we aim to facilitate the asking and answering of simple ""why"" questions about general topics that appeal to a wide virtual globe user base."

The demodulation filters take the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which computes the log-posteriori probability of observing a transmission symbol given the continuous history of receptor activities. A limitation of our earlier work is that the receiver is assumed to be a small cubic volume called a voxel. In this work, we extend the maximum a-posteriori demodulation to the case where the receiver may consist of multiple voxels and derive the ODE for log-posteriori probability calculation. This extension allows us to study receiver behaviour of different volumes and shapes. In particular, it also allows us to consider spatially partitioned receivers where the chemicals in the receiver are not allowed to mix. The key result of this paper is that spatial partitioning can be used to reduce bit-error rate in diffusion-based molecular communications."

One form of machine learning - Active Learning - has drawn attention from the legal community because it offers the potential to make the machine learning process even more effective. Active Learning, applied to legal documents, is considered a new technology in the legal domain and is continuously applied to all documents in a legal matter until an insignificant number of relevant documents are left for review. This implementation is slightly different than traditional implementations of Active Learning where the process stops once achieving acceptable model performance. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to question whether Active Learning actually is a superior learning methodology and (ii) to highlight the ways that Active Learning can be most effectively applied to real legal industry data. Unlike other studies, our experiments were performed against large data sets taken from recent, real-world legal matters covering a variety of areas. We conclude that, although these experiments show the Active Learning strategy popularly used in legal document review can quickly identify informative training documents, it becomes less effective over time. In particular, our findings suggest this most popular form of Active Learning in the legal arena, where the highest-scoring documents are selected as training examples, is in fact not the most efficient approach in most instances. Ultimately, a different Active Learning strategy may be best suited to initiate the predictive modeling process but not to continue through the entire document review."

Especially, in the complex case, our result is a refinement of the result of Nesterenko-Waldschmidt on the lower bound of linear form in certain values of power of logarithms.

A molecular cloud at a distance of 3.2 kpc is spatially coincident with the western part of the SNR, and it is likely hit by the SNR. The X-ray emission from this part of the shell is much lower than from the rest of the SNR. Moreover, a compact GeV emission region coincident with the cloud has been detected with a soft spectrum. These observations seem to imply a shock-cloud collision scenario at this area, where the stalled shock can no longer accelerate super-TeV electrons or maintain strong magnetic turbulence downstream, while the GeV cosmic rays (CRs) are released through this stalled shock. To test this hypothesis, we have performed a detailed Fermi-LAT reanalysis of the HESS J1731-347 region with over 9 years of data. We find that the compact GeV emission region displays a spectral power-law index of -2.4, whereas the GeV emission from the rest of the SNR (excluding the cloud region) has an index of -1.8. A hadronic model involving a shock-cloud collision scenario is built to explain the -ray emission from this area. It consists of three CR sources: run-away super-TeV CRs that have escaped from the fast shock, leaked GeV CRs from the stalled shock, and the local CR sea. The X-ray and -ray emission of the SNR excluding the shock-cloud interaction region is explained in a one-zone leptonic model. Our shock-cloud collision model explains well the GeV-TeV observations from both cloud regions around HESS J1731-347, i.e. from the cloud in contact with the SNR and from the more distant cloud which is coincident with the nearby TeV source HESS J1729-345. We find however that the leaked GeV CRs from the shock-cloud collision do not necessarily dominate the GeV emission from the clouds, due to a comparable contribution from the local CR sea."

For three typical unimodal frequency distributions, namely, the Lorentzian, the triangle, and the uniform, we found that the first-order transition occurs when the frequency distribution is relatively compact, while the synchronization transition is continuous when it is relatively wide. In both cases, there is a regime of Bellerophon state between the incoherent state and the synchronized state. Remarkably, we revealed novel transition behavior for such coupled oscillators with amplitudes, i.e., the regime of Bellerophon state actually contains two stages. In the first stage, the oscillators achieve chaotic phase synchronization; while in the second stage, oscillators form periodical phase synchronization. Our results suggest that Bellerophon state also exists in coupled oscillators with amplitude dynamics."

This is because the potential distribution of image conditions is hard to measure precisely from its latent variable $z$. In this paper, based on modeling a joint probabilistic density of an image and its conditions, we propose a novel flow-based generative model named conditional adversarial generative flow (CAGlow). Instead of disentangling attributes from latent space, we blaze a new trail for learning an encoder to estimate the mapping from condition space to latent space in an adversarial manner. Given a specific condition $c$, CAGlow can encode it to a sampled $z$, and then enable robust conditional image synthesis in complex situations like combining person identity with multiple attributes. The proposed CAGlow can be implemented in both supervised and unsupervised manners, thus can synthesize images with conditional information like categories, attributes, and even some unknown properties. Extensive experiments show that CAGlow ensures the independence of different conditions and outperforms regular Glow to a significant extent."

In this method, the photon free streaming and scattering processes are treated in an un-splitting way. The duality descriptions, namely the simulation particle and distribution function, are utilized to describe the photon. By accurately recovering the governing equations of the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the UGKWP preserves the multiscale dynamics of photon transport from optically thin to optically thick regime. In the optically thin regime, the UGKWP becomes a Monte Carlo type particle tracking method, while in the optically thick regime, the UGKWP becomes a diffusion equation solver. The local photon dynamics of the UGKWP, as well as the proportion of wave-described and particle-described photons are automatically adapted according to the numerical resolution and transport regime. Compared to the $S_n$ -type UGKS, the UGKWP requires less memory cost and does not suffer ray effect. Compared to the implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) method, the statistical noise of UGKWP is greatly reduced and computational efficiency is significantly improved in the optically thick regime. Several numerical examples covering all transport regimes from the optically thin to optically thick are computed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the UGKWP method. In comparison to the $S_n$ -type UGKS and IMC method, the UGKWP method may have several-order-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost and memory requirement in solving some multsicale transport problems."

We calculate the electronic transmission probability by using a multi-orbital tight-binding model based on the first-principles band structure. The transmission probability depends on the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This dependence qualitatively changes by the interface structure. The heterostructure with a zig-zag interface preserves the spin and the valley of electron in the transmission process. On the other hand, the armchair interface enables conduction electrons to transmit with changing the valley and increases the conductance in hole-doped junctions due to the valley-flip transmission. We also discuss the spin and valley polarizations of electronic current in the heterojunctions."

In the limit of large $N$, when the average density of eigenvalues becomes uniform over the unit disk, we show that for $0<r<1$ the fluctuations of $N_r$ around its mean value $\langle N_r \rangle \approx N r^2$ display three different regimes: (i) a typical Gaussian regime where the fluctuations are of order ${\cal O}(N^{1/4})$, (ii) an intermediate regime where $N_r - \langle N_r \rangle = {\cal O}(\sqrt{N})$, and (iii) a large deviation regime where $N_r - \langle N_r \rangle = {\cal O}({N})$. This intermediate behaviour (ii) had been overlooked in previous studies and we show here that it ensures a smooth matching between the typical and the large deviation regimes. In addition, we demonstrate that this intermediate regime controls all the (centred) cumulants of $N_r$, which are all of order ${\cal O}(\sqrt{N})$, and we compute them explicitly. Our analytical results are corroborated by precise ""importance sampling"" Monte Carlo simulations."

This approach yields point estimates of model parameters, uncertainty of these estimates can be assessed e.g. by an additional bootstrapping analysis. Here, we present a Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach for tracer-kinetic analysis with a Tofts model, which yields posterior probability distributions of perfusion parameters and therefore promises a robust and information-enriched alternative based on a framework of probability distributions. In this manuscript, we use the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) Tofts phantom to evaluate the Bayesian Tofts Model (BTM) against a bootstrapped NLLS approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Bayesian posterior probability distributions can be employed to assess treatment response in a breast cancer DCE-MRI dataset using Cohen's d. Accuracy and precision of the BTM posterior distributions were validated and found to be in good agreement with the NLLS approaches, and assessment of therapy response with respect to uncertainty in parameter estimates was found to be excellent. In conclusion, the Bayesian modeling approach provides an elegant means to determine uncertainty via posterior distributions within a single step and provides honest information about changes in parameter estimates."

A popular approach to mathematically formalize causality is based on vector autoregressive (VAR) models, which constitutes an alternative to the well-known but usually intractable Granger causality. Relying on such a VAR causality notion, this paper develops two algorithms with complementary benefits to track time-varying causality graphs in an online fashion. Despite using data in a sequential fashion, both algorithms are shown to asymptotically attain the same average performance as a batch estimator with all data available at once. Moreover, their constant complexity per update renders these algorithms appealing for big-data scenarios. Theoretical and experimental performance analysis support the merits of the proposed algorithms. Remarkably, no probabilistic models or stationarity assumptions need to be introduced, which endows the developed algorithms with considerable generality"

The demonstrated stabilization of chiral magnetic domain walls and skyrmions has been attributed to the actively investigated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Recently, however, predictions were made that suggest dipolar interactions can also stabilize chiral domain walls and skyrmions, but direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here we show that dipolar interactions can indeed stabilize chiral domain walls by directly imaging the magnetic domain walls using scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis. We further show that the competition between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and dipolar interactions can reverse the domain-wall chirality. Finally, we suggest that this competition can be tailored by a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. Our work therefore reveals that dipolar interactions play a key role in the stabilization of chiral spin textures. This insight will open up new routes towards balancing interactions for the stabilization of chiral magnetism."

In this manuscript, we present a quantitative performance comparison between these two approaches by taking into account implementational restrictions, such as antenna switching. We consider a band-limitedMIMO system, for which the pulse shape is designed, such that the outband emission satisfies a desired spectral mask. The bit error rate is determined for this system, considering antenna selection and spatial modulation. The results depict that for any array size at the transmit and receive sides, antenna selection outperforms spatial modulation, as long as the power efficiency is smaller than a certain threshold level. By passing this threshold, spatial modulation starts to perform superior. Our investigations show that the threshold takes smaller values, as the number of receive antennas grows large. This indicates that spatial modulation is an effective technique for uplink transmission in massive MIMO systems."

One large class of such $Z$ is what we call $(m,n)$-grids. We relate this problem to the {\em unexpected cone property} ${\mathcal C}(d)$, a special case of the unexpected hypersurfaces which have been the focus of much recent research. After an analysis of ${\mathcal C}(d)$ for small $d$, we show that a non-degenerate set of $9$ points has a general projection that is the complete intersection of two cubics if and only if the points form a $(3,3)$-grid. However, in an appendix we describe a set of $24$ points that are not a grid but nevertheless have the projection property. These points arise from the $F_4$ root system. Furthermore, from this example we find subsets of $20$, $16$ and $12$ points with the same feature."

Dynamical studies of multiple moons find that these satellite systems are not stable, resulting in moonlet collision or loss of one or more of the moonlets. We perform Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) impact simulations of two orbiting moonlets inside the planetary gravitational potential and find that the classical outcome of two bodies impacting in free space is altered as erosive mass loss is more significant with decreasing distance to the planet. Depending on the conditions of accretion, each moonlet could have a distinct isotopic signature, therefore, we assess the initial mixing during their merger, in order to estimate whether future measurements of surface variations could distinguish between lunar origin scenarios (single vs. multiple moonlets). We find that for comparable-size impacting bodies in the accretionary regime, surface mixing is efficient, but in the hit-and-run regime, only a small amount of material is transferred between the bodies. However, sequences of hit-and-run impacts are expected, which will enhance the surface mixing. Overall, our results show that large scale heterogeneities can arise only from the merger of drastically different component masses. Surfaces of moons resulting from the merger of comparable-sized components have little material heterogeneities, and such impacts are preferred, as the relatively massive impactor generates more melt, extending the lunar magma ocean phase."

The models have symmetry-breaking transitions, so the typical magnetisation of a growing cluster may be either positive or negative, with equal probability. For large clusters, the magnetisation obeys a large deviation principle. We show that the corresponding rate function is zero for values of the magnetisation that are intermediate between the two steady state values, which means that fluctuations with these values of the magnetisation are much less unlikely than previously thought. We show that their probabilities decay as power laws in the cluster size, instead of the exponential scaling that would be expected from the large deviation principle. We discuss how this observation is related to dynamical phase coexistence phenomena. We also comment on the typical size of magnetisation fluctuations."

Nine of these supernovae were discovered by ASAS-SN, four by ATLAS, four by ZTF, and one by \textit{Gaia}. For eight of these objects with sufficient dynamic range ($>$3.0 mag from detection to peak), we fit power law models and search for signatures of companion stars. Most of our sources are consistent with fireball models where the flux increases $\propto t^2$, while two display a flatter rise with flux $\propto t$. We do not find any obvious evidence for additional structure such as multiple power law components in the early rising light curves. Assuming a favorable viewing angle, we place conservative upper limits on the radii of any companion stars of less than 25 R$_\odot$ for six supernovae and less than 4 R$_\odot$ for 4 supernovae. If such systems are commonplace, the odds of non-detection in this sample are 38\% for companions $\gtrsim$25\,R$\odot$ and 52\% for companions $\gtrsim$4\,R$\odot$. Based on the examples in this work, we expect that TESS will either detect emission from a dwarf companion during its initial two year survey, or place stringent limits on single-degenerate progenitor models."

For this we use the pre-trained LMs as fixed feature extractors and restrict the downstream task models to not have additional sequence modeling layers. We compare BERT, ELMo, BioBERT and BioELMo, a biomedical version of ELMo trained on 10M PubMed abstracts. Surprisingly, while fine-tuned BioBERT is better than BioELMo in biomedical NER and NLI tasks, as a fixed feature extractor BioELMo outperforms BioBERT in our probing tasks.

A thorough asymptotic analysis and simulations both demonstrate that this new class of statistics possess superior power compared to traditional change point statistics based on the CUSUM process when the change point is near the beginning or end of the sample. Generalizations of these ""R\'enyi"" statistics are also developed to test for changes in the parameters in linear and non-linear regression models, and in generalized method of moments estimation. In these contexts we applied the proposed statistics, as well as several others, to test for changes in the coefficients of Fama-French factor models.

We make use of a recently developed, systematically improvable variational approach which allows us to treat both isotopes on an equal footing. We confirm that no commensurate crystalline second layer of He-4 forms, in agreement with all recent calculations. Interestingly and more significantly, we find that even for He-3 there is no evidence of such a phase, as the system freezes into an {\it incommensurate} crystal at a coverage lower than that (4/7) at which a commensurate one has been predicted, and for which experimental claims have been made.

However, the inherent deformability of soft robots places both a greater onus on accurate modelling of their shape, and greater challenges in realising intraoperative shape sensing. Herein we present a proprioceptive (self-sensing) soft actuator, with an electrically conductive working fluid. Electrical impedance measurements from up to six electrodes enabled tomographic reconstructions using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). A new Frequency Division Multiplexed (FDM) EIT system was developed capable of measurements of 66 dB SNR with 20 ms temporal resolution. The concept was examined in two two-degree-of-freedom designs: a hydraulic hinged actuator and a pneumatic finger actuator with hydraulic beams. Both cases demonstrated that impedance measurements could be used to infer shape changes, and EIT images reconstructed during actuation showed distinct patterns with respect to each degree of freedom (DOF). Whilst there was some mechanical hysteresis observed, the repeatability of the measurements and resultant images was high. The results show the potential of FDM-EIT as a low-cost, low profile shape sensor in soft robots."

The effects on effort estimation accuracy of having obsolete requirements in specifications have not yet been studied. This study aims at filling that gap. A total of 150 students were asked to provide effort estimates for different amounts of requirements, and one group was explicitly told to disregard some of the given requirements. The results show that even the extra text instructing participants to exclude requirements in the estimation task, had the subjects give higher estimates. The effect of having obsolete requirements in requirements specifications and backlogs in software effort estimation is not taken into account enough today, and this study provides empirical evidence that it possibly should.

Accurate and reliable theoretical predictions of these properties require incorporation of both high-order correlation and relativistic effects in the calculations. In this work theoretical investigations of the ground and the lowest excited states of BaF and its lighter homologues, CaF and SrF, are carried out in the framework of the relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods. Using the calculated molecular properties, we determine the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) for the $A^2\Pi_{1/2} \rightarrow X^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2}$ transition, which was successfully used for cooling CaF and SrF and is now considered for BaF. For all three species, the FCFs are found to be highly diagonal. Calculations are also performed for the $B^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2} \rightarrow X^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2}$ transition recently exploited for laser-cooling of CaF; it is shown that this transition is not suitable for laser-cooling of BaF, due to the non-diagonal nature of the FCFs in this system. Special attention is given to the properties of the $A'^2\Delta$ state, which in the case of BaF causes a leak channel, in contrast to CaF and SrF species where this state is energetically above the excited states used in laser-cooling. We also present the dipole moments of the ground and the excited states of the three molecules and the transition dipole moments (TDMs) between the different states."

This extension of the minimal model leads to a new complex pNGB that has hypercharge and is a singlet of SU(2)$_L$, with properties mostly determined by the pattern of symmetry breaking and a mass of order TeV. Composite electroweak unification also leads to new bosonic and fermion resonances with exotic charges, not present in the minimal model. The lightest of these resonances is stable, and in some cases could provide candidates for dark matter. A new rich phenomenology is expected at LHC."

Still, many MF algorithms do not adequately scale with the size of available datasets and/or lack interpretability. To improve the computational efficiency of the method, an online (streaming) MF algorithm was proposed in Mairal et al. [2010]. To enable data interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was introduced in Ding et al. [2010]. In the latter work, the basis vectors are required to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that every basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No current algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is challenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete dataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF algorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative data samples needed for interpreting each of the basis (Ding et al. [2010]) and has the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning algorithm of Mairal et al. [2010]. Our proof techniques combine random coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant computational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to classical convex MF. Since the proposed method maintains small representative sets of data samples needed for convex interpretations, it is related to a body of work in theoretical computer science, pertaining to generating point sets (Blum et al. [2016]), and in computer vision, pertaining to archetypal analysis (Mei et al. [2018]). Nevertheless, it differs from these lines of work both in terms of the objective and algorithmic implementations."

We study limits of such particle systems in the case when the average degree of $G_n$ remains almost surely bounded. Specifically, under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and initial conditions, we show that if $G_n$ converges in distribution in the sense of local convergence to a locally finite graph $G$, then the corresponding particle dynamics converge weakly locally to a certain limit diffusion on $G$. We also show that for certain graph sequences, including sparse Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph sequences, the limit of the empirical measure is deterministic and coincides with the law of a typical particle; but show that in general, the empirical measure limit may fail to coincide with the law of a typical particle, and it could even remain stochastic. Furthermore, when $G$ is a unimodular Galton-Watson tree, under suitable assumptions we characterize the limiting dynamics of the neighborhood of a typical particle in terms of a certain finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose infinitesimal evolution at any time depends not only on the current state of the neighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given the past of the neighborhood process until that time. This resolves the open problem of characterizing the limiting dynamics on sequences of sparse Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. Important ingredients of the proofs include correlation decay estimates, a second-order Markov random field property for particle trajectories, and a stochastic analytic result on mimicking It\^{o} processes."

A key ingredient is a new quantity which we call isothermal radius. Using the estimate of the isothermal radius we establish a compactness theorem of such surfaces in intrinsic $L^p$-topology and extrinsic $W^{2,2}$-weak topology. As applications, we can explain Leon Simon's decomposition theorem\cite{LS} in the viewpoint of convergence and prove a non-collapsing version of H\'{e}lein's convergence theorem\cite{H}\cite{KL12}."

However, it assumes that data points are Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) so that samples used in the training and test sets can be selected randomly and uniformly. In Human Activity Recognition datasets, we note that the samples produced by the same subjects are likely to be correlated due to diverse factors. Hence, k-fold cross validation may overestimate the performance of activity recognizers, in particular when overlapping sliding windows are used. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Subject Cross Validation on the performance of Human Activity Recognition, both with non-overlapping and with overlapping sliding windows. Results show that k-fold cross validation artificially increases the performance of recognizers by about 10%, and even by 16% when overlapping windows are used. In addition, we do not observe any performance gain from the use of overlapping windows. We conclude that Human Activity Recognition systems should be evaluated by Subject Cross Validation, and that overlapping windows are not worth their extra computational cost."

This has several topological applications: The torsion order gives lower bounds on the bridge index and the band-unlinking number of a knot, the fusion number of a ribbon knot, and the number of minima appearing in a slice disk of a knot. It also gives a lower bound on the number of bands appearing in a ribbon concordance between two knots. Our bounds on the bridge index and fusion number are sharp for $T_{p,q}$ and $T_{p,q}\# \overline{T}_{p,q}$, respectively. We also show that the bridge index of $T_{p,q}$ is minimal within its concordance class.   The torsion order bounds a refinement of the cobordism distance on knots, which is a metric. As a special case, we can bound the number of band moves required to get from one knot to the other. We show knot Floer homology also gives a lower bound on Sarkar's ribbon distance, and exhibit examples of ribbon knots with arbitrarily large ribbon distance from the unknot."

For a two-level system coupled to classical radiation fields, three semiclassical methods are benchmarked: (1) Ehrenfest dynamics over-estimate the excited state population at equilibrium due to the failure of capturing vacuum fluctuations. (2) The coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations, which supplement Ehrenfest dynamics by damping at the full golden rule rate, under-estimate the excited state population due to double-counting of the self-interaction effect. (3) Ehrenfest+R dynamics recover detailed balance and the correct thermal equilibrium by enforcing the correct balance between the optical excitation and spontaneous emission of the quantum system. These results highlight the fact that, when properly designed, mixed quantum-classical electrodynamics can simulate thermal equilibrium in the field of nanoplasmonics."

The detection of low energy recoiled protons in DUNE allows for a determination of the leptonic $CP$-violating phase independent from the accelerator neutrino measurement.

Moreover, the determination of the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino flux will have important consequences in the detection of diffuse supernova neutrinos and in dark matter experiments."

In FD methods, the fluid momentum equation is extended within the solid domain using an additional body force that constrains the structure velocity to be that of a rigid body. Using this formulation, a single set of equations is solved over the entire computational domain. The constraint force is calculated in two distinct ways: one using an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework of the immersed boundary (IB) method and another using a fully-Eulerian approach of the Brinkman penalization (BP) method. Both FSI strategies use the same multiphase flow algorithm that solves the discrete incompressible Navier-Stokes system in conservative form. A consistent transport scheme is employed to advect mass and momentum in the domain, which ensures numerical stability of high density ratio multiphase flows involved in practical marine engineering applications. Example cases of a free falling wedge (straight and inclined) and cylinder are simulated, and the numerical results are compared against benchmark cases in literature."

We also identify families of states reaching these lower or upper bounds. Moreover, we numerically study the probability of randomly generating pure states close to these energetic bounds finding, in all the considered configurations, that it is extremely low except for the two-qubit case and highly degenerate cases. Then, we show that the bounds found for pure states are valid also for mixed states. These results can be important in quantum technologies to design energetically more efficient entanglement generation protocols. Finally, we point out formal analogies between the bound states we found and thermal states."

A core task, which has received significant attention in recent years, is building generative models of source code. However, to our knowledge, previous generative models have always been framed in terms of generating static snapshots of code. In this work, we instead treat source code as a dynamic object and tackle the problem of modeling the edits that software developers make to source code files. This requires extracting intent from previous edits and leveraging it to generate subsequent edits. We develop several neural networks and use synthetic data to test their ability to learn challenging edit patterns that require strong generalization. We then collect and train our models on a large-scale dataset of Google source code, consisting of millions of fine-grained edits from thousands of Python developers. From the modeling perspective, our main conclusion is that a new composition of attentional and pointer network components provides the best overall performance and scalability. From the application perspective, our results provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of developing tools that learn to predict future edits."

However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allows us to collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep neural network models of their state transitions. But there remains one major problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we introduce two types of nonlinear planning methods that can leverage deep neural network learned transition models: Hybrid Deep MILP Planner (HD-MILP-Plan) and Tensorflow Planner (TF-Plan). In HD-MILP-Plan, we make the critical observation that the Rectified Linear Unit transfer function for deep networks not only allows faster convergence of model learning, but also permits a direct compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program encoding. Further, we identify deep network specific optimizations for HD-MILP-Plan that improve performance over a base encoding and show that we can plan optimally with respect to the learned deep networks. In TF-Plan, we take advantage of the efficiency of auto-differentiation tools and GPU-based computation where we encode a subclass of purely continuous planning problems as Recurrent Neural Networks and directly optimize the actions through backpropagation. We compare both planners and show that TF-Plan is able to approximate the optimal plans found by HD-MILP-Plan in less computation time..."

However, relatively less attention has been put on video compression using deep learning networks. In the paper, we first propose a deep learning based bi-predictive coding network, called BP-DVC Net, for video compression. Learned from the lesson of the conventional video coding, a B-frame coding structure is incorporated in our BP-DVC Net. While the bi-predictive coding in the conventional video codecs requires to transmit to decoder sides the motion vectors for block motion and the residues from prediction, our BP-DVC Net incorporates optical flow estimation networks in both encoder and decoder sides so as not to transmit the motion information to the decoder sides for coding efficiency improvement. Also, a bi-prediction network in the BP-DVC Net is proposed and used to precisely predict the current frame and to yield the resulting residues as small as possible. Furthermore, our BP-DVC Net allows for the compressive feature maps to be entropy-coded using the temporal context among the feature maps of adjacent frames. The BP-DVC Net has an end-to-end video compression architecture with newly designed flow and prediction losses. Experimental results show that the compression performance of our proposed method is comparable to those of H.264, HEVC in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM."

These tasks hold clues to each-others solutions, however as these relations can be complex this remains a rarely utilized property. When task relations are explicitly defined based on domain knowledge multi-task learning (MTL) offers such concurrent solutions, while exploiting relatedness between multiple tasks performed over the same dataset. In most cases however, this relatedness is not explicitly defined and the domain expert knowledge that defines it is not available. To address this issue, we introduce Selective Sharing, a method that learns the inter-task relatedness from secondary latent features while the model trains. Using this insight, we can automatically group tasks and allow them to share knowledge in a mutually beneficial way. We support our method with experiments on 5 datasets in classification, regression, and ranking tasks and compare to strong baselines and state-of-the-art approaches showing a consistent improvement in terms of accuracy and parameter counts. In addition, we perform an activation region analysis showing how Selective Sharing affects the learned representation."

Frequency-related constraints, namely the limitation on Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency (RoCoF), frequency nadir and steady-state frequency error, are derived from a uniform system frequency response model and included into a stochastic UC that accounts for wind power and equipment contingency uncertainties using a scenario-tree approach. In contrast to the linear RoCoF and steady-state frequency error constraints, the nadir constraint is highly nonlinear. To preserve the mixed-integer linear formulation of the stochastic UC model, we propose a computationally efficient approach that allows to recast the nadir constraint by introducing appropriate bounds on relevant decision variables of the UC model. For medium-sized networks, this method is shown to be computationally more efficient than a piece-wise linearization method adapted from the literature. Simulation results for a modified IEEE RTS-96 system revealed that the inclusion of inertia-related constraints significantly influences the UC decisions and increases total costs, as more synchronous machines are forced to be online to provide inertial response."

This substantially complicates construction of an accurate model for such systems using data-driven approaches. The present paper illustrates how physical constraints can be employed to overcome this limitation using the example of a weakly turbulent quasi-two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow driven by a steady Lorenz force with an unknown spatial profile. Specifically, the terms involving latent variables in the partial differential equations governing the dynamics can be eliminated at the expense of raising the order of that equation. We show that local polynomial interpolation combined with symbolic regression can handle sparse data on grids that are representative of typical experimental measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry. However, we also find that the reconstructed model is sensitive to measurement noise and trace this sensitivity to the presence of high order spatial and/or temporal derivatives."

The N$_2$ evolution rate was observed to decrease with increasing reaction time and was found to be correlated with a decrease in O$_2$ evolution (OER) activity, the origin of this latter effect however being unknown. Here we investigate, by means of density functional theory calculation, anion vacancies at the TaON-terminated (001) surface of the perovskite oxynitride SrTaO$_2$N. We find an energetic preference for oxygen and nitrogen vacancies to reside at the surface, where they are spontaneously healed by *O and *OH adsorbates under OER conditions. For nitrogen vacancies, this self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta$_4$O$_{8+x}$N$_{4-x}$ that is accompanied by electron doping. Substitution of N by O at the surface also leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very surface layer, affecting the binding energy of reaction intermediates and significantly increasing the OER overpotential. This peculiar change in electronic structure thus provides an atomic scale explanation for the experimentally observed drop in OER activity of perovskite oxynitrides."

The starting point for all our results is a sampling procedure for asymptotically uniform square permutations. Building on that, we first describe the global behavior by showing that these permutations have a permuton limit which can be described by a random rectangle. We also explore fluctuations about this random rectangle, which we can describe through coupled Brownian motions. Second, we consider the limiting behavior of the neighborhood of a point in the permutation through local limits. As a byproduct, we also determine the random limits of the proportion of occurrences (and consecutive occurrences) of any given pattern in a uniform random square permutation."

In the optical range of the spectrum, a possible signature of the accretion disc is the presence of a broad double-peaked component that is mostly seen in H$\alpha$. In this paper, we report the detection of a double-peaked feature in the H$\alpha$ line in the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 4958. The narrow line region of this object has an emission that is typical of a LINER galaxy, which is the usual classification for double-peaked emitters. A central broad component, related to the broad line region (BLR) of this object, is seen in H$\alpha$ and also in H$\beta$. We concluded that the double-peaked emission is emitted by a circular relativistic Keplerian disc with an inner radius $\xi_{\rm i}$ = 570$\pm$ 83, an outer radius $\xi_{\rm o}$ = 860$\pm$170 (both in units of $GM_{\rm SMBH}/c^2$), an inclination to the line of sight $i$ = 27.2$^o \pm$0.7$^o$ and a local broadening parameter $\sigma$ = 1310$\pm$70 km s$^{-1}$."

In particular, truncations of the crossing equation with even a handful of components can lead to extremely accurate results, in opposition to hundreds of components in the usual approach.

In this approach, the $\Delta(1600)$ is an analogue of the Roper resonance in the nucleon sector, appearing as the simplest radial excitation of the $\Delta(1232)$. Precise measurements of the $\gamma^\ast p \to \Delta^+(1232)$ transition already exist on $0 \leq Q^2 \lesssim 8\,$GeV$^2$ and the calculated results compare favourably with the data outside the meson-cloud domain. The predictions for the $\gamma^\ast p \to \Delta^+(1600)$ magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition form factors are consistent with the empirical values at the real photon point, and extend to $Q^2 \approx 6 m_p^2$, enabling a meaningful direct comparison with experiment once analysis of existing data is completed. In both cases, the electric quadrupole form factor is particularly sensitive to deformation of the $\Delta$-baryons. Interestingly, whilst the $\gamma^\ast p \to \Delta^+(1232)$ transition form factors are larger in magnitude than those for $\gamma^\ast p \to \Delta^+(1600)$ in some neighbourhood of the real photon point, this ordering is reversed on $Q^2 \gtrsim 2 m_p^2$, suggesting that the $\gamma^\ast p \to \Delta^+(1600)$ transition is more localised in configuration space."

With high velocity and responsiveness on team-level come the risk of interpersonal conflict in the agile organizations. Through a survey with 68 software developers from three large Swedish companies, I found that the presence of interpersonal conflict was negatively connected to the agile practices Iterative Development and Customer Access. The agile practices Iteration Planning and Iterative Development were positively linked to the measurement of the developers' perceived team productivity. However, Continuous Integration & Testing was negatively connected to productivity. These results show which agile practices are directly linked to team productivity, but also, and more importantly, indicate which of the agile practices that might be more prone to not work as intended, when the team struggles with interpersonal conflict. Therefore, I argue that members of agile teams need training in conflict resolution techniques in order to lower the risk of interpersonal conflict negatively affecting team productivity."

This small length scale indicates that, instead of artificial phononic crystals, a more promising direction is to examine the coherent phonon effects in natural materials with hierarchical superstructures matching the thermal phonon wavelength. In this work, we use first-principles simulations to characterize the previously unstudied thermal properties of D-graphene and T-graphene, two-dimensional carbon allotropes based upon the traditional graphene structure but containing a secondary, in-plane periodicity. We find that despite very similar atomic structure and bonding strength, D-graphene and T-graphene possess significantly different thermal properties than that of pristine graphene. At room temperature, the calculated thermal conductivity of D-graphene and T-graphene is 600 Wm-1K-1 and 800 Wm-1K-1 compared to over 3000 Wm-1K-1 for graphene. We attribute these distinct properties to the presence of naturally occurring, low frequency optical phonon modes that display characteristics of phonon coherence and arise from a folding of the acoustic modes and the associated frequency gap opening, a phenomenon also found in superlattices where an out of plane periodicity is introduced. Furthermore, we observe significantly enhanced Umklapp scatterings in D- and T-graphene that largely suppress the hydrodynamic phonon transport in pristine graphene. Our study presents D-graphene and T-graphene as ideal model systems to explore the coherent phonon effects in 2D and demonstrates the potential of using coherent phonon effects to significantly modify thermal transport of 2D materials without making drastic changes to their fundamental compositions."

In this review we discuss the mass feeding mechanisms that lead to this growth in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), focusing on constraints derived from observations of their environment, from extragalactic down to galactic and nuclear scales. At high AGN luminosities, galaxy mergers and interactions play an important role in AGN triggering and feeding. However, gas chaotic cold accretion (CCA) in galaxy clusters can trigger radiatively inefficient AGNs in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). At lower luminosities, minor mergers feed AGN in early-type, gas-starving galaxies, while secular processes dominate in later-type, gas-rich galaxies. While bars do not appear to directly feed AGNs, AGN flickering leads to the dissociation of small and large scales, hence affecting the interpretation of cause and effect. At ~ 100 pc scales, recent observations have revealed compact disks and inflows along nuclear gaseous spirals and bars, while CCA continues to feed BCGs at these scales. Estimated mass inflow rates - of 0.01 to a few Msun/yr - are in many cases thousand times higher than the mass accretion rate to the supermassive black hole. As a result, 10^6 - 10^9 Msun gas reservoirs can be built on 10^{7-8} yr, that in turn may lead to the formation of new stars and/or be ejected via the onset of AGN feedback."

Recent paleomagnetic evidence indicates that the nucleation of Earth's inner core, followed perhaps by an increase in geomagnetic field strength, might have occurred close to the Ediacaran period. Motivated by this putative discovery, we explore the ensuing ramifications from the growth or reversals of Earth's dynamo. By reviewing and synthesizing emerging quantitative models, it is proposed that neither the biological radiation dose rates nor the atmospheric escape rates would vary by more than a factor of $\sim 2$ under these circumstances. Hence, we suggest that hypotheses seeking to explain the Cambrian radiation or mass extinctions via changes in Earth's magnetic field intensity are potentially unlikely. We also briefly discuss how variations in the planetary magnetic field may have impacted early Mars and could influence exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs."

Here, we demonstrate a new approach to solid state synaptic transistors using two dimensional MoS2 floating gate memories. By using an extended floating gate architecture which allows the device to be operated at near-ideal subthreshold swing of 77 mV/decade over four decades of drain current, we have realised a charge tunneling based synaptic memory with performance comparable to the state of the art in neuromorphic designs. The device successfully demonstrates various features of a biological synapse, including pulsed potentiation and relaxation of channel conductance, as well as spike time dependent plasticity (STDP). Our device returns excellent energy efficiency figures and provides a robust platform based on ultrathin two dimensional nanosheets for future neuromorphic applications."

However, as a fundamental scene understanding task, surface normal estimation from RGB-D data lacks thorough investigation. In this paper, a hierarchical fusion network with adaptive feature re-weighting is proposed for surface normal estimation from a single RGB-D image. Specifically, the features from color image and depth are successively integrated at multiple scales to ensure global surface smoothness while preserving visually salient details. Meanwhile, the depth features are re-weighted with a confidence map estimated from depth before merging into the color branch to avoid artifacts caused by input depth corruption. Additionally, a hybrid multi-scale loss function is designed to learn accurate normal estimation given noisy ground-truth dataset. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the fusion strategy and the loss design, outperforming state-of-the-art normal estimation schemes."

It is shown that in the presence of magnetization dynamics such systems become inherently dissipative and in principle cannot sustain any amount of the superconducting current because of the voltage generated by the magnetization dynamics. We calculate generic current-voltage characteristics of a superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction with an unpinned domain wall and find the low-current resistance associated with the domain wall motion. We suggest the finite slope of Shapiro steps as the characteristic feature of the regime with domain wall oscillations driven by the ac external current flowing through the junction.

If $G$ is a finite graph covered by $X$, it is said to be $X$-Ramanujan if its second-largest eigenvalue $\lambda_2(G)$ is at most the spectral radius $\rho(X)$ of $X$, and more generally $k$-quasi-$X$-Ramanujan if $\lambda_k(G)$ is at most $\rho(X)$. In case $X$ is the infinite $\Delta$-regular tree, this reduces to the well known notion of a finite $\Delta$-regular graph being Ramanujan. Inspired by the Interlacing Polynomials method of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava, we show the existence of infinitely many $k$-quasi-$X$-Ramanujan graphs for a variety of infinite $X$. In particular, $X$ need not be a tree; our analysis is applicable whenever $X$ is what we call an additive product graph. This additive product is a new construction of an infinite graph $\mathsf{AddProd}(A_1, \dots, A_c)$ from finite 'atom' graphs $A_1, \dots, A_c$ over a common vertex set. It generalizes the notion of the free product graph $A_1 * \cdots * A_c$ when the atoms $A_j$ are vertex-transitive, and it generalizes the notion of the universal covering tree when the atoms $A_j$ are single-edge graphs. Key to our analysis is a new graph polynomial $\alpha(A_1, \dots, A_c;x)$ that we call the additive characteristic polynomial. It generalizes the well known matching polynomial $\mu(G;x)$ in case the atoms $A_j$ are the single edges of $G$, and it generalizes the $r$-characteristic polynomial introduced in [Ravichandran'16, Leake-Ravichandran'18]. We show that $\alpha(A_1, \dots, A_c;x)$ is real-rooted, and all of its roots have magnitude at most $\rho(\mathsf{AddProd}(A_1, \dots, A_c))$. This last fact is proven by generalizing Godsil's notion of treelike walks on a graph $G$ to a notion of freelike walks on a collection of atoms $A_1, \dots, A_c$."

In this paper, we present a robust registration method based on building regions, which are extracted from optical images using mean shift segmentation, and from LiDAR data using a 3D point cloud filtering process. The matching of the extracted building segments is then carried out using Graph Transformation Matching (GTM) which allows to determine a common pattern of relative positions of segment centers. Thanks to this registration, the relative shifts between the data sets are significantly reduced, which enables a subsequent fine registration and a resulting high-quality data fusion."

As both phenomena are intimately related to electron-lattice interaction, a natural question is how superconductivity and CDW are interrelated through electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which is important to the understanding of 2-dimensional superconductivity. This work investigates the superconductivity of monolayer NbSe2 in CDW phase using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism based on first principles calculations. The mechanism of the competition between and coexistence of the superconductivity and CDW is studied in detail by analyzing EPC. It is found that the intra-pocket scattering is related to superconductivity, leading to almost constant value of superconducting gaps on parts of the Fermi surface. The inter-pocket scattering is found to be responsible for CDW, leading to partial or full bandgap on the remaining Fermi surface. Recent experiment indicates that there is transitioning from regular superconductivity in thin-film NbSe2 to two-gap superconductivity in the bulk, which is shown here to have its origin in the extent of Fermi surface gapping of K and K' pockets induced by CDW. Overall blue shifts of the phonons and sharp decrease of Eliashberg spectrum are found when the CDW forms."

In the limit of zero cosmological constant, the set of nonlinear partial differential equations characterizing this ECW structure reduces correctly to that of a hyper-CR Einstein-Weyl structure in the Gauduchon gauge, which was shown by Dunajski, Gutowski and Sabra to be the horizon geometry in the ungauged BPS case."

However, national CO2 emissions are reported by individual countries, and cannot be directly measured or verified by third parties. This engenders a potential misreporting problem, where nations that are not living up to their Paris commitments could, by under-reporting emissions, nevertheless appear to be fulfilling their NDC targets. This paper uses the theory of sequential testing to design a statistical CO2 monitoring procedure, that can detect systematic misreportings of CO2 emissions. The data series that we monitor is the so-called carbon budget imbalance, which is a time series derived from reported CO2 emissions and independently measured Earth system data. We show that, when emissions are truthfully reported, the budget imbalance constitutes a stationary process, while, if emissions become systematically misreported, a structural break occurs. Our proposed procedure monitors the budget imbalance data and sequentially tests the null that the budget imbalance is stationary; rejection of the null provides evidence for systematic misreportings of CO2 emissions. By constructing the procedure appropriately, detection time can be made sufficiently fast to help inform the 5 yearly global ""stocktake"" of the Paris Agreement."

By focusing on this simple story, which can be easily simulated on a computer, I aim to provide a more accessible and intuitive presentation of the Boltzmann distribution. Yet I hope this exposition also inspires deep thinking about statistical physics. For instance, I show that the coconuts and islanders story illuminates a connection between the ""fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics""---all microstates are equally probable---and the statistical property of detailed balance."

A major unsolved research challenge is to design theorem provers that are ""reasonably complete"" even in the presence of free function symbols ranging into a background theory sort. The hierarchic superposition calculus of Bachmair, Ganzinger, and Waldmann already supports such symbols, but, as we demonstrate, not optimally. This paper aims to rectify the situation by introducing a novel form of clause abstraction, a core component in the hierarchic superposition calculus for transforming clauses into a form needed for internal operation. We argue for the benefits of the resulting calculus and provide two new completeness results: one for the fragment where all background-sorted terms are ground and another one for a special case of linear (integer or rational) arithmetic as a background theory."

However, the extent and manner in which atomic environment signatures present in the undeformed structure determine this plastic heterogeneity remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that novel site environment features that characterize interstice distributions around atoms combined with machine learning (ML) can reliably identify plastic sites in several Cu-Zr compositions. Using only quenched structural information as input, the ML-based plastic probability estimates (""quench-in softness"" metric) can identify plastic sites that could activate at high strains, losing predictive power only upon the formation of shear bands. Moreover, we reveal that a quench-in softness model trained on a single composition and quenching rate substantially improves upon previous models in generalizing to different compositions and completely different MG systems (Ni62Nb38, Al90Sm10 and Fe80P20). Our work presents a general, data-centric framework that could potentially be used to address the structural origin of any site-specific property in MGs."

We numerically explore the motion of the test particle by presenting color-coded diagrams, where the initial conditions are mapped to the orbit type and studied as a function of the total orbital energy, the initial value of the $z$-coordinate and the oblateness coefficient. The fraction of the collision orbits, measured on the color-coded diagrams, show an algebraic dependence on the oblateness coefficient, which can be derived by simple semi-theoretical arguments."

We construct an algebraic symplectic form on ${\mathcal M}_X(G)$ with the property that the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence pulls back to the Goldman symplectic form to it. Therefore, despite the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence being non-algebraic, the pullback of the Goldman symplectic form by the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence nevertheless continues to be algebraic."

Here we fabricate and study experimentally nano-scale Superconductor/ Ferromagnet/Superconductor junctions with the high-Tc cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 and the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganite ferromagnets LaXMnO3 (X: Ca or Sr). We demonstrate that in a broad temperature range the magnetization of a manganite nanoparticle, forming the junction interface, switches abruptly in a mono-domain manner. The CMR phenomenon translates the magnetization loop into a hysteretic magnetoresistance loop. The latter facilitates a memory functionality of such a junction with just a single CMR ferromagnetic layer. The orientation of the magnetization (stored information) can be read out by simply measuring the junction resistance in an applied magnetic field. The CMR facilitates a large read-out signal in a small applied field. We argue that such a simple single layer CMR junction can operate as a memory cell both in the superconducting state at cryogenic temperatures and in the normal state up to room temperature."

To start with the oscillators are considered as uncoupled but interlinked through either a common microwave current or a microwave field. We identify the phase locking of an array of STNOs (first for two and then for 100 oscillators) by means of injection locking which represents locking the oscillations to a common alternating spin current or a common microwave magnetic field. We characterize the locking of STNOs through both first and second harmonic lockings in an array. We find that second harmonic lockings takes lesser value of microwave current and field when compared with the first harmonic lockings. Our results also show that oscillating microwave current can induce integer harmonic locking while microwave field can induce both integer and several fractional harmonic lockings. We also extend our analysis to study locking behavior of two STNOs by introducing time delay feedback and coupling through a current injection and bring out the associated locking characteristics. Finally, we have also analyzed the stability of synchronization of identical array of STNOs with current coupling by using master stability function formalism."

The ideal strengths and critical strains for these 2D materials are investigated under uniaxial and equibiaxial strains. It is found that the ideal strengths decrease significantly as the atomic number increases, while the critical strains change not so much. In particular, the ideal strength of antimonene along armchair direction is found to exceed Griffith strength limit. The distributions of charge density, buckling heights, bond lengths, and bond angles are also studied under different types of strains. It can be concluded that the critical strain is determined by the stretch and rotation of bonds simultaneously. Furthermore, the phonon dispersions, phonon instabilities, and failure mechanism of these materials under three types of strains are also calculated and explored."

It is argued that excesses with respect to the Standard Model prediction should be observed in all final states (0, 1 or 2 leptons), with the 1-lepton final state being the strongest. Since the relative strengths of these excesses depend on branching ratios and efficiencies, this is a clear signal for the presence of heavy resonances or their low mass tails. A general vector-triplet model is used to explore the discovery potential as a function of the resonance mass and width. Recent Higgs to $b\bar{b}$ observation data reported by the experiments ATLAS and CMS are used to test the model. Current limits are extended to resonance widths over mass as large as 9%."

Using these results we discuss the current of a Dirac particle to discuss the polarization densities and the magnetization density in the context of Gordon decomposition method. In this work we also calculate the total polarization and magnetization, to investigate that the magnetic field how can effect on the particle production.

The examples of unfree gauge symmetries include volume preserving diffeomorphisms in the unimodular gravity and various higher spin field theories with transverse gauge symmetries. All the known examples of the models with unfree gauge symmetry share one common feature. They admit local quantities which vanish on shell, though they are not linear combinations of Lagrangian equations and their derivatives. We term these quantities as mass shell completion functions.   In the case of usual gauge symmetry with unconstrained gauge parameters, the irreducible gauge algebra involves the two basic constituents: the action functional and gauge symmetry generators. For the case of unfree gauge symmetry, we identify two more basic constituents: operators of gauge parameter constraints and completion functions. These two extra constituents are involved in the algebra of unfree gauge symmetry on equal footing with action and gauge symmetry generators.   Proceeding from the algebra, we adjust the Faddeev-Popov (FP) path integral quantization scheme to the case of unfree gauge symmetry. The modified FP action involves the operators of the constraints imposed on the gauge parameters, while the corresponding BRST transformation involves the completion functions. The BRST symmetry ensures gauge independence of the path integral. We provide two examples which admit the alternative unconstrained parametrization of gauge symmetry and demonstrate that they lead to the equivalent FP path integral."

Atomic-level transitions are used to transform and translate objects, to split objects and to merge them together. This gradually constructs a database of atomic configurations -- a set of relevant defect objects and their possible events generated on-the-fly. Elastic interactions are handled within objects with empirical potentials at short distances, and between spatially distinct objects using the dipole tensor formalism. The model is shown to evolve mobile interstitial clusters in tungsten faster than an equivalent molecular dynamics simulation, even at elevated temperatures. We apply the model to the evolution of complex defects generated using molecular dynamics simulations of primary radiation damage in tungsten. We show that we can evolve defect structures formed in cascade simulations to experimentally observable timescales of seconds while retaining atomistic detail. We conclude that the first few nanoseconds of simulation following cascade initiation would be better performed using molecular dynamics, as this will capture some of the near-temperature-independent evolution of small highly-mobile interstitial clusters. We also conclude that, for the 20keV PKA cascades annealing simulations considered here, internal relaxations of sessile objects difficult to capture using conventional object KMC with idealised object geometries establish the conditions for long timescale evolution."

Here we extend the sub-grid-scale gradient model, so far used in the momentum and induction equations, to account also for the unresolved scales in the energy evolution equation of a compressible ideal MHD fluid with a generic equation of state. We assess the model by considering box simulations of the turbulence triggered across a shear layer by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, testing cases where the small-scale dynamics cannot be fully captured by the resolution considered, such that the efficiency of the simulated dynamo effect depends on the resolution employed. This lack of numerical convergence is actually a currently common issue in several astrophysical problems, where the integral and fastest-growing-instability scales are too far apart to be fully covered numerically. We perform a-priori and a-posteriori tests of the extended gradient model. In the former, we find that, for many different initial conditions and resolutions, the gradient model outperforms other commonly used models in terms of correlation with the residuals coming from the filtering of a high-resolution run. In the second test, we show how a low-resolution run with the gradient model is able to quantitatively reproduce the evolution of the magnetic energy (the integrated value and the spectral distribution) coming from higher-resolution runs. This extension is the first step towards the implementation in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics."

At the same time the intrinsic distinction introduced by $U(2)$ between the third and the first two families of quarks and leptons may support anomalies in charged and neutral current semi-leptonic $B$-decays of the kind tentatively observed in current flavour experiments. We show how this is possible by the exchange of the $(3,1)_{2/3}$ vector leptoquark in two $U(2)$-models with significantly different values of Lepton Flavour Universality violation, observable in foreseen experiments."

Controlling error fields during coil fabrication and assembly is crucial for stellarators. Excessively tight coil tolerance increases time and cost, and, in part, led to the cancellation of NCSX and delay of W7-X. In this paper, we improve the recently proposed Hessian matrix method to rapidly identify important coil deviations. Two of the most common figures of merit, magnetic island size and quasi-symmetry, are analytically differentiated over coil parameters. By extracting the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, we can directly identify sensitive coil deviations in the order of the eigenvalues. The new method is applied to the upcoming CFQS configuration. Important perturbations that enlarge n/m=4/11 islands and deteriorate quasi-axisymmetry of the magnetic field are successfully determined. The results suggest each modular coil should have separate tolerance and some certain perturbation combinations will produce significant error fields. By relaxing unnecessary coil tolerance, this method will hopefully lead to a substantial reduction in time and cost."

We adopt a compact parametric 3D hand model that represents deformable and articulated hand meshes. To achieve the model fitting to RGB images, we investigate and contribute in three ways: 1) Neural rendering: inspired by recent work on human body, our hand mesh estimator (HME) is implemented by a neural network and a differentiable renderer, supervised by 2D segmentation masks and 3D skeletons. HME demonstrates good performance for estimating diverse hand shapes and improves pose estimation accuracies. 2) Iterative testing refinement: Our fitting function is differentiable. We iteratively refine the initial estimate using the gradients, in the spirit of iterative model fitting methods like ICP. The idea is supported by the latest research on human body. 3) Self-data augmentation: collecting sized RGB-mesh (or segmentation mask)-skeleton triplets for training is a big hurdle. Once the model is successfully fitted to input RGB images, its meshes i.e. shapes and articulations, are realistic, and we augment view-points on top of estimated dense hand poses. Experiments using three RGB-based benchmarks show that our framework offers beyond state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation, as well as recovers dense 3D hand shapes. Each technical component above meaningfully improves the accuracy in the ablation study."

Assume that there are sets with common points, and moreover the pairwise correspondences are known for such sets. We consider a least-squares formulation of this problem, where the variables are the transforms associated with the point sets. The present novelty is that we reduce this nonconvex problem to an optimization over the positive semidefinite cone, where the objective is linear but the constraints are nevertheless nonconvex. We propose to solve this using variable splitting and the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM). Due to the linearity of the objective and the structure of constraints, the ADMM subproblems are given by projections with closed-form solutions. In particular, for $m$ point sets, the dominant cost per iteration is the partial eigendecomposition of an $md \times md$ matrix, and $m-1$ singular value decompositions of $d \times d$ matrices. We empirically show that for appropriate parameter settings, the proposed solver has a large convergence basin and is stable under perturbations. As applications, we use our method for $2$D shape matching and $3$D multiview registration. In either application, we model the shapes/scans as point sets and determine the pairwise correspondences using ICP. In particular, our algorithm compares favorably with existing methods for multiview reconstruction in terms of timing and accuracy."

In the speech community, transcription of speech recording is indispensable. Since the transcription is usually generated artificially, automatically finding errors in manual transcriptions not only saves time and labors but benefits the performance of tasks that need the training process. Inspired by the success of hybrid automatic speech recognition using both language model and acoustic model, two approaches of automatic error detection in the transcriptions have been explored in this work. Previous study using a biased language model approach, relying on a strong transcription-dependent language model, has been reviewed. In this work, we propose a novel acoustic model based approach, focusing on the phonetic sequence of speech. Both methods have been evaluated on a completely real dataset, which was originally transcribed with errors and strictly corrected manually afterwards."

For correct expansion of organs that primarily grow by elongating, such as roots and stems, MTs must bend in the high-curvature direction along the cylindrically shaped cell membrane in order to form the required circumferential arrays. Computational studies, which have recapitulated the self-organization of these arrays, ignored MT mechanics and assumed MTs follow geodesics of the cell surface. Here, we show, through analysis of a derived Euler-Lagrange equation, that an elastic MT constrained to a cylindrical surface will deflect away from geodesics and toward low curvature directions to minimize bending energy. This occurs when the curvature of the cell surface is relatively high for a given anchor density. In the limit of infinite anchor density, MTs always follow geodesics. We compare our analytical predictions to measured curvatures and anchor densities and find that the regime in which cells are forming these cortical arrays straddles the region of parameter space in which arrays must form under the antagonistic influence of this mechanically induced deflection. Although this introduces a potential obstacle to forming circumferentially orientated arrays that needs to be accounted for in the models, it also raises the question of whether plants use this mechanical phenomenon to regulate array orientation. The model also constitutes an elegant generalization of the classical Euler-bucking instability along with an intrinsic unfolding of the associated pitchfork bifurcation."

In this short note, we aim to refine some recent work demonstrating the success of the RT formula in TT deformed theories.

On the other hand, collecting low resolution labels (labels for a block of pixels) for these high resolution images is much more cost efficient. Conventional methods trained on these low-resolution labels are only capable of giving low-resolution predictions. The existing state-of-the-art label super resolution (LSR) method is capable of predicting high resolution labels, using only low-resolution supervision, given the joint distribution between low resolution and high resolution labels. However, it does not consider the inter-instance variance which is crucial in the ideal mathematical formulation. In this work, we propose a novel loss function modeling the inter-instance variance. We test our method on a real world application: infiltrating breast cancer region segmentation in histopathology slides. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method."

The setting of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime is adopted for most of the paper, but in the framework of canonical quantum gravity, without invoking AdS/CFT duality. We present Marolf's argument that boundary unitarity is a consequence of diffeomorphism invariance, and show that its failure to apply in the classical limit results from a lack of analyticity that has no quantum counterpart. We argue that boundary unitarity leads to a {\it boundary information paradox}, which generalizes the black hole information paradox and arises in virtually any scattering process. We propose a resolution that involves operators of the boundary algebra that redundantly encode information about physics in the bulk, and explain why such redundancy need not violate the algebraic no cloning theorem. We also argue that the infaller paradox, which has motivated the firewall hypothesis for black hole horizons, is ill-posed in quantum gravity, because it ignores essential aspects of the nature of the Hilbert space and observables in quantum gravity."

Such a phase is not involved with any spontaneous symmetry breaking and local order parameter, and to understand it is beyond the conventional phase transition theory. Due to the rich physics and exotic properties of quantum spin liquids, such as the long-range entanglement and fractional quantum excitations, which are believed to hold great potentials in quantum communication and computation, they have been intensively studied since the concept was proposed in 1973 by P. W. Anderson. Currently, experimental identifications of a quantum spin liquid still remain as a great challenge. Here, we highlight some interesting experimental progress that has been made recently. We also discuss some outstanding issues and raise questions that we consider to be important for future research."

This property is named as the Lebesgue property. Though the Lebesgue property may be breakdown in many infinite dimensional spaces including Banach or quasi Banach spaces, to determine spaces having this property is still an interesting problem. In this paper, we study Riemann integration for vector-value functions in metrizable vector spaces and prove the fundamental theorems of calculus and primitives for continuous functions. Further we discovery that $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$, the countable infinite product of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself equipped with the product topology, is a metrizable vector space having the Lebesgue property and prove that $l^p(1<p\leq+\infty)$, as subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$, possess the Lebesgue property although they are Banach spaces having no such property."

The study of this family of materials has been at the frontiers of condensed matter physics, and many breakthroughs have been made. Several topological semimetal phases, including Dirac semimetals (DSMs), Weyl semimetals (WSMs), nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), and triple-point semimetals, have been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated. The low-energy excitation around the Dirac/Weyl nodal points, nodal line, or triply degenerated nodal point can be viewed as emergent relativistic fermions. Experimental studies have shown that relativistic fermions can result in a rich variety of exotic transport properties, e.g., extremely large magnetoresistance, the chiral anomaly, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. In this review, we first briefly introduce band structural characteristics of each topological semimetal phase, then review the current studies on quantum oscillations and exotic transport properties of various topological semimetals, and finally provide a perspective of this area."

The aim of this paper is to proof quantitatively this prediction. In order to construct an inhomogeneous medium we distort the original FCC crystal to produce a phase of planar structures made of skyrmions. We implement mathematically these planar structures by means of the 't Hooft instanton solution using the Atiyah-Manton ansatz. The results of our calculation of the average density and energy confirm the prediction suggesting that the phase diagram of the dense skyrmion matter is a lot more complex than a simple phase transition from the skyrmion FCC crystal lattice to the half-skyrmion CC one. Our results show that skyrmion matter shares common properties with standard nuclear matter developing a skin and leading to a binding energy equation which resembles the Weiszaecker mass formula.

Subwavelength bandgap phononic crystals are typically created using a periodic arrangement of subwavelength resonators, in our case small gas bubbles in a liquid. In this work, a waveguide is created by modifying the sizes of the bubbles along a line in a dilute two-dimensional bubbly crystal, thereby creating a line defect. Our aim is to prove that the line defect indeed acts as a waveguide; waves of certain frequencies will be localized to, and guided along, the line defect. The key result is an original formula for the frequencies of the defect modes. Moreover, these frequencies are numerically computed using the multipole method, which numerically illustrates our main results."

Novel electronic implementations of quantum optics devices are now available with perspectives such as 'flying' qubit manipulations. However, electronic quantum interferences in conductors remained up to now limited to propagation paths shorter than $30\,\mu$m, independently of the material. Here we demonstrate strong electronic quantum interferences after a propagation along two $0.1\,$mm long pathways in a circuit. Interferences of visibility as high as $80\%$ and $40\%$ are observed on electronic analogues of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer of, respectively, $24\,\mu$m and $0.1\,$mm arm length, consistently corresponding to a $0.25\,$mm electronic phase coherence length. While such devices perform best in the integer quantum Hall regime at filling factor 2, the electronic interferences are restricted by the Coulomb interaction between copropagating edge channels. We overcome this limitation by closing the inner channel in micron-scale loops of frozen internal degrees of freedom, combined with a loop-closing strategy providing an essential isolation from the environment."

The related works that have so far been presented by various research groups in the field have been collected in this review, which in the presented comparative procedure here shows the progress of this field during the time. Microfluidic technology as a pioneer field in bioengineering needs to have some active components likes pumps, valves, and mixers to obtain efficient functionality. Most of the conventional microfluidic active components are challenging to assemble and control outside the laboratory since they need some special facilities, which is not cost-effective. This is while some of the main targets of the microfluidic devices are for the development of point of care (POC) diagnostic systems, home usability, ubiquitousness, and low-cost ability. To solve these problems, i-EAPs have shown promising features to be the proper candidates as active elements of the microfluidic devices. Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs), Conducting polymer actuators (CPAs), and Ionic carbon nanotube-based actuators (i-CNTAs) are three main types of the i-EAPs. In this paper, the working principles, fabrication, and microfluidic-based applications of these three categories are described in details. To have a proper comparison between all the reported i-EAP based microfluidic devices, several important features, i.e., applied voltage/frequency, device materials, electrode material, membrane material, and the main measured index of each device, have been reviewed."

In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape.   First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2.5 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body, we annotate the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks.   We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete.   Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic validation and on the wild images."

First, we present an analytical model for estimating the total variance in the image space for directed or diffusive motion of microparticles and show that this measure is correlated to the density and speed of the particles. The analytical model was found to have good agreement with numerical simulations for low particle density. Then, using only the local image variance we obtain the magnitude and direction of the particle velocity in a rectangular microfluidic channel, closely matching the theoretical profile. Further, we also demonstrate the application of this method as a probe for particle-surface interactions by extracting the differences in distribution and time-evolution of image variance from mobile microparticles adhering to different surfaces. We believe that the image variance based method described here presents an addition to the suite of tracking-free techniques such as Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) to extract motility parameters from video data."

Based on our variational problem formulation \cite{Lebiedz2011} for slow invariant manifold (SIM) computation and ideas from general relativity theory we argue for a coordinate free analysis treatment \cite{Heiter2018} and a differential geometry formulation in terms of geodesic flows \cite{Poppe2019}. In particular, we propose analytic continuation of the dynamical system to the complex time domain to reveal deeper structures and allow the application of the rich toolbox of Fourier and complex analysis to the SIM problem."

The nearby edge-on galaxy NGC 891 has a multi-component gaseous halo and a background AGN (LQAC 035+042 003) projected 5 kpc above the disk near the minor axis. Against the UV continuum of this AGN, we detect lines from 13 ions associated with NGC 891 in new {\it HST}/COS spectra. Most of the absorption is from the warm ionized gas with $\log T=4.22\pm0.04$, $\log n_{\rm H}=-1.26\pm0.51$, and $\log N_{\rm H}=20.81\pm 0.20$. The metallicity of volatile elements (i.e., C, N, and S) is about half solar ($\rm[X/H] \approx -0.3\pm 0.3$), while Mg, Fe, and Ni show lower metallicities of $\rm[X/H]\approx-0.9$. The absorption system shows the depletion pattern seen for warm Galactic diffuse clouds, which is consistent with a mixture of ejected solar metallicity disk gases and the hot X-ray emitting halo ($Z=0.1-0.2Z_\odot$). The warm ionized gases are about 5 times more massive than the cold \ion{H}{1} emitting gases around the galactic center, which might lead to accretion with a mean rate of $10^2~M_\odot\rm~yr^{-1}$ for a period of time. We also detect low metallicity ($\approx 0.1~Z_\odot$) gases toward LQAC 035+042 003 at $110\rm~km~s^{-1}$ (a high velocity cloud) and toward another sight line (3C 66A; 108 kpc projected from NGC 891) at $30\rm~km~s^{-1}$. This low metallicity material could be the cold mode accretion from IGM or the tidal disruption of satellites in the NGC 891 halo."

It is seen in general that the error bounds are determined by the conditional entropy of the data point to be estimated or predicted given the side information or past observations. Additionally, we discover that in order to achieve the prediction error bounds asymptotically, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the ""innovation"" is asymptotically white Gaussian. When restricted to Gaussian processes and 1-step prediction, our bounds are shown to reduce to the Kolmogorov-Szeg\""o formula and Wiener-Masani formula known from linear prediction theory."

For TeV-scale seesaw models, successful leptogenesis requires that the right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) must be quasi-degenerate and if they have CP violating phases, they also contribute to the CP asymmetry. We investigate this in the TeV-scale left-right models for seesaw and point out a way to probe the quasi-degeneracy possibility with CP violating mixings for RHNs in hadron colliders using simple observables constructed out of same-sign dilepton charge asymmetry (SSCA). In particular, we isolate the parameter regions of the model, where the viability of leptogenesis can be tested using the SSCA at the Large Hadron Collider, as well as future 27 TeV and 100 TeV hadron colliders. We also independently confirm an earlier result that there is a generic lower bound on the $W_R$ mass of about 10 TeV for leptogenesis to work."

Amongst the cubic systems, for example, tetragonally distorted Mn$_{3}$Pt exhibits an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE). However, Mn$_{3}$Pt only enters a non-collinear magnetic phase close to the stoichiometric composition and at suitably large thicknesses. Therefore, we turn our attention to Mn$_{3}$Ir, the material of choice for use in exchange bias heterostructures. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic and electrical transport properties of epitaxially grown, face-centered-cubic $\gamma$-Mn$_{3}$Ir thin films with (111) crystal orientation. Relaxed films of 10 nm thickness exhibit an ordinary Hall effect, with a hole-type carrier concentration of (2.24 $\pm$ 0.08) $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-3}$. On the other hand, TEM characterization demonstrates that ultrathin 3 nm films grow with significant in-plane tensile strain. This may explain a small remanent moment, observed at low temperatures, shown by XMCD spectroscopy to arise from uncompensated Mn spins. Of the order 0.02 $\mu_{B}$ / atom, this dominates electrical transport behavior, leading to a small AHE and negative magnetoresistance. These results are discussed in terms of crystal microstructure and chiral domain behavior, with spatially resolved XML(C)D-PEEM supporting the conclusion that small antiferromagnetic domains, < 20 nm in size, of differing chirality account for the absence of observed Berry curvature driven magnetotransport effects."

We demonstrate a controlled tuning of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Bi-doped Y_3 Fe_5 O_12 (Bi:YIG) films of high crystalline quality using growth induced epitaxial strain on [111]-oriented Gd_3 Ga_5 O_12 (GGG) substrate. We optimize a growth protocol to get thick highly-strained epitaxial films showing large magneto-crystalline anisotropy, compare to thin films prepared using a different protocol. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements establish a linear dependence of the out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy on the strain induced rhombohedral distortion of Bi:YIG lattice. Interestingly, the enhancement in the magnetoelastic constant due to an optimum substitution of Bi^(3+) ions with strong spin orbit coupling does not strongly affect the precessional damping (~1.15x10^(-3) ). Large magneto-optical activity, reasonably low damping, large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and large magnetoelastic coupling in BiYIG are the properties that may help BiYIG emerge as a possible material for photo-magnonics and other spintronics applications."

We then investigate the notions of $\mathcal{U}$-frequent hypercyclicity and frequent hypercyclicity associated to these weighted densities. We show that there exists an operator which is $\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic for each weight in $\mathcal{A}$ but not frequently hypercyclic, although the set of frequently hypercyclic vectors always coincides with the intersection of sets of $\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic vectors for each weight in $\mathcal{A}$."

Using the modular bootstrap, universal bounds on (1+1)-dimensional bosonic conformal field theories with an internal $\mathbb{Z_2}$ global symmetry are derived. The bootstrap bounds depend dramatically on the 't Hooft anomaly. In particular, there is a universal upper bound on the lightest $\mathbb{Z_2}$ odd operator if the symmetry is anomalous, but there is no bound if the symmetry is non-anomalous. In the non-anomalous case, we find that the lightest $\mathbb{Z_2}$ odd state and the defect ground state cannot both be arbitrarily heavy. We also consider theories with a $U(1)$ global symmetry, and comment that there is no bound on the lightest $U(1)$ charged operator if the symmetry is non-anomalous."

However, it is still unclear whether the final mass and spin of the newly formed BH arises from the collapse of the entire stellar progenitor or just a fraction of it, given that coupling of accretion feedback released during BH formation to the surrounding infalling star will inevitably lead to its ejection. If the BH is built up via disk accretion, outflows from the center will result in residual gas ejection, thus halting the stellar collapse and reducing the amount of mass and spin that can be accreted by the newly formed BH. Here we discuss the general properties of BHs (mass and spin) associated with the collapse of rotating, helium star pre-supernova progenitors. When accretion feedback is included, the BH drives powerful outflows that heat the surrounding envelope, effectively shutting down the collapse. This gives rise to various outcomes ranging from very massive BHs with low spins, as inferred for GW150914, to lighter and faster-spinning BHs, as deduced for GW151226."

In particular, stars in the older populations encode information on the mechanisms that led to the formation of our Galaxy. In this article, we analyze the kinematics, spatial distribution, and chemistry of a large number of stars in the Solar Neighborhood, where all of the main Galactic components are well-represented. We find that the thick disk comprises two distinct and overlapping stellar populations, with different kinematic properties and chemical compositions. The metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) contains two times less metal content than the canonical thick disk, and exhibits enrichment of light elements typical of the oldest stellar populations of the Galaxy. The rotational velocity of the MWTD around the Galactic center is ~ 150 km s^(-1), corresponding to a rotational lag of 30 km s^(-1) relative to the canonical thick disk (~ 180 km s^(-1)), with a velocity dispersion of 60 km s^(-1). This stellar population likely originated from the merger of a dwarf galaxy during the early phases of our Galaxy's assembly, or it is a precursor disk, formed in the inner Galaxy and brought into the Solar Neighborhood by bar instability or spiral-arm formation mechanisms."

In the dynamical systems framework, it provides important information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. In this paper we provide a review of the meaning of the extremal index in dynamical systems. Depending on the observables used, this quantity can inform on local properties of attractors such as periodicity, stability and persistence in phase space, or on global properties such as the Lyapunov exponents. We also introduce a new estimator of the extremal index and shows its relation with those previously introduced in the statistical literature. We reserve a particular focus to the systems perturbed with noise as they are a good paradigm of many natural phenomena. Different kind of noises are investigated in the annealed and quenched situations. Applications to climate data are also presented."

The new representation is of the form $W=\operatorname{Sp}\left[ \rho \mathcal{W} \right]$, where $\rho$ is the density matrix, and $\mathcal{W}$ is the universal density matrix. The density matrix $\rho$ for each quantum system is different, and the universal matrix $\mathcal{W}$ is the same for any quantum system. Thus, the matrix $\mathcal{W}$ has a fundamental character. In the work, the elements of the universal matrix $\mathcal{W}$ were found explicitly and their properties were investigated. The diagonal elements of the matrix $\mathcal{W}$ are the Wigner functions of the harmonic oscillator, which do not introduce dissipation into the quantum system. The off-diagonal elements of the matrix $\mathcal{W}$ contain frequency oscillations responsible for dissipations in the quantum systems."

Assuming that the shallow decay segments of canonical X-ray afterglow lightcurves of {\em Swift} GRBs are attributed to the magnetic dipole (MD) radiations of newly-born magnetars, we derive the parameters of the magnetars and explore their possible relations to jet and MD wind emission. We show that the magnetar initial spin period ($P_0$) are tightly correlated with the jet energy ($E_{\rm jet}$), which is almost proportional to the wind energy ($E_{\rm wind}$). Our least square fits yield $P_0\propto E^{-0.36\pm 0.03}_{\rm jet}$ and $E_{\rm wind}\propto E^{0.91\pm 0.07}_{\rm jet}$. These relations may imply that a magnetar with faster rotating speed can power a more energetic GRB, and energy partition between the jet and wind may be quasi-universal. Although the $P_0-E_{\rm jet}$ relation is driven by a few sub-energetic GRBs in our sample, our Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that sample selection biases from instrumental flux limits and contaminations of the bright jet afterglows cannot make this correlation. Within this jet-wind paradigm, we propose that GRB 101225A-like ultra-long GRBs, whose prompt gamma-ray/X-ray lightcurves are featured as a long-lasting plateau with a sharp drop, may be the orphan MD wind emission being due to misalignment of their jet axis to the light of sight.

However, devices like cameras and drones may have limited computational capability and storage space so that the direct deployment of complex deep saliency models becomes infeasible. To address this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic saliency estimation approach for aerial videos via spatiotemporal knowledge distillation. In this approach, five components are involved, including two teachers, two students and the desired spatiotemporal model. The knowledge of spatial and temporal saliency is first separately transferred from the two complex and redundant teachers to their simple and compact students, and the input scenes are also degraded from high-resolution to low-resolution to remove the probable data redundancy so as to greatly speed up the feature extraction process. After that, the desired spatiotemporal model is further trained by distilling and encoding the spatial and temporal saliency knowledge of two students into a unified network. In this manner, the inter-model redundancy can be further removed for the effective estimation of dynamic saliency on aerial videos. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art models in estimating visual saliency on aerial videos, while its speed reaches up to 28,738 FPS on the GPU platform."

In order to assess its performances, we adopt ATLBO for the mixed strength t-way test generation problem. Experimental results reveal that ATLBO exhibits competitive performances against the original TLBO and other meta-heuristic counterparts."

Therefore, the experimental data can be quite messy due to the mixing of different modes, as well as the background noise, despite that each mode manifests itself as a single frequency oscillation. Here we develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract the frequencies of these oscillations from such measurement data, that is, the eigenenergies of these modes. This method is particularly useful when the measurement time is not long enough to perform the Fourier transformation. Our method is inspired by the independent component analysis method and its application to the cocktail party problem. In that problem, the goal is to recover each voice from detectors that detect signals of many mixed voices, and the principle is to find out signals that possess features and are away from a Gaussian distribution. Instead, our generalization is to find out signals that are close to a single frequency oscillation. We demonstrate the advantage of our method by an example of analyzing the collective mode of cold atoms. We believe this method can find broad applications in analyzing data from dynamical experiments in quantum systems."

The existence of two different conduction mechanisms (Nearest neighbor hopping and Motts variable range hopping) is observed using a combined study of conductivity, dielectric relaxation and impedance spectra in PZM. This investigation point towards a transition from nearest neighbor hoping to Motts variable range hopping mechanism due to lowering activation energy around 580 K. The charge carriers hopping between the localized acceptor states at the grain boundaries (GBs), which dominants conduction mechanism below 580 K. The ac conductivity, dielectric relaxation, Nyquist plot, and electric modulus highlight the blended effect of grains (Gs) and GBs leads to the charge carrier dynamics in PZM. The dielectric relaxation and modulus formalism are analyzed on the basis of empirical Cole-Cole model. The conduction mechanism is found to be highly correlated with the relaxation mechanism and impedance spectroscopy."

We train a multi-scale fully convolutional neural network simultaneously for two classes in order to segment real clinical 3D ultrasound data. Parallel pathways working at different levels of resolution account for high frequency speckle noise and global 3D image features. To ensure reproducibility, the publicly available RESECT dataset is utilized for training and cross-validation. Due to the absence of a ground truth, we train with weakly annotated label. We implement label transfer from MRI to US, which is prone to a residual but inevitable registration error. To further improve results, we perform transfer learning using synthetic US data. The resulting method leads to excellent Dice scores of 0.7080, 0.8402 and 0.9315 for grey matter, white matter and background. Our proposed methodology sets an unparalleled standard for white and grey matter segmentation in 3D intracranial ultrasound."

We consider a type-II WSM model with two Weyl nodes located on the $k_z$-axis, and the tilting of the Weyl cones are along the $k_x$ direction. Due to co-existing electron and hole pockets, the density of states at the Fermi energy becomes finite, leading to a significant enhancement of Kondo effect. Consequently, the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons always form a bound state, this behavior is distinct from that in the type-I WSMs, where the bound state is only formed when the hybridization exceeds a critical value. Meanwhile, the spin-orbit coupling and unique geometry of the Fermi surface lead to strongly anisotropic Kondo screening cloud in coordinate space. The tilting terms break the rotational symmetry of the type-II WSM about the $k_z$-axis, but the system remains invariant under a combined transformation $\mathcal{T}R^{y}(\pi)$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the time-reversal operation and $R^{y}(\pi)$ is the rotation about the $y$-axis by $\pi$. Largely modified diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin-spin correlation function on three principal planes reflect this change in band symmetry. Most saliently, the tilting terms trigger the emergence of non-zero off-diagonal components of spin-spin correlation function on the $x$-$z$ principal plane."

By transferring this phenomenon to optics, we show how the branched flow of light can be controlled to propagate along a single branch rather than through many of them at the same time. Our method is based on shaping the incoming wavefront and only requires partial knowledge of the system's transmission matrix. We show that the light flowing along a single branch has a broadband frequency stability such that we can even steer pulses along selected branches - a prospect with many interesting possibilities for wave control in disordered environments."

Reducing Bias in Bios without Access to Protected   Attributes,"There is a growing body of work that proposes methods for mitigating bias in machine learning systems. These methods typically rely on access to protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. However, this raises two significant challenges: (1) protected attributes may not be available or it may not be legal to use them, and (2) it is often desirable to simultaneously consider multiple protected attributes, as well as their intersections. In the context of mitigating bias in occupation classification, we propose a method for discouraging correlation between the predicted probability of an individual's true occupation and a word embedding of their name. This method leverages the societal biases that are encoded in word embeddings, eliminating the need for access to protected attributes. Crucially, it only requires access to individuals' names at training time and not at deployment time. We evaluate two variations of our proposed method using a large-scale dataset of online biographies. We find that both variations simultaneously reduce race and gender biases, with almost no reduction in the classifier's overall true positive rate."

Compared to the standard likelihood-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, DELFI has several advantages: it is highly parallelizable, there is no need to assume a possibly incorrect functional form for the likelihood and complicated effects (e.g the mask and detector systematics) are easier to handle with forward models. In light of this, we present two DELFI pipelines to perform weak lensing parameter inference with lognormal realizations of the tomographic shear field -- using the C_l summary statistic. The first pipeline accounts for the non-Gaussianities of the shear field, intrinsic alignments and photometric-redshift error. We validate that it is accurate enough for Stage III experiments and estimate that O(1000) simulations are needed to perform inference on Stage IV data. By comparing the second DELFI pipeline, which makes no assumption about the functional form of the likelihood, with the standard MCMC approach, which assumes a Gaussian likelihood, we test the impact of the Gaussian likelihood approximation in the MCMC analysis. We find it has a negligible impact on Stage IV parameter constraints. Our pipeline is a step towards seamlessly propagating all data-processing, instrumental, theoretical and astrophysical systematics through to the final parameter constraints."

UCN produced via downscattering in solid deuterium were polarized via transport through a 7 T magnetic field, and then directed to a 1 T solenoidal electron spectrometer, where the decay electrons were detected in electron detector packages located on the two ends of the spectrometer. A value for $A_0$ was then extracted from the asymmetry in the numbers of counts in the two detector packages. We summarize all of the results from the UCNA experiment, obtained during run periods in 2007, 2008--2009, 2010, and 2011--2013, which ultimately culminated in a 0.67\% precision result for $A_0$."

Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to improve network utilization and hence performance, by moving frequently interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same server or datacenter. However, dynamically changing the embedding of workloads is algorithmically challenging: communication patterns are often not known ahead of time, but must be learned. During the learning process, overheads related to unnecessary moves (i.e., re-embeddings) should be minimized. This paper studies a fundamental model which captures the tradeoff between the benefits and costs of dynamically collocating communication partners on $\ell$ servers, in an online manner. Our main contribution is a distributed online algorithm which is asymptotically almost optimal, i.e., almost matches the lower bound (also derived in this paper) on the competitive ratio of any (distributed or centralized) online algorithm. As an application, we show that our algorithm can be used to solve a distributed union find problem in which the sets are stored across multiple servers."

Our framework employs a trainable synthesizer network that is optimized to produce meaningful training samples by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a `target' network. The synthesizer and target networks are trained in an adversarial manner wherein each network is updated with a goal to outdo the other. Additionally, we ensure the synthesizer generates realistic data by pairing it with a discriminator trained on real-world images. Further, to make the target classifier invariant to blending artefacts, we introduce these artefacts to background regions of the training images so the target does not over-fit to them.   We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to different target networks including a classification network on AffNIST, and two object detection networks (SSD, Faster-RCNN) on different datasets. On the AffNIST benchmark, our approach is able to surpass the baseline results with just half the training examples. On the VOC person detection benchmark, we show improvements of up to 2.7% as a result of our data augmentation. Similarly on the GMU detection benchmark, we report a performance boost of 3.5% in mAP over the baseline method, outperforming the previous state of the art approaches by up to 7.5% on specific categories."

The methodology is based on dynamically scheduling setting values for air conditioning and lighting to minimize drowsiness level of office workers on the basis of a prediction model that represents the relation between future drowsiness level and combination of indoor temperature and ambient illuminance. The prediction model can be identified by utilizing state-of-the-art drowsiness estimation method. The proposed methodology was evaluated in regard to a real routine task (performed by six subjects over five workdays), and the evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology improved the processing speed of the task by 8.3% without degrading comfort of the workers."

The central question is: How many bits are necessary to store $Q_p$?   This problem has applications to the communication of approximating the number of non-zeros in a matrix product, the size of coresets in projective clustering, the memory of streaming algorithms for regression in the row-update model, and embedding subspaces of $L_p$ in functional analysis. A major open question is the dependence on the approximation factor $\epsilon$.   We show if $p\geq 0$ is not a positive even integer and $d=\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$, then $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2}d)$ bits are necessary. On the other hand, if $p$ is a positive even integer, then there is an upper bound of $O(d^p\log(nd))$ bits independent of $\epsilon$. Our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and show in particular that one cannot compress $A$ to $O(d)$ ""directions"" $v_1,\dots,v_{O(d)}$, such that for any $x$, $\|Ax\|_1$ can be well-approximated from $\langle v_1,x\rangle,\dots,\langle v_{O(d)},x\rangle$. Our lower bound rules out arbitrary functions of these inner products (and in fact arbitrary data structures built from $A$), and thus rules out the possibility of a singular value decomposition for $\ell_1$ in a very strong sense. Indeed, as $\epsilon\to 0$, for $p = 1$ the space complexity becomes arbitrarily large, while for $p = 2$ it is at most $O(d^2 \log(nd))$. As corollaries of our main lower bound, we obtain new lower bounds for a wide range of applications, including the above, which in many cases are optimal."

With its growing set of use cases encompassing communication, navigation, media consumption, entertainment, finance, health, and access to sensors, actuators, cameras, or microphones, its underlying security model needs to address a host of practical threats in a wide variety of scenarios while being useful to non-security experts. The model needs to strike a difficult balance between security, privacy, and usability for end users, assurances for app developers, and system performance under tight hardware constraints. While many of the underlying design principles have implicitly informed the overall system architecture, access control mechanisms, and mitigation techniques, the Android security model has previously not been formally published. This paper aims to both document the abstract model and discuss its implications. Based on a definition of the threat model and Android ecosystem context in which it operates, we analyze how the different security measures in past and current Android implementations work together to mitigate these threats. There are some special cases in applying the security model, and we discuss such deliberate deviations from the abstract model."

We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.

The windsea spectrum is kept equal for all cases, while the swell is altered. Analysis of the combined wave system gives the impression that the mixed sea has milder extreme wave statistics than the windsea alone, especially when the nonlinearities in the two systems clearly differ. Upon partitioning the mixed sea into windsea and swell, the windsea part is found to be nearly unaffected by the swell and to be governed by essentially the same statistics irrespective of a swell being present or not. This result is found for skewness, kurtosis and exceedance probability of envelope and crest height."

While the method relies on a fairly sophisticated deformable part model, unlike existing techniques it estimates the model parameters in an unsupervised fashion thus alleviating the need for a user-annotated training data and avoiding the associated specificity. This automatic fitting process is carried out by exploiting the recurrence of small image patches associated with the repeating object and analyzing their spatial correlation. The analysis allows us to reject outlier patches, recover the visual and shape parameters of the part model, and detect the object instances efficiently. In order to achieve a practical system which is able to cope with diverse images, we describe a simple and intuitive active-learning procedure that updates the object classification by querying the user on very few carefully chosen marginal classifications. Evaluation of the new method against the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates its ability to achieve higher accuracy through a better user experience."

It is shown that the electron beam propagates in a plasma as a beam-plasma structure and is a source of Langmuir waves. The plasma inhomogeneity changes the spatial distribution of the waves. The spatial distribution of the waves is fully determined by the distribution of plasma inhomogeneities.

We propose a novel scheme for the transfer of two-electron entangled states, from one edge of a quantum dot array to the other by coherent adiabatic passage. This protocol is mediated by pulsed tunneling barriers. In a second step, we seek for a speed up by shortcut to adiabaticity techniques. This significantly reduces the operation time and, thus, minimizes the impact of decoherence. For typical parameters of state-of-the-art solid state devices, the accelerated protocol has an operation time in the nanosecond range and terminates before a major coherence loss sets in. The scheme represents a promising candidate for entanglement transfer in solid state quantum information processing."

Existing domain adaptation theories naturally imply minimax optimization algorithms, which connect well with the domain adaptation methods based on adversarial learning. However, several disconnections still exist and form the gap between theory and algorithm. We extend previous theories (Mansour et al., 2009c; Ben-David et al., 2010) to multiclass classification in domain adaptation, where classifiers based on the scoring functions and margin loss are standard choices in algorithm design. We introduce Margin Disparity Discrepancy, a novel measurement with rigorous generalization bounds, tailored to the distribution comparison with the asymmetric margin loss, and to the minimax optimization for easier training. Our theory can be seamlessly transformed into an adversarial learning algorithm for domain adaptation, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves the state of the art accuracies on challenging domain adaptation tasks."

Yet, parallel AMG lacks scalability due to increasingly large costs associated with communication, both in the initial construction of a multigrid hierarchy as well as the iterative solve phase. This work introduces a parallel implementation of AMG to reduce the cost of communication, yielding an increase in scalability. Standard inter-process communication consists of sending data regardless of the send and receive process locations. Performance tests show notable differences in the cost of intra- and inter-node communication, motivating a restructuring of communication. In this case, the communication schedule takes advantage of the less costly intra-node communication, reducing both the number and size of inter-node messages. Node-centric communication extends to the range of components in both the setup and solve phase of AMG, yielding an increase in the weak and strong scalability of the entire method."

The motor consists of a cytoplasmic 'rotor' ring and a number of 'stator' units, which are bound to the cell wall of the bacterium. Recently, it has been shown that the number of functional torque-generating stator units in the motor depends on the external load, and suggested that mechanosensing in the flagellar motor is driven via a 'catch bond' mechanism in the motor's stator units. We present a method that allows us to measure -- on a single motor -- stator unit dynamics across a large range of external loads, including near the zero-torque limit. By attaching superparamagnetic beads to the flagellar hook, we can control the motor's speed via a rotating magnetic field. We manipulate the motor to four different speed levels in two different ion-motive force (IMF) conditions. This framework allows for a deeper exploration into the mechanism behind load-dependent remodelling by separating out motor properties, such as rotation speed and energy availability in the form of IMF, that affect the motor torque."

We analyse several observations of RXTE/PCA archival data of the black hole binary GX 339-4 which show QPOs. In the type C QPOs, we confirm the presence of the 'hypotenuse' pattern where there is nonlinear coupling between low frequencies that sum to the QPO frequency as well as the 'web' pattern where in addition to the hypotenuse, nonlinear coupling between the QPO frequency and the broadband noise is present. We find that type B QPOs show a previously unknown pattern. We also show that the bicoherence pattern changes gradually from 'web' to 'hypotenuse' as the source moves from a hard intermediate state to a soft intermediate state. Additionally, we reconstruct the QPO waveforms from six observations using the biphase. Finally, we present a scenario by which a moderate increase in the optical depth of the hard X-ray emission region can explain the changes in the non-linearity seen during this transition."

The resulting approximate second fundamental forms are defined not only for piecewise-smooth surfaces, but also for datasets of very general type (like, e.g., point clouds).

This paper reports scintillation performance of calcium iodide (CaI2) crystal. Large light emission of 2.7 times that of NaI(Tl) and an emission wavelength in good agreement with the sensitive wavelength of the photomultiplier were obtained. A study of pulse shape discrimination using alpha and gamma sources was also performed. We confirmed that CaI2 has excellent pulse shape discrimination potential with a quick analysis.

We model optical propagation in such a dissipative system through a generalized cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation accounting for the amplification of the active medium and the effect of absorption and thermo-modulational nonlinearity of gold. We find that heating heavily affects the propagation of temporal dissipative solitons in such a plasmonic waveguide by producing a soliton self-frequency redshift accompanied by soliton deceleration in the time domain. By adopting a semi-analytical variational approach, we evaluate the dependence of the self-induced redshift by deriving a set of coupled differential equations for the pulse parameters. These equations provide physical insight into the complex nonlinear dynamics through simple approximate analytic expressions for temporal and frequency shifts. Such analytical predictions are found in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the generalized cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results provide a general understanding of ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in gold-based active plasmonic waveguides, as in particular the spectral shaping properties of propagating optical pulses."

This paper investigates the robustness of deep learning-based super-resolution methods against adversarial attacks, which can significantly deteriorate the super-resolved images without noticeable distortion in the attacked low-resolution images. It is demonstrated that state-of-the-art deep super-resolution methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Different levels of robustness of different methods are analyzed theoretically and experimentally.

NEOCam is a NASA Planetary mission whose goal is to discover and characterize asteroids and comets, to assess the hazard to Earth from near-Earth objects, and to study the origin, evolution, and fate of asteroids and comets. NEOCam will, however, cover 68% of the extragalactic sky and as the NEOWISE-R mission has recently proved, infrared information is now vital for identifying and characterizing the $\gtrsim$10 million IR bright Active Galactic Nuclei, as well as using the IR light curve to provide deep insights into accretion disk astrophysics. NEOWISE-R data has also been used to discover Super-luminous Supernovae, dust echos in Tidal Disruption Events and detects all of the known $z\geq7$ quasars (and over 80% of the known $z\geq6.70$ quasars).

A profound consequence of using these degrees of freedom is the emergence of an overarching periodicity in the local atomic registry of the constituent crystal structures, known as a moir\'e superlattice. Its presence in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) structures led to the observation of electronic minibands, whereas its effect enhanced by interlayer resonant conditions in twisted graphene bilayers culminated in the observation of the superconductor-insulator transition at magic twist angles. Here, we demonstrate that, in semiconducting heterostructures built of incommensurate MoSe2 and WS2 monolayers, excitonic bands can hybridise, resulting in the resonant enhancement of the moir\'e superlattice effects. MoSe2 and WS2 are specifically chosen for the near degeneracy of their conduction band edges to promote the hybridisation of intra- and interlayer excitons, which manifests itself through a pronounced exciton energy shift as a periodic function of the interlayer rotation angle. This occurs as hybridised excitons (hX) are formed by holes residing in MoSe2 bound to a twist-dependent superposition of electron states in the adjacent monolayers. For heterostructures with almost aligned pairs of monolayer crystals, resonant mixing of the electron states leads to pronounced effects of the heterostructure's geometrical moir\'e pattern on the hX dispersion and optical spectrum. Our findings underpin novel strategies for band-structure engineering in semiconductor devices based on van der Waals heterostructures."

Here, we propose a synthesis of the independent scientific frameworks of economic complexity and urban scaling into a consistent mechanism - termed 'city complexity' - to measure the fitness of cities across multiple dimensions. Essentially, we propose the use of urban scaling as the basis to construct and populate a bipartite city-outcome matrix, whose entries are the deviations from scaling law for a given set of urban outcomes. This matrix forms the input into the economic complexity methodology, which iterates over a pair of coupled non-linear maps, computing fitness of cities and complexity of outcomes. We test our algorithm with data from American cities and find that the emergent city fitness measure is consistent with desired behavior across the set of outcomes studied. We also find temporal evolution of city fitness and outcome complexity to be in agreement with theoretical expectation. Overall, these findings suggest that the city complexity mechanism proposed here produces a robust measure of fitness and can be applied for any set of diverse outcomes, irrespective of the specifics of national urban contexts."

Analytical estimates from the linearized variational equations together with numerical integrations predict the bulk Lyapunov exponent value as $\lambda\approx 2\pi Tn$, where $n$ is the winding number of the string. The celebrated bound on chaos stating that $\lambda\leq 2\pi T$ is thus systematically modified for winding strings in the bulk. Within gauge/string duality, such strings apparently correspond to complicated operators which either do not move on Regge trajectories, or move on subleading trajectories with an unusual slope. Depending on the energy scale, the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of these operators may still obey the bound $2\pi T$, or they may violate it like the bulk exponent. We do not know exactly why the bound on chaos can be modified but the indication from the gauge/string dual viewpoint is that the correlation functions of the dual gauge operators never factorize and thus the original derivation of the bound on chaos does not apply."

We give two alternative description of this algebraic connected sum: the first uses algebraic analogues of Thom classes of vector bundles and Gysin homomorphisms, the second is in terms of Macaulay dual generators. We also investigate the extent to which the connected sum construction preserves the weak or strong Lefschetz property, thus providing new classes of rings which satisfy these properties."

Because of the transitions, the power spectrum deviates from the vacuum one and there will appear oscillatory behavior. In the case of a scalar-type curvature perturbation, it is known that the amplitude of these oscillations may be enhanced to result in the power spectrum larger than the one for the vacuum case. One might expect the similar enhancement for the tensor perturbation as well. Unfortunately, it is found that when the equation of state (EOS) parameter $w=p/\rho$ of the break stage is a constant with $w>-1/3$, the amplitude of oscillations is never large enough to enhance the power spectrum. On the contrary, the power spectrum is found to be suppressed even on those scales that leave the horizon at the first inflationary stage and remain superhorizon throughout the entire stage. We identify the cause of this suppression with the correction terms in additional to the leading order constant solution on superhorizon scales. We argue that our result is general in the sense that any intermediate break stage during inflation cannot yield an enhancement of the tensor spectrum as long as the Hubble expansion rate is non-increasing in time."

We apply linear spin-wave theory to obtain the magnon dispersion and its degenerated points. These special degenerated points emerge on the excitation spectrum as a function of the external fields and can be identified as Bosonic Dirac Points (BDP). Since that, in the vicinity of these points the Magnons becomes massless with a linear energy spectrum as well as insensible in relation to weak impurity, exactly as it occurs with a Fermionic Dirac point. We also have calculated the quantum and thermal fluctuations over the ground state of the system using Effective Field Theory. Our results point out that this simple model can host Bosonic Dirac points and therefore is a suitable prototype to build a Bosonic Dirac material only controlled by external field."

Here, we present a framework to compute reliable errors in prediction for Neural Networks using Test-Time Dropout and Conformal Prediction. Specifically, the algorithm consists of training a single Neural Network using dropout, and then applying it N times to both the validation and test sets, also employing dropout in this step. Therefore, for each instance in the validation and test sets an ensemble of predictions were generated. The residuals and absolute errors in prediction for the validation set were then used to compute prediction errors for test set instances using Conformal Prediction. We show using 24 bioactivity data sets from ChEMBL 23 that dropout Conformal Predictors are valid (i.e., the fraction of instances whose true value lies within the predicted interval strongly correlates with the confidence level) and efficient, as the predicted confidence intervals span a narrower set of values than those computed with Conformal Predictors generated using Random Forest (RF) models. Lastly, we show in retrospective virtual screening experiments that dropout and RF-based Conformal Predictors lead to comparable retrieval rates of active compounds. Overall, we propose a computationally efficient framework (as only N extra forward passes are required in addition to training a single network) to harness Test-Time Dropout and the Conformal Prediction framework, and to thereby generate reliable prediction errors for deep Neural Networks."

Using the gamma-ray luminosity functions for blazars including flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects, as well as the $Fermi$-LAT detection efficiency, we estimate contributions from {blazars resolved by $Fermi$-LAT as well as the unresolved counterpart.} Combining the existing upper limits from stacking analyses, the cumulative neutrino flux from all blazars ({including $Fermi$-LAT resolved and unresolved ones}) are constrained { in the range $0\lesssim\gamma_{\rm lw}\lesssim2.5$}. We also evaluate the effects of the redshift evolution and the effective local number densities for each class of FSRQs, BL Lacs, and all blazars, by which we place another type of constraints on the blazar contribution using the non-detection of high-energy neutrino multiplets. We demonstrate that these two upper limits are complementary, and that the joint consideration of the stacking and multiplet analyses { not only supports the argument that blazars are disfavored as the dominant sources of the 100-TeV neutrino background, but it extends this argument by including also $Fermi$-LAT-unresolved blazars as well, for a more generic luminosity correlation $L_{\nu}\propto (L_{\rm ph})^{\gamma_{\rm lw}}$}."

We obtained high-cadence, high-signal-to-noise photometry of the UT 2018 April 9 inferior shadowing event in the Jupiter Trojan binary system Patroclus-Menoetius in four Sloan bands $-$ $g'$, $r'$, $i'$, and $z'$. We use an eclipse lightcurve model to fit for a precise mid-eclipse time and estimate the minimum separation of the two eclipsing components during the event. Our best-fit mid-eclipse time of $2458217.80943^{+0.00057}_{-0.00050}$ is 19 minutes later than the prediction of Grundy et al. (2018); the minimum separation between the center of Menoetius' shadow and the center of Patroclus is $72.5\pm0.7$ km $-$ slightly larger than the predicted 69.5 km. Using the derived lightcurves, we find no evidence for significant albedo variations or large-scale topographic features on the Earth-facing hemisphere and limb of Patroclus. We also apply the technique of eclipse mapping to place an upper bound of $\sim$0.15 mag on wide-scale surface color variability across Patroclus."

Let $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$ denote the set of analytic bounded point evaluations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure of $R^t(K, \mu)$. In the work of Thomson on describing the closure in $L^t(\mu)$ of analytic polynomials, $P^t(\mu)$, the existence of analytic bounded point evaluations plays critical roles, while $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$ may be empty. We introduce the concept of non-removable boundary $\mathcal F$ such that the removable set $\mathcal R = K\setminus \mathcal F$ contains $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$. Recent remarkable developments in analytic capacity and Cauchy transform provide us the necessary tools to describe $\mathcal F$ and obtain structural results for $R^t(K, \mu)$.   Assume that $R^t(K, \mu)$ does not have a direct $L^t$ summand. Let $H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ be the weak$^*$ closure in $L^\infty (\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ of the functions that are bounded analytic off compact subsets of $\mathcal F$, where $\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R}$ denotes the planar Lebesgue measure restricted to $\mathcal R$. We prove that the identity map ($r\rightarrow r$, $r$ is a rational function with poles off $K$) extends an isometric isomorphism and a weak$^*$ homeomorphism from $R^t(K, \mu)\cap L^\infty(\mu )$ onto $H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R })$.   Consequently, we show that a decomposition theorem (Main Theorem II) of $R^t(K, \mu)$ holds for an arbitrary compact subset $K$ and finite positive measure $\mu$ supported on $K$, which extends the central results regarding $P^t(\mu)$."

At higher Fermi energies i.e. carrier densities, the electrical transport is diffusive in nature and the propagation occurs via plane-waves. In this study, we report the detection of such evanescent modes in the surface states of topological insulator through 1/f noise. While signatures of pseudo-diffusive transport have been seen experimentally in graphene, such behavior is yet to be observed explicitly in any other system with a Dirac dispersion. To probe this, we have studied 1/f noise in topological insulators as a function of gate-voltage, and temperature. Our results show a non-monotonic behavior in 1=f noise as the Fermi energy is varied, suggesting a crossover from pseudo-diffusive to diffusive transport regime in mesoscopic topological insulators. The temperature dependence of noise points towards conductance fluctuations from quantum interference as the dominant source of the noise in these samples."

This is motivated by the fact that the pure online model is often too restrictive to model real-world applications, where some changes might be allowed. A well-studied measure of the amount of decisions that can be revoked is the migration factor $\beta$: When an object $o$ of size $s(o)$ arrives, the decisions for objects of total size at most $\beta\cdot s(o)$ may be revoked. Usually $\beta$ should be a constant. This means that a small object only leads to small changes. This measure has been successfully investigated for different, classic problems such as bin packing or makespan minimization. The dual of makespan minimization - the Santa Claus or machine covering problem - has also been studied, whereas the dual of bin packing - the bin covering problem - has not been looked at from such a perspective.   In this work, we extensively study the bin covering problem with migration in different scenarios. We develop algorithms both for the static case - where only insertions are allowed - and for the dynamic case, where items may also depart. We also develop lower bounds for these scenarios both for amortized migration and for worst-case migration showing that our algorithms have nearly optimal migration factor and asymptotic competitive ratio (up to an arbitrary small $\eps$). We therefore resolve the competitiveness of the bin covering problem with migration."

Special attention is paid to the so-called dynamical method for locating the transition point, which, apart from the stability of the uniform nuclear matter against clusterization, also considers contributions due to finite-size effects. In particular, contributions to the transition density and pressure from the direct and exchange energies are carefully analyzed. To this end, finite-range forces of Gogny, Modified Gogny Interaction (MDI) and Simple Effective Interaction (SEI) types are used in the numerical applications. The results from the dynamical approach are compared with those from the popular thermodynamical method that neglects the surface and Coulomb effects in the stability condition. The dependence of the core-crust transition on the stiffness of the symmetry energy of the finite-range models is also addressed. Finally, we analyze the impact of the transition point on the mass, thickness and fraction of the moment of inertia of the neutron star crust. Prominent differences in these crustal properties of the star are found between using the transition point obtained with the dynamical method or the thermodynamical method. It is concluded that the core-crust transition needs to be ascertained as precisely as possible in order to have realistic estimates of the observed phenomena where the crust plays a significant role."

In this paper, we propose a hybrid dynamics model, simulator-augmented interaction networks (SAIN), combining a physics engine with an object-based neural network for dynamics modeling. Compared with existing models that are purely analytical or purely data-driven, our hybrid model captures the dynamics of interacting objects in a more accurate and data-efficient manner.Experiments both in simulation and on a real robot suggest that it also leads to better performance when used in complex control tasks.

Encouraged by the results on LaH10, in consideration of the differences between La and Pr, Pr-H system is especially worth studying because of the magnetism and valence-band f-electrons in element Pr. Here we successfully synthesized praseodymium superhydrides (PrH9) in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated the presence of previously predicted F43m-PrH9 and unexpected P63/mmc-PrH9 phases. Moreover, Fm3m-PrH3, P4/nmm-PrH(3-{\delta}) and Fm3m-PrH(1+x) were found below 52 GPa. F43m-PrH9 and P63/mmc-PrH9 were stable above 100 GPa in experiment. Experimental studies of electrical resistance in the PrH9 sample showed the emergence of superconducting transition (Tc) below 9K and a dependent Tc on applied magnetic field. Theoretical calculations indicate that magnetic order and electron-phonon interaction coexist in a very close range of pressures in the PrH9 sample which may contribute to its low superconducting temperature Tc. Our results highlight the intimate connections among hydrogenic sublattices, density of states, magnetism and superconductivity in Pr-based superhydrides."

The two light beams are copies of each other. Its computational version removes the requirement of a spatially resolved detector when the light intensity pattern is pre-known. Here, we exploit the temporal analogue of computational ghost imaging, and demonstrate a computational distributed fiber-optic sensing technique. Temporal images containing spatially distributed scattering information used for sensing purposes are retrieved through correlating the ""integrated"" backscattered light and the pre-known binary patterns. The sampling rate required for our technique is inversely proportional to the total time duration of a binary sequence, so that it can be significantly reduced compared to that of the traditional methods. Our experiments demonstrate a 3 orders of magnitude reduction in the sampling rate, offering great simplification and cost reduction in the distributed fiber-optic sensors."

The FeCr2Se4 undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below 222 K. Substitution of tellurium lowers the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature and leads to short range ferromagnetic cluster behavior towards the tellurium end. Change over from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic like behavior is also reflected in the corresponding transformation from semiconducting to metallic transport behavior. There is a large variation in the Curie-Weiss temperature, effective magnetic moment and ordering temperature (TN / TC) with Te substitution. The electronic band structure calculations suggest antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic ground state for the FeCr2Se4 and FeCr2Te4 respectively."

General theory,The consistent recursive subtraction of UV divergences order by order in the loop expansion for spontaneously broken effective field theories with dimension-6 derivative operators is presented for an Abelian gauge group. We solve the Slavnov-Taylor identity to all orders in the loop expansion by homotopy techniques and a suitable choice of invariant field coordinates (named bleached variables) for the linearly realized gauge group. This allows one to disentangle the gauge-invariant contributions to off-shell 1-PI amplitudes from those associated with the gauge-fixing and (generalized) non-polynomial field redefinitions (that do appear already at one loop). The tools presented can be easily generalized to the non-Abelian case.

However, as robots and humans come closer in their interactions, the matter of interpretability, or explainability of robot decision-making processes for the human grows in importance. A successful interaction and collaboration will only take place through mutual understanding of underlying representations of the environment and the task at hand. This is currently a challenge in deep learning systems. We present a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning system, consisting of a low-level agent handling the large actions/states space of a robotic system efficiently, by following the directives of a high-level agent which is learning the high-level dynamics of the environment and task. This high-level agent forms a representation of the world and task at hand that is interpretable for a human operator. The method, which we call Dot-to-Dot, is tested on a MuJoCo-based model of the Fetch Robotics Manipulator, as well as a Shadow Hand, to test its performance. Results show efficient learning of complex actions/states spaces by the low-level agent, and an interpretable representation of the task and decision-making process learned by the high-level agent."

Here we use transport and inelastic neutron scattering to study spin excitations and in-plane resistivity anisotropy in uniaxial pressure detwinned BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and SrFe$_2$As$_2$, the parent compounds of iron pnictide superconductors. While BaFe$_2$As$_2$ exhibits weakly first order tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural and antiferromagnetic (AF) phase transitions below $T_s > T_N\approx 138$ K, SrFe$_2$As$_2$ has strongly coupled first order structural and AF transitions below $T_s= T_N\approx 210$ K. We find that the direct signatures of the nematic phase persist to lower temperatures above the phase transition in the case of SrFe$_2$As$_2$ compared to BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Our findings support the conclusion that the strongly first-order nature of the magnetic transition in SrFe$_2$As$_2$ weakens the nematic phase and resistivity anisotropy in the system."

In this article, in the absence of the axiom of choice, connections between Loeb and sequential spaces are investigated. Among other results, it is proved in $\mathbf{ZF}$ that if $\mathbf{X}$ is a Cantor completely metrizable second-countable space, then $\mathbf{X}^{\omega}$ is Loeb. If a sequential, sequentially locally compact space $\mathbf{X}$ has the property that every infinitely countable family of non-empty closed subsets of $\mathbf{X}$ has a choice function, then the Cartesian product $\mathbf{X}\times\mathbf{Y}$ of $\mathbf{X}$ with any sequential space $\mathbf{Y}$ is sequential. In consequence, it holds true in $\mathbf{ZF}$ that the Cartesian product of a sequential locally countably compact space with any sequential space is sequential. If $\mathbb{R}$ is sequential, then every second-countable compact Hausdorff space is sequential. It is also proved that, in some models of $\mathbf{ZF}$, a countable product of Cantor completely metrizable second-countable spaces can fail to be Loeb and it is independent of $\mathbf{ZF}$ that every sequential subspace of $% \mathbb{R}$ is Loeb. Some other sentences are shown to be independent of $% \mathbf{ZF}$. Several open problems are posed, among them, the following question: is $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ sequential if $\mathbb{R}$ is sequential?"

Using the standard fundamental solutions of the Laplace operator and the heat operator, we reduce the Navier-Stokes equations to a nonlinear Fredholm equation of the form $(I+K) u = f$, where $K$ is a compact continuous operator in anisotropic normed H\""older spaces weighted at the point at infinity with respect to the space variables. Actually, the weight function is included to provide a finite energy estimate for solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for all $t \in [0,T]$. On using the particular properties of the de Rham complex we conclude that the Fr\'echet derivative $(I+K)'$ is continuously invertible at each point of the Banach space under consideration and the map $I+K$ is open and injective in the space. In this way the Navier-Stokes equations prove to induce an open one-to-one mapping in the scale of H\""older spaces."

Since hand-object contact is fundamental to grasping, capturing it can lead to important insights. However, observing contact through external sensors is challenging because of occlusion and the complexity of the human hand. We present ContactDB, a novel dataset of contact maps for household objects that captures the rich hand-object contact that occurs during grasping, enabled by use of a thermal camera. Participants in our study grasped 3D printed objects with a post-grasp functional intent. ContactDB includes 3750 3D meshes of 50 household objects textured with contact maps and 375K frames of synchronized RGB-D+thermal images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset that records detailed contact maps for human grasps. Analysis of this data shows the influence of functional intent and object size on grasping, the tendency to touch/avoid 'active areas', and the high frequency of palm and proximal finger contact. Finally, we train state-of-the-art image translation and 3D convolution algorithms to predict diverse contact patterns from object shape.

During a campaign monitoring the star for possible exoplanet transits, we identified an increase in Sloan i' flux leading to an observed peak at BJD 2457935.996 that was at least 10\% over pre-flare flux in this band. It was followed by a 2-component rapid decline in the first 100 seconds that became a slower exponential decay with time constant of 1350 seconds. A smaller flare event 1300 seconds after the first added an incremental peak flux increase of 1% of pre-flare flux. Since the onset of the flare was not fully time-resolved at a cadence of 62 seconds, its actual peak value is unknown but greater than the time-average over a single exposure of 20 seconds. The i' band is representative of broad optical and near-IR continuum flux over which the integrated energy of the flare is 100 times the stellar luminosity. This meets the criteria that established the concept of superflares on similar stars. The resulting implied ultraviolet flux and space weather could have had an extreme effect on the atmospheres of planets within the star's otherwise-habitable zone."

The growing interest in graph-structured data increases the importance of gaining human insight into such datasets by means of visualization. Among the most popular visualization techniques, classical t-SNE is not suitable on such datasets because it has no mechanism to make use of information from the graph structure. On the other hand, visualization techniques which operate on graphs, such as Laplacian Eigenmaps and tsNET, have no mechanism to make use of information from node features. Our proposed method GraphTSNE produces visualizations which account for both graph structure and node features. It is based on scalable and unsupervised training of a graph convolutional network on a modified t-SNE loss. By assembling a suite of evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our method produces desirable visualizations on three benchmark datasets."

Measurements of observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state of the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the conditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. A formula is given for the post-selected system state, conditioned on measurement outcomes, which is closely related to the notion of an instrument as introduced by Davies and Lewis. This formula has the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites, provided that their coupling regions can be causally ordered and a certain causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics; the composite is independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists. The general framework is amenable to calculation, as is shown in a specific example. This contribution reports on joint work with R. Verch, arXiv:1810.06512."

We use data obtained from the GAIA DR2 release. By using an inversion of GAIA parallax measurements to obtain distance values and by defining limits to the proper motions of the Taurus moving group, we are able to show that there are substantial differences in depth within the Taurus complex. Our results suggest that the Taurus cloud has significant depth and that there are two main associations centred at ~130.6+/-0.7 pc and ~160.2+/-0.9 pc at 1{\sigma}. These two associations also have different proper motions, of 24.5+/-2.8 and 20.1+/-2.4 mas/yr respectively. We here label them the 'Two Horns' of Taurus."

For our purposes, we captured 4D sequences of people uttering 500 words, contained in the Lip Reading Words (LRW) a publicly available large-scale in-the-wild dataset, and built a set of 3D blendshapes appropriate for speech. We correlate the 3D shape parameters of the speech blendshapes to the LRW audio samples by means of a novel time-warping technique, named Deep Canonical Attentional Warping (DCAW), that can simultaneously learn hierarchical non-linear representations and a warping path in an end-to-end manner.

Yet, neural networks can only process continuous input data. This is particularly challenging for security-related non-continuous data like system calls. This work focuses on four different options to preprocess sequences of system calls so that they can be processed by neural networks. These input options are based on one-hot encoding and learning word2vec or GloVe representations of system calls. As an additional option, we analyze if the mapping of system calls to their respective kernel modules is an adequate generalization step for (a) replacing system calls or (b) enhancing system call data with additional information regarding their context. However, when performing such preprocessing steps it is important to ensure that no relevant information is lost during the process. The overall objective of system call based intrusion detection is to categorize sequences of system calls as benign or malicious behavior. Therefore, this scenario is used to evaluate the different input options as a classification task. The results show, that each of the four different methods is a valid option when preprocessing input data, but the use of kernel modules only is not recommended because too much information is being lost during the mapping process."

A handful of insect visual neurons have been computationally modeled and successfully applied for robotics. How different neurons collaborate on motion perception, is an open question to date. In this paper, we propose a novel embedded vision system in autonomous micro-robots, to recognize motion patterns in dynamic robot scenes. Here, the basic motion patterns are categorized into movements of looming (proximity), recession, translation, and other irrelevant ones. The presented system is a synthetic neural network, which comprises two complementary sub-systems with four spiking neurons -- the lobula giant movement detectors (LGMD1 and LGMD2) in locusts for sensing looming and recession, and the direction selective neurons (DSN-R and DSN-L) in flies for translational motion extraction. Images are transformed to spikes via spatiotemporal computations towards a switch function and decision making mechanisms, in order to invoke proper robot behaviors amongst collision avoidance, tracking and wandering, in dynamic robot scenes. Our robot experiments demonstrated two main contributions: (1) This neural vision system is effective to recognize the basic motion patterns corresponding to timely and proper robot behaviors in dynamic scenes. (2) The arena tests with multi-robots demonstrated the effectiveness in recognizing more abundant motion features for collision detection, which is a great improvement compared with former studies."

Motivated by these observations, we examine a steady axisymmetric force-free model of a jet driven by the central black hole (BH) with its electromagnetic structure being consistent with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and find that it can produce triple-ridge images even if we assume a simple Gaussian distribution of emitting electrons at the base of the jet. We show that the fluid velocity field associated with the electromagnetic field produces the central ridge component due to the relativistic beaming effect, while the limb-brightened feature arises due to strong magnetic field around the jet edge which also induces the electrons to be dense there. We also show that the computed image strongly depends on the electromagnetic field structure, viewing angle, and parameters related to the electrons' spatial distribution at the jet base. This study will help constraining the non-thermal electron injection mechanism of BH jets and be complementary to theoretical analyses of the upcoming data of Event Horizon Telescope."

We combine this with archival Herschel data to explore the star forming properties of CLJ1449. Using high resolution ALMA and JVLA data we identify potentially confused galaxies, and use the Bayesian inference tool XID+ to estimate fluxes for them. Using archival optical and near infrared data with the energy-balance code CIGALE we calculate star formation rates, and stellar masses for all our cluster members, and find the star formation rate varies between 20-1600M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ over the entire 3Mpc radial range. The central 0.5Mpc region itself has a total star formation rate of 800$\pm$200M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a star formation rate density of (1.2$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{4}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$, which is approximately five orders of magnitude greater than expected field values. When comparing this cluster to those at lower redshifts we find that there is an increase in star formation rate per unit volume towards the centre of the cluster. This indicates that there is indeed a reversal in the star formation/density relation in CLJ1449. Based on the radial star-formation rate density profile, we see evidence for an elevation in the star formation rate density, even out to radii of 3Mpc. At these radii the elevation could be an order of magnitude greater than field values, but the exact number cannot be determined due to ambiguity in the redshift associations. If this is the case it would imply that this cluster is still accreting material which is possibly interacting and undergoing vigorous star-formation."

The major challenge has been to determine whether these materials are fundamentally different from or essentially similar to their hole-doped counterparts; a major opportunity because answering this question would strongly constrain the possible explanations for what is the essential physics that leads to high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates, which is still not agreed upon. Here we argue that experimental results over the past 30 years on electron-doped cuprate materials have provided conclusive answers to these fundamental questions, by establishing that both in hole- and electron-doped cuprates, superconductivity originates in pairing of hole carriers in the same band. We discuss a model to describe this physics that is different from the generally accepted ones, and calculate physical observables that agree with experiment, in particular tunneling characteristics. We argue that our model is simpler, more natural and more compelling than other models. Unlike other models, ours was originally proposed before rather than after many key experiments were performed."

However, there are also increasing concerns regarding the improper use of individual users' private data. Many argue that the technology that customizes our experience in the cyber domain is threatening the fundamental civil right to privacy.   In this paper, we propose PrivacyGuard, a system that leverages smart contract in blockchain and trusted execution environment to enable individuals' control over other parties' access and use of their private data. In our design, smart contracts are used to specify data usage policy (i.e. who can use what data under which conditions along with how the data can be used), while the distributed ledger is used to keep an irreversible and non-repudiable record of data usage. To address the contract execution efficiency problem, as well as to prevent exposing user data on the publicly viewable blockchain, we construct a novel off-chain contract execution engine which realizes trustworthy contract execution off-chain in an trusted execution environment (TEE). By running the contract program inside a hardware-assisted TEE, the proposed off-chain trustworthy contract execution improves system efficiency significantly, as its correctness does not rely on distributed consensus which essentially requires the contract program be executed on all miner nodes. In order to leverage TEE in off-chain execution, PrivacyGuard has to several technical challenges such as synchronous function completion and scalability mitigation in blockchain platform. We build and deploy a prototype of PrivacyGuard using Ethereum and Intel SGX, and our experiments demonstrate the feasibility to support data-intensive applications using data from a large number of users."

Black   Hole Mass Measurements of Six Quasars at 6.1<z<6.7,"We present deep near-infrared spectroscopy of six quasars at 6.1<z<6.7 with VLT/X-Shooter and Gemini-N/GNIRS. Our objects, originally discovered through a wide-field optical survey with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), have the lowest luminosities (-25.5< M1450<-23.1 mag) of the z>5.8 quasars with measured black hole masses. From single-epoch mass measurements based on MgII2798, we find a wide range in black hole masses, from M_BH=10^7.6 to 10^9.3 Msun. The Eddington ratios L_bol/L_Edd range from 0.16 to 1.1, but the majority of the HSC quasars are powered by M_BH=10^9 Msun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting at sub-Eddington rates. The Eddington ratio distribution of the HSC quasars is inclined to lower accretion rates than those of Willott et al. (2010a), who measured the black hole masses for similarly faint z=6 quasars. This suggests that the global Eddington ratio distribution is wider than has previously been thought. The presence of M_BH=10^9 Msun SMBHs at z=6 cannot be explained with constant sub-Eddington accretion from stellar remnant seed black holes. Therefore, we may be witnessing the first buildup of the most massive black holes in the first billion years of the universe, the accretion activity of which is transforming from active growth to a quiescent phase. Measurements of a larger complete sample of z>6 low-luminosity quasars, as well as deeper observations with future facilities will enable us to better understand the early SMBH growth in the reionization epoch."

We show that these subcategories are equivalent to the category of all representations of a smaller grid, modulo a finite number of indecomposables. This equivalence is constructed from a certain cotorsion torsion triple, which is obtained from a tilting subcategory generated by said indecomposables."

Dicke states are an important class of entangled quantum states that among other things serve as starting states for combinatorial optimization quantum algorithms.   We present a deterministic quantum algorithm for the preparation of Dicke states. Implemented as a quantum circuit, our scheme uses $O(kn)$ gates, has depth $O(n)$ and needs no ancilla qubits. The inductive nature of our approach allows for linear-depth preparation of arbitrary symmetric pure states and -- used in reverse -- yields a quasilinear-depth circuit for efficient compression of quantum information in the form of symmetric pure states, improving on existing work requiring quadratic depth. All of these properties even hold for Linear Nearest Neighbor architectures."

The eclipse and pulsation light curves of TIC 309658221 were modeled using an iterative method to obtain a consistent photometric solution. The {\it TESS} target is a circular-orbit, detached binary system with a mass ratio of 0.349, an inclination angle of 80.42 deg, and a temperature difference of 847 K between the components. The primary component of the system lies near the red edge of the $\delta$ Sct instability region on the main-sequence band in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Multiple frequency analyses were applied to the eclipse-subtracted residuals after removing the binary effects in the observed data. These resulted in the detection of 26 frequencies, of which $f_1-f_6$ were independent pulsation frequencies. The 20 other frequencies could be mainly caused by orbital harmonics ($f_8$ and $f_{11}$) or combination frequencies. The period ratios and pulsation constants of the $f_1-f_6$ frequencies are in the ranges of $P_{\rm pul}/P_{\rm orb}$ = 0.010$-$0.013 and Q = 0.027$-$0.036 days, respectively, which are typical of $\delta$ Sct type. The results reveal that TIC 309658221 is an eclipsing $\delta$ Sct star with an orbital period of 7.5952 days and pulsation frequencies of 9.94$-$13.01 day$^{-1}$. This work demonstrates that the 2-min cadence observations of {\it TESS} are very useful for the study of pulsating EBs with multiple frequencies and low amplitudes."

The core idea is to parametrize a distribution on labelled graphs in terms of a Fr\'{e}chet mean graph (which depends on a user-specified choice of metric or graph distance) and a parameter that controls the concentration of this distribution about its mean. Entropy is the natural parameter for such control, varying from a point mass concentrated on the Fr\'{e}chet mean itself to a uniform distribution over all graphs on a given vertex set. We provide a hierarchical Bayesian approach for exploiting this construction, along with straightforward strategies for sampling from the resultant posterior distribution. We conclude by demonstrating the efficacy of our approach via simulation studies and two multiple-network data analysis examples: one drawn from systems biology and the other from neuroscience."

It was revealed that the Faraday rotation varies with thickness of the Cu layers. This dependence of the Faraday rotation on the Cu layer thickness consists of the monotonic component, namely a gradual rise of the angle with increase of the Cu layer thickness, and the non-monotonic one represented by two minima. The monotonic changes of the Faraday rotation were satisfactory described in frames of the effective medium method. Two minima are explained with the Co layers fragmentation due to influence of size electron quantization in the Cu layers on formation of Co clusters during deposition of the films."

We investigated image qualities using ALMA receiver Bands 7, 8, 9, and 10 (285-875 GHz) by adopting band-to-band (B2B) phase referencing in which a phase calibrator is tracked at a lower frequency. For B2B phase referencing, it is expected that a closer phase calibrator to a target can be used, comparing to standard in-band phase referencing. In the first step, it is ensured that an instrumental phase offset difference between low- and high-frequency Bands can be removed using a differential gain calibration in which a phase calibrator is certainly detected while frequency switching. In the next step, comparative experiments are arranged to investigate the image quality between B2B and in-band phase referencing with phase calibrators at various separation angles. In the final step, we conducted long baseline imaging tests for a quasar at 289 GHz in Band 7 and 405 GHz in Band 8 and complex structure sources of HL Tau and VY CMa at ~670 GHz in Band 9. The B2B phase referencing was successfully applied, allowing us to achieve an angular resolution of 14x11 and 10x8 mas for HL Tau and VY CMa, respectively. There is a high probability of finding a low-frequency calibrator within 5.4 deg in B2B phase referencing, bright enough to use an 8 s scan length combined with a 7.5 GHz bandwidth."

The main obstacles presently prohibiting its routine use in quantitative vadose zone hydrology are the superposition of signals arising from various source mechanisms, difficult-to-predict electrode polarization effects that depend on electrode design and age, as well as water saturation, pore water chemistry, clay content, and temperature in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. We present a unique long-term SP monitoring experiment focusing on the first four years of data acquired at different depths in the vadose zone within the HOBE hydrological observatory in Denmark. Using state-of-the-art SP theory combined with flow and transport simulations, we attempt to replicate the observed data and suggest reasons for observed discrepancies. The predictions are overall satisfactory during the first six months of monitoring after which both the patterns and magnitudes of the observed data change drastically. Our main observations are (1) that predicted SP magnitudes are strongly sensitive to how the effective excess charge scales with water saturation implying that continued research is needed to build more accurate models of electrokinetic phenomena in unsaturated conditions, (2) that significant changes in electrode polarization occur in the shallowest electrodes at time scales of a year, suggesting that electrode effects cannot be ignored and that explicit electrode modeling should be considered in future monitoring studies, and (3) that multi-rate mass transfer and reactive transport modeling are needed to better predict salinity and pore water conductivity. We hope to stimulate other researchers to test new SP modeling approaches and interpretation strategies against these data by making the SP and complimentary data time-series available."

We can use this for coherent manipulation of single-quantum bits and single-photon sources. The trapping lifetime of the atoms in the optical tweezers is very short due to the impact of the background atoms, the laser intensity fluctuation of optical tweezer and the residual thermal motion of the atoms. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of the background pressure, the trap frequency of optical tweezers and the parametric heating of the optical tweezer on the atomic trapping lifetime. Combined with the external feedback loop based on an acousto-optical modulator (AOM), the intensity fluctuation of the 1064-nm laser in the time domain was suppressed from $\pm$ 3.360$\%$ to $\pm$ 0.064$\%$, and the suppression bandwidth reached approximately 33 kHz. The trapping lifetime of a single Cs atom in the microscopic optical tweezer was extended from 4.04 s to 6.34 s."

In this paper, we corroborate based on three subjective experiments on a novel image dataset that objects in natural images are inherently perceived to have varying levels of importance. Our dataset, named SalMoN (saliency in multi-object natural images), has 588 images containing multiple objects. The subjective experiments performed record spontaneous attention and perception through eye fixation duration, point clicking and rectangle drawing. As object saliency in a multi-object image is inherently multi-level, we propose that salient object detection must be evaluated for the capability to detect all multi-level salient objects apart from the salient object class detection capability. For this purpose, we generate multi-level maps as ground truth corresponding to all the dataset images using the results of the subjective experiments, with the labels being multi-level salient objects and background. We then propose the use of mean absolute error, Kendall's rank correlation and average area under precision-recall curve to evaluate existing salient object detection methods on our multi-level saliency ground truth dataset. Approaches that represent saliency detection on images as local-global hierarchical processing of a graph perform well in our dataset."

The Largest Broad Absorption Line Acceleration,"We present an analysis of the broad absorption line (BAL) velocity shift that appeared in one of the outflow systems in quasar SDSS J1042+1646. Observations were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph in 2011 and 2017 in the 500 -- 1050 $\r{A}$ rest frame. The outflow's velocity centroid shifted by $\sim$ --1550 km s$^{-1}$ from --19,500 km s$^{-1}$ to --21,050 km s$^{-1}$ over a rest-frame time of 3.2 yr. The velocity shift signatures are most apparent in the absorption features from the Ne VIII $\lambda\lambda$ 770.41, 780.32 doublet and are supported by the absorption troughs from OV $\lambda$ 629.73 and the Mg X $\lambda\lambda$ 609.79, 624.94 doublet. This is the first time where a quasar outflow velocity shift is observed in troughs from more than one ion and in distinct troughs from a doublet transition (Ne VIII). We attribute the velocity shift to an acceleration of an existing outflow as we are able to exclude photoionization changes and motion of material into and out of the line of sight as alternate explanations. This leads to an average acceleration of 480 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ (1.52 cm s$^{-2}$) in the quasar rest frame. Both the acceleration and the absolute velocity shift are the largest reported for a quasar outflow to date. Based on the absorption troughs of the O V* multiplet, we derive a range for the distance of the outflow ($R$) from the central source, 0.05 pc $<$ $R$ $<$ 54.3 pc. This outflow shows similarities with the fast X-ray outflow detected in quasar PG 1211+143. We use the acceleration and velocity shift to constrain radiatively accelerated active galactic nucleus disk-wind models and use them to make predictions for future observations."

The outflows are detected as absorption troughs from both high-ionization species, including N III, O III, and S IV, and very high-ionization species, including Ar VIII, Ne VIII, and Na IX. The derived photoionization solutions show that each outflow requires a two ionization-phase solution. For S1, troughs from S IV* and S IV allow us to derive an electron number density, $n_{e}$ = 1.8$\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, and its distance from the central source of $R$ = 270 pc. For S2, troughs from O III* and O III yield $n_{e}$ = 1.2$\times$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ and $R$ = 1600 pc. The kinetic luminosity of S2 is $>$ 12% of the Eddington luminosity for the quasar and therefore can provide strong AGN feedback effects. Comparison of absorption troughs from O III and O VI in both outflow systems supports the idea that for a given element, higher ionization ions have larger covering fractions than lower ionization ones."

In agreement with previous experiments we confirm that superconductivity disappears near a critical pressure $p_{\rm c} \approx 1.5$~GPa, and a magnetically ordered state appears. The unusual $H_{\rm c2}(T)$ at low temperatures for $H \parallel a$ suggests that the multiple superconducting phases which appear under pressure have quite different $H_{\rm c2}$. For a field applied along the hard magnetization $b$ axis $H_{\rm c2} (0)$ is glued to the metamagnetic transition $H_{\rm m}$ which is suppressed near $p_{\rm c}$. The suppression of $H_{\rm m}$ with pressure follows the decrease of temperature $T_{\chi}^{\rm max}$, at the maximum in the susceptibility along $b$. The strong reinforcement of $H_{\rm c2}$ at ambient pressure for $H \parallel b$ above 16~T is rapidly suppressed under pressure due to the increase of $T_{\rm sc}$ and the decrease of $H_{\rm m}$. The change in the hierarchy of the anisotropy of $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ on approaching $p_{\rm c}$ points out that the $c$ axis becomes the hard magnetization axis."

Blazar S5 0716+71 at microarcsecond resolution,"We present RadioAstron Space VLBI imaging observations of the BL Lac object S5 0716+71 made on January 3-4 2015 at a frequency of 22 GHz (wavelength $\lambda=1.3$ cm). The observations were made in the framework of the AGN Polarization Key Science Program. The source was detected on projected space-ground baselines up to 70 833 km (5.6 Earth diameters) for both, parallel hand and cross-hand interferometric visibilities. We have used these detections to obtain a full-polarimetric image of the blazar at an unprecedented angular resolution of 24 $\mu$as, the highest for this source to date. This enabled us to estimate the size of the radio core to be $<12\times5~\mu$as and to reveal a complex structure and a significant curvature of the blazar jet in the inner 100 $\mu$as, which is an indication that the jet viewing angle lies inside the opening angle of the jet conical outflow. Fairly highly (15%) linearly polarized emission is detected in a jet region of 19 $\mu$as in size, located 58 $\mu$as downstream from the core. The highest brightness temperature in the source frame is estimated to be $>2.2\times10^{13}$ K for the blazar core. This implies that the inverse Compton limit must be violated in the rest frame of the source, even for the largest Doppler factor $\delta\thicksim25$ reported for 0716+714."

Subsequently, model repositories like Thingiverse became important tools in (novice) makers' processes. They allow them to shorten or even omit the design process, offloading a majority of the effort to other parties. However, steps like measurement of surrounding constraints (e.g., clearance) which exist only inside the users' environment, can not be similarly outsourced. We propose Mix&Match a mixed-reality-based system which allows users to browse model repositories, preview the models in-situ, and adapt them to their environment in a simple and immediate fashion. Mix&Match aims to provide users with CSG operations which can be based on both virtual and real geometry. We present interaction patterns and scenarios for Mix&Match, arguing for the combination of mixed reality and model repositories. This enables almost modelling-free personal fabrication for both novices and expert makers."

In that context, localization by learning matchable image features is gaining popularity due to recent advances in machine learning. Features that uniquely describe the visual contents of images have a wide range of applications, including image retrieval and understanding. In this work, we propose a method that learns image features targeted for image-retrieval-based localization. Retrieval-based localization has several benefits, such as easy maintenance and quick computation. However, the state-of-the-art features only provide visual similarity scores which do not explicitly reveal the geometric distance between query and retrieved images. Knowing this distance is highly desirable for accurate localization, especially when the reference images are sparsely distributed in the scene. Therefore, we propose a novel loss function for learning image features which are both visually representative and geometrically relatable. This is achieved by guiding the learning process such that the feature and geometric distances between images are directly proportional. In our experiments we show that our features not only offer significantly better localization accuracy, but also allow to estimate the trajectory of a query sequence in absence of the reference images."

These attributes have led to numerous demonstrations of field-effect devices ranging from transistors to triodes. By exploiting the controlled, substitutional doping schemes in covalently-bonded, three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors and the passivated surfaces of 2D semiconductors, one can construct devices that can exceed performance metrics of 'all-2D' vdW heterojunctions. Here, we demonstrate, 2D/3D semiconductor heterojunctions using MoS2 as the prototypical 2D semiconductor laid upon Si and GaN as the 3D semiconductor layers. By tuning the Fermi levels in MoS2, we demonstrate devices that concurrently exhibit over seven orders of magnitude modulation in rectification ratios and conductance. Our results further suggest that the interface quality does not necessarily affect Fermi-level tuning at the junction opening up possibilities for novel 2D/3D heterojunction device architectures."

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy.

This facility aims at accelerating the materials research in a highly efficient way, by advanced high-throughput film synthesis techniques and subsequent fast characterization of surface morphology and electronic states. Compared with uniform films deposited by conventional methods, the so-called combinatorial thin films will be beneficial to determining the accurate phase diagrams of different materials due to the improved control of parameters such as chemical substitution and sample thickness resulting from a rotarymask method. A specially designed STM working under low-temperature and ultra-high vacuum conditions is optimized for the characterization of combinatorial thin films, in an XY coarse motion range of 15 mm $\times$ 15 mm and with sub-micrometer location precision. The overall configuration as well as some key aspects like sample holder design, scanner head, and sample/tip/target transfer mechanism are described in detail. The performance of the device is demonstrated by synthesizing high-quality superconducting FeSe thin films with gradient thickness, imaging surfaces of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, Au (111), Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) and FeSe.

We evaluate the performance of four SE-specific tools in a cross-platform setting, i.e., on a test set collected from data sources different from the one used for training. We find that (i) the lexicon-based tools outperform the supervised approaches retrained in a cross-platform setting and (ii) retraining can be beneficial in within-platform settings in the presence of robust gold standard datasets, even using a minimal training set. Based on our empirical findings, we derive guidelines for reliable use of sentiment analysis tools in software engineering."

Most often, the fractional anisotropy (FA) is used, but several alternative DAIs have been introduced in attempts to maximize the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in diffusion anisotropy maps. Examples include the scaled relative anisotropy (sRA), the gamma variate anisotropy index (GV), the surface anisotropy (UAsurf), and the lattice index (LI). With the advent of multidimensional diffusion encoding it became possible to determine the presence of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a voxel, which is theoretically independent of orientation coherence. In accordance with DTI, the microscopic anisotropy is typically quantified by the microscopic fractional anisotropy (uFA). In this work, in addition to the uFA, the four microscopic diffusion anisotropy indices (uDAIs) usRA, uGV, uUAsurf, and uLI are defined in analogy to the respective DAIs by means of the average diffusion tensor and the covariance tensor. Simulations with three representative distributions of microscopic diffusion tensors revealed distinct CNR differences when differentiating between isotropic and microscopically anisotropic diffusion. q-Space trajectory imaging (QTI) was employed to acquire brain in-vivo maps of all indices. For this purpose, a 15 min protocol featuring linear, planar, and spherical tensor encoding was used. The resulting maps were of good quality and exhibited different contrasts, e.g. between gray and white matter. This indicates that it may be beneficial to use more than one uDAI in future investigational studies."

One major driver for the rapid spatial spread of diseases is human mobility. In particular, the travel patterns of individuals determine their spreading potential to a great extent. These travel behaviors can be captured and modelled using novel location-based data sources, e.g., smart travel cards, social media, etc. Previous studies have shown that individuals who cannot be characterized by their most frequently visited locations spread diseases farther and faster; however, these studies are based on GPS data and mobile call records which have position uncertainty and do not capture explicit contacts. It is unclear if the same conclusions hold for large scale real-world transport networks. In this paper, we investigate how mobility patterns impact disease spread in a large-scale public transit network of empirical data traces. In contrast to previous findings, our results reveal that individuals with mobility patterns characterized by their most frequently visited locations and who typically travel large distances pose the highest spreading risk."

The methodology first finds the order in which to search the dimensions, and then, performs the search using a modified projection method. In order to determine the dimension order, the algorithm uses the k-vector, a range searching technique for one dimension that identifies the number of elements contained in the searching range. Then, using this information, the algorithm predicts and selects the best approach to deal with each dimension. The algorithm has a worst case complexity of $\mathcal{O}(nd(k/n)^{2/d})$, where $k$ is the number of elements retrieved, $n$ is the number of elements in the database, and $d$ is the number of dimensions of the database. This work includes a detailed description of the methodology as well as a study of the algorithm performance."

The proposed approach is based on an optimal version of the k-vector range searching, an ad-hoc modification devised for function inversion. The optimality consists of retrieving always the same number of data ($1,2,\dots$) for a specified searching range to initiate the root solver. This provides flexibility to adapt the technique to a variety of root solvers (e.g., bisection, Newton, etc.), using a specified number of starting points. The proposed method allows to build an inverse function toolbox for a set of specified nonlinear functions. In particular, the method is suitable when intensive inversions of the same function are required. The inversion is extremely fast (almost instantaneous), but it requires a one-time preprocessing effort."

Here, we utilize a single-pass optical parametric amplifier (OPA) based on a single-spatial-mode periodically poled ZnO:LiNbO3 waveguide, which is directly bonded onto a LiTaO3 substrate. The single-pass OPA allows THz bandwidth, and the absence of higher-order spatial modes in the single-spatial-mode structure helps to avoid degradation of squeezing. In addition, the directly bonded ZnO-doped waveguide has durability for high-power pump and shows small photorefractive damage. Using this waveguide, we observe CW 6.3-dB squeezing at 20-MHz sideband by balanced homodyne detection. This is the first realization of CW squeezing with a single-pass OPA at a level exceeding 4.5 dB, which is required for the generation of a two-dimensional cluster state. Furthermore, the squeezed light shows 2.5-THz spectral bandwidth. The squeezed light will lead to the development of a high-speed on-chip quantum processor using TDM with a centimeter-order optical delay line."

A pair of secondary users (SUs) is considered in which one SU facilitates relay cooperation for communications between two primary users (PUs). In return, SUs make use of primary users' signals for energy harvesting (EH) and realize their own communications. In such a network, end-to-end bidirectional communications between the two PUs and unidirectional information exchange between the SUs can be performed in three phases. A power splitting (PS) based approach is adopted for enabling SWIPT. The relaying SU applies an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol to broadcast primary and secondary signals, whereas the PUs perform selection combining to access the active direct link. Accurate expressions of the outage probability (OP) and throughput are derived for the primary system by considering a nonlinear energy harvester at the relaying SU under Nakagami-m fading"

The flux of secondary neutrons varies with latitude, elevation, solar activity, and nearby material, including ground moisture. We report the results from a campaign to measure count rates in neutron detectors responding to three different energy ranges conducted near the geomagnetic North Pole at CFS Alert, Nunavut, Canada (82.5 degrees , 62.5 degrees W; vertical geomagnetic cutoff rigidity, RC = 0 GV) in June of 2016. In November 2016, we performed a follow-on measurement campaign in southern Canada at similar RC (1.5 GV) and elevations. We conducted these measurements, at varying elevation and ground moisture content, with unmoderated and moderated 3He detectors for thermal and epithermal-to-MeV sensitivity, and with EJ-299-33 pulse shape discrimination plastic scintillator detectors for fast neutrons. Background gamma rays were monitored with NaI(Tl) detectors. Using these data sets, we compared the measured count rates to a predictive model. This is the first ever data set taken from this location on Earth. We find that for the thermal and epithermal-to-MeV neutron measurements the predictive model and data are in good agreement, except at one location on rock-covered ground near 1 km elevation. The discrepancy at that location may be attributable to ground moisture variability. Other measurements, during this campaign and prior, support the assertion that ground moisture plays a critical role in determining neutron flux."

We show that it can also be used to probe another key disk property -- the temperature gradient -- along sight lines that are optically thick, independent of the grain alignment mechanism. We first illustrate the technique analytically using a simple 1D slab model, which yields an approximate formula that relates the polarization fraction to the temperature gradient with respect to the optical depth tau at the tau=1 surface. The formula is then validated using models of stellar irradiated disks with and without accretion heating. The promises and challenges of the technique are illustrated with a number of Class 0 and I disks with ALMA dust polarization data, including NGC 1333 IRAS4A1, IRAS 16293B, BHB 07-11, L1527, HH 212 and HH 111. We find, in particular, that the sight lines passing through the near-side of a highly inclined disk trace different temperature gradient directions than those through the far-side, which can lead to a polarization orientation on the near-side that is orthogonal to that on the far-side, and that the HH 111 disk may be such a case. Our technique for probing the disk temperature gradient through dust polarization can complement other methods, particularly those using molecular lines."

Taking into account that a person's expectation is an important aspect of the perception of space, we exploit the theory of Bayesian Surprise to robustly model expectation and thus surprise in the context of building structures. We use Isovist Analysis, which is a popular space syntax technique, to turn qualitative object attributes into quantitative environmental information. Since isovists are location-specific patterns of visibility, a sequence of isovists describes the spatial perception during a movement along multiple points in space. We then use Bayesian Surprise in a feature space consisting of these isovist readings. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach, we take ""snapshots"" of an agent's local environment to provide a short list of images that characterize a traversed trajectory through a 2D indoor environment. Those fingerprints represent surprising regions of a tour, characterize the traversed map and enable indoor LBS to focus more on important regions. Given this idea, we propose to use ""surprise"" as a new dimension of context in indoor location-based services (LBS). Agents of LBS, such as mobile robots or non-player characters in computer games, may use the context surprise to focus more on important regions of a map for a better use or understanding of the floor plan."

B-spline interpolation (BSI) is a popular technique in the context of medical imaging due to its adaptability and robustness in 3D object modeling. A field that utilizes BSI is Image Guided Surgery (IGS). IGS provides navigation using medical images, which can be segmented and reconstructed into 3D models, often through BSI. Image registration tasks also use BSI to align pre-operative data to intra-operative data. However, such IGS tasks are computationally demanding, especially when applied to 3D medical images, due to the complexity and amount of data involved. Therefore, optimization of IGS algorithms is greatly desirable, for example, to perform image registration tasks intra-operatively and to enable real-time applications. A traditional CPU does not have sufficient computing power to achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel GPU implementation of BSI to accelerate the calculation of the deformation field in non-rigid image registration algorithms.   Methods. Our BSI implementation on GPUs minimizes the data that needs to be moved between memory and processing cores during loading of the input grid, and leverages the large on-chip GPU register file for reuse of input values. Moreover, we re-formulate our method as trilinear interpolations to reduce computational complexity and increase accuracy. To provide pre-clinical validation of our method and demonstrate its benefits in medical applications, we integrate our improved BSI into a registration workflow for compensation of liver deformation (caused by pneumoperitoneum, i.e., inflation of the abdomen) and evaluate its performance.   Results. Our approach improves the performance of BSI by an average of 6.5x and interpolation accuracy by 2x compared to three state-of-the-art GPU implementations. We observe up to 34% acceleration of non-rigid image registration."

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the usability of Mobile Health applications in Bangladesh.   Method: We followed a 3-stage approach in our research. First, we conducted a keyword-based application search in the popular app stores. We followed the affinity diagram approach and clustered the found applications into nine groups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in total) and conducted a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest downloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30 participants.   Results: We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature from heuristic inspection. The most (21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and minimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale (SUS) scores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the heuristic evaluation. Thus, the results of heuristic evaluation and user studies complement each other.   Conclusion: Overall, the findings suggest that the usability of the mobile health apps in Bangladesh is not satisfactory in general and could be a potential barrier for wider adoption of mobile health services."

One approach to creating qubits is introducing paramagnetic defects into semiconductors or insulators. This class of qubits has seen success in the form of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, divacancy defects in SiC, and P doped into Si. These materials feature paramagnetic defects in a low nuclear spin environment to reduce the impact of nuclear spin on electronic spin coherence. In this work, we report single crystal growth of Ba$_2$CaWO$_{6-\delta}$, and the coherence properties of controllably introduced W$^{5+}$ spin centers generated by oxygen vacancies. Ba$_2$CaWO$_{6-\delta}$ ($\delta$ = 0) is a B-site ordered double perovskite with a temperature-dependent octahedral tilting wherein oxygen vacancies generate W$^{5+}$ (d$^1$), $S = \frac{1}{2}, I$ = 0, centers. We characterized these defects by measuring the spin-lattice ($T_1$) and spin-spin relaxation ($T_2$) times from T = 5 to 150 K. At T = 5 K, $T_1$ = 310 ms and $T_2$ = 4 $\mu$s, establishing the viability of these qubit candidates. With increasing temperature, $T_2$ remains constant up to T = 60 K and then decreases to $T_2$ $\approx$ 1 $\mu$s at T = 90 K, and remains roughly constant until T = 150 K, demonstrating the remarkable stability of $T_2$ with increasing temperature. Together, these results demonstrate that controlled defect generation in double perovskite structures can generate viable paramagnetic point centers for quantum applications and expand the field of potential materials for QIS."

The peculiarity of this system lies in the simplicity of this type of molecular system in which two near levels can be connected by allowed electric dipole transition with considerable value of the dipole moment transition and negligible spontaneous emission because the transition is in the microwave or far-infrared range. These properties give place to entanglement states oscillating by free evolution with frequency determined by the dipole-dipole interaction and negligible spontaneous decay, which allows to consider an efficient quantum Zeno effect by frequent measurements of one of the entangled states. If the molecules are initially both in the upper (or lower) eigenstate, the system evolves under an external radiation field, which can induce oscillations of the generated entangled states, with frequency of the order of the Rabi frequency of the field. For a certain detuning, a symmetric entangled state, eigenstate of the collective system can be populated, and given its negligible spontaneous emission, could be maintained for a time only limited by external decoherence processes which could be minimized. Although the data used are those of the $NH_3$ molecule, other molecules could present the same advantageous features."

This study focuses on the modelling of functioning data from a 32 kWe dish-Stirling solar plant installed at a facility test site on the University of Palermo campus, in Southern Italy. The proposed model, based on real monitored data, the energy balance of the collector and the partial load efficiency of the Stirling engine, can be used easily to simulate the annual energy production of such systems, making use of the solar radiation database, with the aim of encouraging a greater commercialisation of this technology. Introducing further simplifying assumptions based on our experimental data, the model can be linearised providing a new analytical expression of the parameters that characterise the widely used Stine empirical model. The model was calibrated against data corresponding to the collector with clean mirrors and used to predict the net electric production of the dish-Stirling accurately. A numerical method for assessing the daily level of mirror soiling without the use of direct reflectivity measures was also defined. The proposed methodology was used to evaluate the history of mirror soiling for the observation period, which shows a strong correlation with the recorded sequence of rains and dust depositions. The results of this study emphasise how desert dust transport events, frequent occurrences in parts of the Mediterranean, can have a dramatic impact on the electric power generation of dish-Stirling plants."

In the original model, each voter changes its opinion with a certain probability $\epsilon$ if the group of influence is not unanimous. In contrast, the modified version introduces two types of voters that act in a deterministic way in case of disagreement in the influence group: the fraction $\epsilon$ of voters always change their current opinion, whereas the rest of them always maintain it. Although both concepts of randomness lead to the same average number of opinion changes in the system on the microscopic level, they cause qualitatively distinct results on the macroscopic level. We focus on the mean-field description of these models. Our approach relies on the stability analysis by the linearization technique developed within dynamical system theory. This approach allows us to derive complete, exact phase diagrams for both models. The results obtained in this paper indicate that quenched randomness promotes continuous phase transitions to a greater extent, whereas annealed randomness favors discontinuous ones. The quenched model also creates combinations of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions unobserved in the annealed model, in which the up-down symmetry may be spontaneously broken inside or outside the hysteresis loop. The analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations carried out on a complete graph."

Universes may not always be known, though, or may only described by assumptions such as ""small universes are more likely"". Without a universe, inference is no longer possible for lifted algorithms, losing their advantage of tractable inference. The aim of this paper is to define a semantics for models with unknown universes decoupled from a specific constraint language to enable lifted and thereby, tractable inference."

It is shown that the treatment of V2O5 in low-temperature RF hydrogen plasma for 1 to 10 min. leads to either hydration of vanadium pentoxide or its reduction (depending on the treatment conditions) to lower vanadium oxides. For some samples, which are subject to plasma treatment in the discharge active zone, a non-ordinary temperature dependence of resistance, with a maxi-mum at T ~ 100 K, is observed. For W-doped VO2 films, it is shown that substitution of V4+ with W6+ results in a decrease of the temperature of metal-insulator transition. Also, it has been shown that the doping of the initial films with ~3 at.% of W reduces the statistical scatter in the thresh-old parameters of the switching devices with S-shaped I-V characteristics on the basis of V2O5 gel films."

II. detection of five new planets,   eight planet candidates, and confirmation of three planets around nine nearby   M dwarfs","Zechmeister et al. (2009) surveyed 38 nearby M dwarfs from March 2000 to March 2007 with VLT2 and the UVES spectrometer. This data has recently been reanalyzed (Butler et al. 2019), yielding a significant improvement in the Doppler velocity precision. Spurred by this, we have combined the UVES data with velocity sets from HARPS, Magellan/PFS, and Keck/HIRES. Sixteen planet candidates have been uncovered orbiting nine M dwarfs. Five of them are new planets corresponding to radial velocity signals, which are not sensitive to the choice of noise models and are identified in multiple data sets over various timespans. Eight candidate planets require additional observation to be confirmed. We also confirm three previously reported planets. Among the new planets, GJ 180 d and GJ 229A c are super-Earths located in the conservative habitable zones of their host stars. We investigate their dynamical stability using the Monte Carlo approach and find both planetary orbits are robust to the gravitational perturbations of the companion planets. Due to their proximity to the Sun, the angular separation between the host stars and the potentially habitable planets in these two systems is 25 and 59 mas, respectively. They are thus good candidates for future direct imaging by JWST and E-ELT. In addition we find GJ 433 c, a cold super-Neptune belonging to an unexplored population of Neptune-like planets. With a separation of 0.5 as from its host star, GJ 433 c is probably the first realistic candidate for direct imaging of cold Neptunes.

Here we report on Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations of a blazar J0906+6930 at z = 5.47, which enabled the detection of polarised emission and measurement of jet proper motion at parsec scales. The observations suggest a less powerful jet compared with the general blazar population, including lower proper motion and bulk Lorentz factor. This coupled with a previously inferred high accretion rate indicate a transition from an accretion radiative power to a jet mechanical power based transfer of energy and momentum to the surrounding gas.While alternative scenarios could not be fully ruled out, our results indicate a possibly nascent jet embedded in and interacting with a dense medium resulting in a jet bending."

If n is two, we consider a two-setting Bell experiment. If n is three, we consider a three-setting Bell experiment. Twosetting model is an explicit local realistic model for the values of a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell experiment. Three-setting model is an explicit local realistic model for the values of a correlation function, given in a three-setting Bell experiment. In the non-contextual scenario, there is not the difference between three-setting model and two-setting model. And we cannot classify local realistic theories in this case. This says that we can construct three-setting model from two-setting model. Surprisingly we can discuss incompleteness in the Bell theorem using non-contextual model. On the other hand, in the contextual scenario, there is the difference between three-setting model and two-setting model. This says that we must distinguish three-setting model from two-setting model. And we can classify local realistic theories in this case."

The zwitterionic dodecyldimethylamine oxide (DDAO) has been used as a cosurfactant. As representatives of the vegetable and mineral oils, sunflower seed oil and light mineral oil have been used. The process of oil drop detachment from the solid substrates (roll-up mechanism) has been monitored. In the case of porcelain, excellent cleaning of oil is achieved by mixed solutions of SME and DDAO. In the case of stainless steel, excellent cleaning (superior than that by linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and sodium lauryl ether sulfate) is provided by binary and ternary mixtures of SMEs, which may contain also DDAO. For the studied systems, the good cleaning correlates neither with the oil/water interfacial tension, nor with the surfactant chainlength and headgroup type. The data imply that governing factors might be the thickness and morphology of admicelle layers formed on the solid/water interface. The results indicate that the SME mixtures represent a promising system for formulations in house-hold detergency, having in mind also other useful properties of SME, such as biodegradability, skin compatibility and hard water tolerance."

The radiometric aerial survey technique has been extensively applied following reactor accidents and also would provide a key tool for response to a malicious radiological or nuclear incident. Methods exist to calibrate the aerial survey system for quantification of the concentration of natural radionuclides, which can provide guidance. However, these methods have anticipated a spatial distribution of the source which is large in comparison to the survey altitude. In rapid emergency-response aerial surveys of areas of safety concern, deposits of relatively small spatial extent may be expected. The activity of such spatially restricted hot spots is underestimated using the traditional methods. We present here a spatial deconvolution method which can recover some of the variation smoothed out by the averaging due to survey at altitude. We show that the method can recover the true spatial distribution of concentration of a synthetic source. We then apply the method to real aerial survey data collected following detonation of a radiological dispersal device. The findings and implications of the deconvolution are then discussed by reference to a groundbased truckborne survey over the same contamination."

The SCoTSS development program has reached a technology readiness level of eight, and we are proceeding with field trials of the instrument in high-fidelity operational environments. Prospective end users have been involved in trial set up and execution, assuring applicability in their mission spaces. SCoTSS has been subject to trials involving hidden sources, heavily shielded sources, imager moving with respect to source, and complicated man-made surroundings. Our operators value high sensitivity for anomaly geolocation and mapping. End users also require an instrument which is capable of direction reconstruction in motion, as well as rapid imaging of a field of view. We have developed a ""time to image"" measure which allows for quantitative comparison of imagers of fundamentally different technology, where one design may have an advantage in terms of energy resolution and compactness and another design may have an advantage in terms of efficiency and cost effectiveness. We present here the performance of the SCoTSS imager in rapid direction finding. As well, we compare the time to image quantity for the SCoTSS imager and the H3D Polaris-H Quad imager where the data were taken under equivalent conditions. This quantitative measure of imaging performance can allow operators to make an informed choice of the design that meets their needs taking into consideration also weight and size as well as budgetary constraints."

Assuming that the UEs are intermittently active, this problem can be addressed by a shared access to the pilots and a suitable random access (RA) protocol. The strongest-user collision resolution (SUCRe) is a previously proposed RA protocol that often privileges the UEs closer to the base station (BS). In contrast, we propose a novel RA protocol using a decentralized pilot power allocation method that aims at a fairer performance. The proposed access class barring with power control (ACBPC) protocol allows each UE to estimate, without additional overhead, how many UEs collided for the chosen pilot and calculate an ACB factor, which is then used to determine the pilot retransmission probability in the next protocol step. The results show that the proposed ACBPC protocol is superior to SUCRe in terms of providing a fair connectivity for very crowded networks, although still being distributed and uncoordinated as the original SUCRe protocol."

Our main contribution is the identification of appropriate multimodal features and the integration of such features into verbatim conversation transcripts. We demonstrate the ability of our system to take in a wide range of multimodal information and automatically generated a prediction score for the depression state of the individual. Our experiments showed that this approach yielded better performance than the baseline model. Furthermore, the multimodal narrative approach makes it easy to integrate learnings from other disciplines, such as conversational analysis and psychology. Lastly, this interdisciplinary and automated approach is a step towards emulating how practitioners record the course of treatment as well as emulating how conversational analysts have been analyzing conversations by hand."

We present a joint experiment--theory analysis of the temperature-dependent emission spectra, zero-phonon linewidth, and second-order correlation function of light emitted from a single molecule. We observe spectra with a zero-phonon-line together with several additional sharp peaks, broad phonon sidebands, and a strongly temperature dependent homogeneous broadening. Our model includes both localised vibrational modes of the molecule and a thermal phonon bath, which we include non-perturbatively, and is able capture all observed features. For resonant driving we measure Rabi oscillations that become increasingly damped with temperature, which our model naturally reproduces. Our results constitute an essential characterisation of the photon coherence of these promising molecules, paving the way towards their use in future quantum information applications."

The propagation and direction of the turbulent flow are sustained by a support beam on distances an order of magnitude longer than previously reported. This novel technique is a powerful tool for the controlled generation and propagation of quantum turbulences and paves the way to the study of the hydrodynamic of quantum turbulence in driven-dissipative 2D polariton systems."

The FT methodology seems to be especially suitable for laboratory practice sessions: before the lab session the students are given documents and videos that explain the theoretical contents and the experimental procedure. When this material is studied in advance, the practice session can be devoted to the discussion, clarification and practical application of the acquired knowledge. This paper describes the effect of the FT methodology on the students' academic performance when it was applied to the laboratory practice in two subjects, Physics and Electricity, of a technical degree. The laboratory and final grades of these subjects were compared in four consecutive years. The characteristics of all four years were quite similar, except that the traditional teaching method (TM) was used in two, while FT was applied in the other two. The statistical analysis shows that the academic results of the students were better in both subjects under FT than those obtained using TM, and that the difference was statistically significant."

Many interesting behaviors of dressed photons are known, especially the rapid energy transfer and the accumulation to singular points, e.g., points with strong dissipation.

Within this frequency window, the materials exhibit nondispersive and low-loss optical responses. At low temperatures, significant THz Faraday rotations are found in the (S)GGG samples.

Based on spectral modeling of integral field spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey, we derive mass- and light-weighted stellar age gradients ($\nabla$(t,B)L,M) within the photometrically determined bulge radius (RB) of a representative sample of local face-on late-type galaxies that span 2.6 dex in stellar mass. Our analysis documents a trend for decreasing $\nabla$(t,B)L,M with increasing M,T, with high-mass bulges predominantly showing negative age gradients and vice versa. The inversion from positive to negative $\nabla$(t,B)L,M occurs at logM,T ~ 10, which roughly coincides with the transition from lower-mass bulges whose gas excitation is powered by SF to bulges classified as Composite, LINER or Seyfert. We discuss two limiting cases for the origin of radial age gradients in massive LTG bulges. The first assumes that the stellar age in the bulge is initially spatially uniform, thus the observed age gradients arise from an inside-out SF quenching (ioSFQ) front that is radially expanding with a mean velocity vq. In this case, the age gradients translate into a slow ioSFQ that lasts until z~2, suggesting mild negative feedback by SF or an AGN. If negative age gradients in massive bulges are not due to ioSFQ but primarily due to their inside-out formation process, then the standard hypothesis of quasi-monolithic bulge formation has to be discarded in favor of a scenario that involves gradual buildup of stellar mass over 2-3 Gyr through, e.g., inside-out SF and inward migration of SF clumps from the disk. In this case, rapid AGN-driven ioSFQ cannot be ruled out."

The HARPS spectrograph provides state-of-the-art stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are computed by CCF with a numerical mask. Aims. The aim of this study is three-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is < 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three significant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software used for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1 m/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few m/s. In addition, we find small (< 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type stars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products."

In particular, an increase of weather and climate extremes can lead to increased stress on human and natural systems, and a tendency for serious adverse effects. We rely on the EURO-CORDEX simulations and focus on the the screen-level daily mean temperature (T2m). We compare the shifting velocities of the cold and hot extremes with these of the associated central trends, i.e., the arithmetical mean or median. We define the extremes relative to the T2m distribution as it evolves with time over the period of 1951--2100. We find that temperature extremes shift at a similar velocity compared to that of the central trends. Accordingly, the T2m probability distribution shifts mostly as a whole, as the tails of the distribution increase together with the central trends. Exceptions occur however in specific regions and for the clustering of warm days, which shifts slower than all other extremes investigated in this study."

The use of scaling expansions is a natural way to measure the asymptotic growth of the configuration space volume in terms of the scaling exponents of the system. These scaling exponents can, in turn, be used to define universality classes that uniquely determine the statistics of a system. Every system belongs to one of these classes. Here we derive the information geometry of scaling expansions of sample spaces. In particular, we present the deformed logarithms and the metric in a systematic and coherent way. We observe a phase transition for the curvature. The phase transition can be well measured by the characteristic length r, corresponding to a ball with radius 2r having the same curvature as the statistical manifold. Increasing characteristic length with respect to the size of the system is associated with sub-exponential sample space growth is associated with strongly constrained and correlated complex systems. Decreasing of the characteristic length corresponds to super-exponential sample space growth that occurs for example in systems that develop structure as they evolve. Constant curvature means exponential sample space growth that is associated with multinomial statistics, and traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs, or Shannon statistics applies. This allows us to characterize transitions between statistical manifolds corresponding to different families of probability distributions."

These spin textures are stabilized by a competition between ferromagnetic exchange and antisymmetric Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange, which is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling associated with high-atomic-number elements. For real-world application, it is desirable to find materials that can host compact skyrmion lattices at readily accessible temperatures. Here, we report on the crystal chemistry and magnetic phase diagrams of a family of compounds with the filled $\beta$-Mn structure, FePd$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Mo$_3$N with $T_C$ ranging from 175 K to 240 K. DC and AC magnetization measurements reveal magnetic phase diagrams consistent with the formation of a skyrmion pocket just below $T_C$. The magnitudes of ferromagnetic and DM exchanges are determined from the phase diagrams, demonstrating that the introduction of increasing amounts of Pt can be used to increase spin-orbit coupling in order to control the expected skyrmion lattice parameter between 140 nm and 65 nm while simultaneously increasing $T_C$."

We start from a maximally O($M$)-symmetric multicomponent scalar model, Its symmetry is partially gauged to obtain an SU($N_c$) gauge theory (scalar chromodynamics) with global U$(N_f)$ (for $N_c\ge 3$) or Sp($N_f$) symmetry (for $N_c=2$), where $N_f>1$ is the number of flavors. Correspondingly, the fields belong to the coset $S^M$/SU($N_c$) where $S^M$ is the $M$-dimensional sphere and $M=2 N_f N_c$. In agreement with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, the system is always disordered at finite temperature and a critical behavior only develops in the zero-temperature limit. Its universal features are investigated by numerical finite-size scaling methods. The results show that the asymptotic low-temperature behavior belongs to the universality class of the 2D CP$^{N_f-1}$ field theory for $N_c>2$, and to that of the 2D Sp($N_f$) field theory for $N_c=2$. These universality classes correspond to 2D statistical field theories associated with symmetric spaces that are invariant under Sp($N_f$) transformations for $N_c=2$ and under SU($N_f$) for $N_c > 2$. These symmetry groups are the same invariance groups of scalar chromodynamics, apart from a U(1) flavor symmetry that is present for $N_f \ge N_c > 2$, which does not play any role in determining the asymptotic behavior of the model."

A clear description of the atomistic mechanisms ruling the graphene expansion process at the stepped regions of the substrate is provided, showing that different routes can be followed, depending on the height of the steps to be crossed. When a growing graphene flake reaches a monoatomic step, it extends jointly with the underlying Ni layer; for higher Ni edges, a different process, involving step retraction and graphene landing, becomes active. At step bunches, the latter mechanism leads to a peculiar 'staircase formation' behavior, where terraces of equal width form under the overgrowing graphene, driven by a balance in the energy cost between C-Ni bond formation and stress accumulation in the carbon layer. Our results represent a step towards bridging the material gap in searching new strategies and methods for the optimization of chemical vapor deposition graphene production on polycrystalline metal surfaces."

We investigate the importance of two factors, semantic sparsity and frequency growth rates of semantic neighbors, formalized in the distributional semantics paradigm. We show that both factors are predictive of word emergence although we find more support for the latter hypothesis.

However, unique driving styles, inconsistent behavior, and complex decision processes render it a challenging task, and existing approaches often lack variability or robustness. To approach this problem, we propose Probabilistic Modeling of Driver behavior (ProMoD), a modular framework which splits the task of driver behavior modeling into multiple modules. A global target trajectory distribution is learned with Probabilistic Movement Primitives, clothoids are utilized for local path generation, and the corresponding choice of actions is performed by a neural network. Experiments in a simulated car racing setting show considerable advantages in imitation accuracy and robustness compared to other imitation learning algorithms. The modular architecture of the proposed framework facilitates straightforward extensibility in driving line adaptation and sequencing of multiple movement primitives for future research."

In a previous paper, we have shown that the collapse of dark energy fields leads to the formation of Super Massive Black Holes with masses comparable to the masses of Black Holes at the centers of galaxies. Thus it becomes a pressing issue to investigate the other physical consequences of the collapse of Dark Energy fields. Given that the primary interactions of Dark Energy fields with the rest of the Universe are gravitational, it is particularly interesting to investigate the gravitational wave signals emitted during the process of the collapse of Dark Energy fields. This is the focus of the current work described in this paper. We describe and use the 3+1 BSSN formalism to follow the evolution of the dark energy fields coupled with gravity and to extract the gravitational wave signals. Finally, we describe the results of our numerical computations and the gravitational wave signals produced as a result of the collapse of the dark energy fields."

We compare the case of buildings with a squared section with a configuration with slender buildings both in the case of unit canyon width to height aspect ratio and in the case of AR = 2. The former corresponds to skimming flow and the latter to wake-interference regime. Measurements are performed in a water channel, measuring velocity on a vertical mid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean flow, its second-order turbulence statistics, the exchange fluxes, and the integral time scales investigated, with results showing that slender buildings enhance turbulence production and yield longer integral time scales in the region just above the building roof. The combined analysis of the turbulence production fields and the snapshots of the flow during sweep and ejection events demonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon and the external flow is significantly more unstable with slender buildings, mainly because the damping effect of the vertical velocity fluctuations from the flat roof of the upwind building is substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream) portion of the interface is prone to the direct interaction of the external flow structures. The higher turbulence intensity promotes the ventilation at the canyon interface. In summary, the present experiments show that the effect of the reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant when the urban canopy consists of narrow canyons. The result is of interest since narrow street canyons are typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture of the old European city centres."

The linear frequency dependence of the optical conductivity provides clear evidence for metallization of trigonal tellurium (Te-I) and the linear band dispersion above 3.0 GPa. This semimetallic Weyl phase can be tuned by increasing pressure further: a kink separates two linear regimes in the optical conductivity (at 3.7 GPa), a signature proposed for Type-II Weyl semimetals with tilted cones; this however reveals a different origin in trigonal tellurium. Our density-functional calculations do not reveal any significant tilting and suggest that Te-I remains in the Type-I Weyl phase, but with two valence bandsin the vicinity of the Fermi level. Their interplay giving rise to the peculiar optical conductivity behavior with more than one linear regime. Pressure above 4.3 GPa stabilizes the more complex Te-II and Te-III polymorphs, which are robust metals."

Here, we report the investigation of the interlayer coupling of the epitaxially grown single-crystal 30{\deg} twisted BLG on Cu(111) at the atomic scale. The stacking order and morphology of BLG is controlled by a rationally designed two-step growth process, that is, the thermodynamically controlled nucleation and kinetically controlled growth. The crystal structure of the 30{\deg}-twisted bilayer graphene (30{\deg}-tBLG) is determined to have the quasicrystal like symmetry. The electronic properties and interlayer coupling of the 30{\deg}-tBLG is investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The energy-dependent local density of states (DOS) with in-situ electrostatic doping shows that the electronic states in two graphene layers are decoupled near the Dirac point. A linear dispersion originated from the constituent graphene monolayers is discovered with doubled degeneracy. This study contributes to controlled growth of twist-angle-defined BLG, and provides insights of the electronic properties and interlayer coupling in this intriguing system."

This drawback is particularly severe when the properties of the system critically depend on the twist angle, as in the case of the dodecagonal quasicrystal formed by two graphene layers rotated by 30{\deg}. Here we show that large-area 30{\deg}-rotated bilayer graphene can be grown deterministically by chemical vapor deposition on Cu, eliminating the need of artificial assembly. The quasicrystals are easily transferred to arbitrary substrates and integrated in high-quality hBN-encapsulated heterostructures, which we process into dual-gated devices exhibiting carrier mobility up to 10^5 cm^2/Vs. From low-temperature magnetotransport, we find that the graphene quasicrystals effectively behave as uncoupled graphene layers, showing 8-fold degenerate quantum Hall states: this result indicates that the Dirac cones replica detected by previous photo-emission experiments do not contribute to the electrical transport."

The birefringence power spectrum, measured using a curved-sky quadratic estimator, is consistent with zero. Our results provide the tightest current constraint on birefringence over a range of angular scales between $5$ arcminutes and $9$ degrees. We improve previous upper limits on the amplitude of a scale-invariant birefringence power spectrum by a factor of between $2$ and $3$. Assuming a nearly-massless axion field during inflation, our result is equivalent to a $2\,\sigma$ upper limit on the Chern-Simons coupling constant between axions and photons of $g_{\alpha\gamma}<4.0\times 10^{-2}/H_I$ where $H_I$ is the inflationary Hubble scale."

Although experimental data on thousands of binary mixtures are available, prediction methods are needed to calculate the activity coefficients in many relevant mixtures that have not been explored to-date. In this report, we propose a probabilistic matrix factorization model for predicting the activity coefficients in arbitrary binary mixtures. Although no physical descriptors for the considered components were used, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method that has been refined over three decades while requiring much less training effort. This opens perspectives to novel methods for predicting physico-chemical properties of binary mixtures with the potential to revolutionize modeling and simulation in chemical engineering."

These surveys found a power-law relation between $M_{\rm{dust}}$ and $M_{\star}$ that steepens in time, but which is also flatter for transition disks (TDs). We performed dust evolution models, which included perturbations to the gas surface density with different amplitudes to investigate the effect of particle trapping on the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation. These perturbations were aimed at mimicking pressure bumps that originated from planets. We focused on the effect caused by different stellar and disk masses based on exoplanet statistics that demonstrate a dependence of planet mass on stellar mass and metallicity. Models of dust evolution can reproduce the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation in different star-forming regions when strong pressure bumps are included and when the disk mass scales with stellar mass (case of $M_{\rm{disk}}=0.05\,M_\star$ in our models). This result arises from dust trapping and dust growth beyond centimeter-sized grains inside pressure bumps. However, the flatter relation of $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ for TDs and disks with substructures cannot be reproduced by the models unless the formation of boulders is inhibited inside pressure bumps. In the context of pressure bumps originating from planets, our results agree with current exoplanet statistics on giant planet occurrence increasing with stellar mass, but we cannot draw a conclusion about the type of planets needed in the case of low-mass stars. This is attributed to the fact that for $M_\star<1\,M_\odot$, the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}$ obtained from models is very low due to the efficient growth of dust particles beyond centimeter-sizes inside pressure bumps."

Within the range of our search, we find 8 previously undetected candidates with the remaining 66 candidates overlapping 51% of the Kruse et al. study that manually vet Campaign 5 candidates. In order to vet our potential transit signals, we introduce the Exoplanet Detection Identification Vetter (EDI-Vetter), which is a fully automated program able to determine if a transit signal should be labeled as a false positive or a planet candidate. This automation allows us to create a statistically uniform catalog, ideal for planet occurrence rate measurements. When tested, the vetting software is able to ensure our sample is 94.2% reliable against systematic false positives. Additionally, we inject artificial transits at the light-curve-level of the raw K2 data and find the maximum completeness of our pipeline is 70% before vetting and 60% after vetting.

This required deploying a novel statistical approach to permit investigation of neural activity at the scale of individual trials. Here we present tests using synthetic data to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this analysis. We fabricated datasets to match each of several potential response patterns derived from single-stimulus response distributions. In particular, we simulated dual stimulus trial spike counts that reflected fluctuating mixtures of the single stimulus spike counts, stable intermediate averages, single stimulus winner-take-all, or response distributions that were outside the range defined by the single stimulus responses (such as summation or suppression). We then assessed how well the analysis recovered the correct response pattern as a function of the number of simulated trials and the difference between the simulated responses to each ""stimulus"" alone. We found excellent recovery of the mixture, intermediate, and outside categories (>97% percent correct), and good recovery of the single/winner-take-all category (>90% correct) when the number of trials was >20 and the single-stimulus response rates were 50Hz and 20Hz respectively. Both larger numbers of trials and greater separation between the single stimulus firing rates improved categorization accuracy. These results provide a benchmark, and guidelines for data collection, for use of this method to investigate coding of multiple items at the individual-trial time scale."

Three-wave interactions between these modes can explain the occurrence of spatially complex steady patterns and time-varying states including spatiotemporal chaos. The interactions can take the form of two short waves with different orientations interacting with one long wave, or vice-versa. We investigate the role of such three-wave interactions in a coupled Brusselator system. As well as finding simple steady patterns when the waves reinforce each other, we can also find spatially complex but steady patterns, including quasipatterns. When the waves compete with each other, time varying states such as spatiotemporal chaos are also possible. The signs of the quadratic coefficients in three-wave interaction equations distinguish between these two cases. By manipulating parameters of the chemical model, the formation of these various states can be encouraged, as we confirm through extensive numerical simulation. Our arguments allow us to predict when spatiotemporal chaos might be found: standard nonlinear methods fail in this case. The arguments are quite general and apply to a wide class of pattern-forming systems, including the Faraday wave experiment."

Sensitivity analysis in which secondary tasks were re-defined by grouping similar tasks was performed to investigate the extent to which ORs are affected by the specific task definitions in SHRP2. A novel visual representation of multitasking was developed to show which secondary tasks co-occur frequently and which ones do not. MAD occurs in 11% of control driving segments, 22% of crashes and near-crashes (CNC), 26% of Level 1-3 crashes and 39% of rear-end striking crashes, and 9%, 16%, 17% and 28% respectively for the same event types if MAD is defined in terms of general task groups. The most common co-occurrences of secondary tasks vary substantially among event types; for example, 'Passenger in adjacent seat - interaction' and 'Other non-specific internal eye glance' tend to co-occur in CNC but tend not to co-occur in control driving segments. The odds ratios of MAD compared to driving without any secondary task and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals are 2.38 (2.17-2.61) for CNC, 3.72 (3.11-4.45) for Level 1-3 crashes and 8.48 (5.11-14.07) for rear-end striking crashes. The corresponding ORs using general task groups to define MAD are slightly lower at 2.00 (1.80-2.21) for CNC, 3.03 (2.48-3.69) for Level 1-3 crashes and 6.94 (4.04-11.94) for rear-end striking crashes. The results confirm that independently of whether secondary tasks are defined according to SHRP2 or general task groups, the reduction of driving performance from MAD observed in simulator studies is manifested in real-world crashes as well."

In this work, we want to further understand the bubble nucleation and growth mechanism. In particular, we quantitatively study the effect of the amount of dissolved air on the bubble nucleation and growth dynamics, both for the initial giant bubble, which forms shortly after switching on the laser and is mainly composed of vapor, and for the final life phase of the bubble, during which it mainly contains air expelled from water. We found that the bubble nucleation temperature depends on the gas concentration: the higher the gas concentration, the lower the bubble nucleation temperature. Also, the long-term diffusiondominated bubble growth is governed by the gas concentration. The radius of the bubbles grows as R(t)~t^1/3 for airequilibrated and air-oversaturated water. In contrast, in partially degassed water, the growth is much slower since, even for the highest temperature we achieve, the water remains undersaturated."

This work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon detonation in the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar model. In order to simulate the influence of core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started. Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS. An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received little attention before. In this ""scissors mechanism"", the impact the helium detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for multi-dimensional simulations."

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements have been performed in conjunction with electrical characterization and current transient analyses. The correlation between yellow luminescence (YL), C- and Ga vacancy concentration is investigated. Time-resolved PL indicating the C$_{\mathrm{N}}$O$_{\mathrm{N}}$ complex as the main source of the YL, while Ga vacancies or related complexes with C seem not to play a major role. The device dynamic performance is found to be significantly dependent on the C concentration close to the channel of the transistor. Additionally, the magnitude of the YL is found to be in agreement with the threshold voltage shift and with the on-resistance degradation. Trap analysis of the GaN buffer shows an apparent activation energy of $\sim$0.8eV for all samples, pointing to a common dominating trapping process and that the growth parameters affect solely the density of trap centres. It is inferred that the trapping process is likely to be directly related to C based defects."

Recent measurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 led to an estimate of the masses of the planets, enabling an estimate of their densities. A recent TTV analysis using data obtained in the past two years yields a 34% and 13% increase in mass for TRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body model is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general relativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, we show that in the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might be also relevant to correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In particular, using standard values of the tidal Love number $k_2$ (accounting for the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number $k_{2f}$ (accounting for the rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and c similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that relaxing the values of tidal Love number $k_2$ and the fluid Love number $k_{2f}$ can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10~s on a $3-4$-year timescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love numbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for planets with a liquid ocean, which, if detected, might then be interpreted as a sign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For TRAPPIST-1 and similar systems, the models to fit the TTVs should potentially account for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for the rotational deformation of the planets and, to a lesser extent, for the rotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7x2+1 = 15 additional free parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1."

We investigate the possibility for a protostellar disk to be formed from a motionless dense core which contains non-axisymmetric density fluctuations. The rotation is thus generated locally by the asymmetry of the collapse. We study the evolution of the angular momentum in a non-axisymmetric collapse of a dense core from an analytical point of view. To test the theory, we perform three-dimensional simulations of a collapsing prestellar dense core using adaptative mesh refinement. We start from a non-axisymmetrical situation, considering a dense core with random density perturbations that follow a turbulence spectrum. We analyse the emerging disk comparing the angular momentum it contains with the one expected from our analytic development. We study the velocity gradients at different scales in the simulation as it is done with observations. We show that the angular momentum in the frame of a stellar object which is not located at the center of mass of the core is not conserved, due to inertial forces. Our simulations of such non-axisymmetrical collapse quickly produce accretion disks at the small scales in the core. The analysis of the kinematics at different scales in the simulated core reveals projected velocity gradients of amplitudes similar to the ones observed in protostellar cores, and which directions vary, sometimes even reversing when small and large scales are compared. These complex kinematics patterns appear in recent observations, and could be a discriminating feature with models where rotation is inherited from large scales. Our results from simulations without initial rotation are more consistent with these recent observations than when solid-body rotation is initially [abridged]"

During the last several years, a number of studies have revealed that nucleation in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical, where the formation of crystalline phases involves several steps. Based on these recent insights we have formulated a tentative general model for calcium sulfate precipitation from solution. This model involves primary species that are formed through the assembly of multiple Ca2+ and SO42- ions into nanoclusters. These nanoclusters assemble into poorly ordered (i.e. amorphous) hydrated aggregates, which in turn undergo ordering into coherent crystalline units. The thermodynamic (meta)stability of any of the three CaSO4 phases is regulated by temperature, pressure and ionic strength with gypsum being the stable form at low temperatures and low to medium ionic strengths, and anhydrite the stable phase at high temperatures and lower temperature at high salinities. Bassanite is metastable across the entire phase diagram but readily forms as the primary phase at high ionic strengths across a wide range of temperatures, and can persist up to several months. Although the physicochemical conditions leading to bassanite formation in aqueous systems are relatively well established, nanoscale insights into the nucleation mechanisms and pathways are still lacking. To fill this gap, and to further improve our general model for calcium sulfate precipitation, we have conducted in situ scattering measurements at small- and wide-angles (SAXS/WAXS) and complemented these with in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. Based on these experiments we show that the process of formation of bassanite from aqueous solutions is very similar to the formation of gypsum: it involves the aggregation of small primary species into larger disordered aggregates."

The faint-end of the H$Î±$ luminosity function   at z $\sim$ 0.40,"We take advantage of the capability of the OTELO survey to obtain the H$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) at ${\rm z}\sim0.40$. Because of the deepest coverage of OTELO, we are able to determine the faint end of the LF, and thus better constrain the star formation rate and the number of galaxies at low luminosities. The AGN contribution to this LF is estimated as well. We make use of the multi-wavelength catalogue of objects in the field compiled by the OTELO survey, which is unique in terms of minimum flux and equivalent width. We also take advantage of the pseudo-spectra built for each source, which allow the identification of emission lines and the discrimination of different types of objects. The H$\alpha$ luminosity function at $z\sim0.40$ is obtained, which extends the current faint end by almost 1 dex, reaching minimal luminosities of $\log_{10}L_{\rm lim}=38.5$ erg s$^{-1}$ (or $\sim0.002\, \text{M}_\odot\text{ yr}^{-1})$. The AGN contribution to the total H$\alpha$ luminosity is estimated. We find that no AGN should be expected below a luminosity of $\log_{10}L=38.6$ erg s$^{-1}$. From the sample of non-AGN (presumably, pure SFG) at $z\sim0.40$ we estimated a star formation rate density of $\rho_{\rm SFR}=0.012\pm0.005\ {\rm \text{M}_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}\ Mpc^{-3}}$."

When a supercomputing application initiates the transfer of a message using a high-level communication routine such as an MPI_Send, the payload of the message traverses multiple software stacks, the I/O subsystem on both the host and target nodes, and network components such as the switch. In this paper, we analyze where, why, and how much time is spent on the critical path of communication by modeling the overall injection overhead and end-to-end latency of a system. We focus our analysis on the performance of small messages since fine-grained communication is becoming increasingly important with the growing trend of an increasing number of cores per node. The analytical models present an accurate and detailed breakdown of time spent in internode communication. We validate the models on Arm ThunderX2-based servers connected with Mellanox InfiniBand. This is the first work of this kind on Arm. Alongside our breakdown, we describe the methodology to measure the time spent in each component so that readers with access to precise CPU timers and a PCIe analyzer can measure breakdowns on systems of their interest. Such a breakdown is crucial for software developers, system architects, and researchers to guide their optimization efforts. As researchers ourselves, we use the breakdown to simulate the impacts and discuss the likelihoods of a set of optimizations that target the bottlenecks in today's high-performance communication."

Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593 (2019)]. Here, we study the differences between effective potentials from fully numerical density functional and optimized effective potential calculations for fixed configurations. We find that the differences are small, overall, and choose exchange-only potentials at the local density approximation level of theory computed on top of Hartree-Fock densities as a good compromise. The differences between potentials arising from different atomic configurations are also found to be small at this level of theory.   Furthermore, we discuss the efficient Gaussian-basis implementation of SAP via error function fits to fully numerical atomic radial potentials. The guess obtained from the fitted potentials can be easily implemented in any Gaussian-basis quantum chemistry code in terms of two-electron integrals. Fits covering the whole periodic table from H to Og are reported for non-relativistic as well as fully relativistic four-component calculations that have been carried out with fully numerical approaches."

Optical meteor observations were used to derive the population and mass indices, flux, and radiant positions of Draconid meteors. Methods. 90 minutes of multi-station observations after the predicted peak of activity were performed using highly sensitive Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) cameras. The data calibration is discussed in detail. A novel maximum likelihood estimation method of computing the population and mass index with robust error estimation was developed. We apply the method to observed Draconids and use the values to derive the flux. Meteor trajectories are computed and compared to predicted radiant positions from meteoroid ejection models. Results. We found that the mass index was $1.74 \pm 0.18$ in the 30 minute bin after the predicted peak, and $2.32 \pm 0.27$ in the next 60 minutes.

However, channel estimation (CE) is a big challenge in FBMC because it suffers from intrinsic interference which is due to the orthogonality of the subcarrier functions in the real field only. In this paper, we investigate a proposed modified interference approximation scheme (M-IAM) by approximating the intrinsic interference from the neighboring pilots to accommodate the complex channel frequency and thus improving CE performance besides simplifying its processing. The M-IAM scheme has larger pseudo pilot magnitude than other conventional preamble schemes, namely the interference approximation method (IAM) with its versions (IAM-C) and (E-IAM-C); in addition to the novel preamble design (NPS). In addition, the proposed (M-IAM) scheme is characterized by the lower transmitted power needed. The CE performance of the M-IAM is investigated through 512 and 2048 subcarriers via different types of outdoor and indoor multipath fading channels that are time-invariant such as IEEE 802.22, IEEE 802.11, Rician, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), as well as time varying channels such as Rayleigh and Vehicular A (Veh-A). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed M-IAM scheme achieves a lower bit error rate (BER), lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) and lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) over the conventional preamble schemes under the aforementioned channel models. The proposed scheme has the advantage of saving the transmitted power, a requirement that could match 5G low power requirements."

In contrast to previous database-driven materials categorization our approach allows us to identify candidates that are alloys, solid-solutions, or compounds with statistical vacancies. While previous material searches relied on density functional theory, our approach is not limited by this method and could also be used to discover magnetic and statistically-disordered topological semimetals."

Be stars are physically complex systems that continue to challenge theory to understand their rapid rotation, complex variability and decretion disks. $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae ($\gamma$ Cas) is one such star but is even more curious because of its unexplained hard thermal X-ray emission. Aims. We aim to examine the optical variability of $\gamma$ Cas and thereby to shed more light on its puzzling behaviour. Methods. Three hundred twenty-one archival H$\alpha$ spectra from 2006 to 2017 are analysed to search for frequencies corresponding to the 203.5 day orbit of the companion. Space photometry from the SMEI satellite from 2003 to 2011 and the BRITE-Constellation of nano-satellites between 2015 and 2019 is investigated in the period range from a couple of hours to a few days. Results. The orbital period of the companion of 203.5 days is confirmed with independent measurements from the structure of the H$\alpha$ line emission. A strong blue/red asymmetry in the amplitude distribution across the H$\alpha$ emission line could hint at a spiral structure in the decretion disk. With the space photometry, the known frequency of 0.82 d$^{-1}$ is confirmed in data from the early 2000s. A higher frequency of 2.48 d$^{-1}$ is present in the data from 2015 to 2019 and possibly also in the early 2000s. A third frequency at 1.25 d$^{-1}$ is proposed to exist in both SMEI and BRITE data. The only explanation covering all three rapid variations seems to be nonradial pulsation. The two higher frequencies are incompatible with rotation."

However, this smoothing technique requires an observer (Alice, say) to know the nature of the measurement records that are unknown to her in order to characterize the possible true states for Bob's (say) systems. If Alice makes an incorrect assumption about the set of true states for Bob's system, she will obtain a smoothed state that is suboptimal, and, worse, may be unrealizable (not corresponding to a valid evolution for the true states) or even unphysical (not represented by a state matrix $\rho\geq0$). In this paper, we review the historical background to quantum state smoothing, and list general criteria a smoothed quantum state should satisfy. Then we derive, for the case of linear Gaussian quantum systems, a necessary and sufficient constraint for realizability on the covariance matrix of the true state. Naturally, a realizable covariance of the true state guarantees a smoothed state which is physical. It might be thought that any putative true covariance which gives a physical smoothed state would be a realizable true covariance, but we show explicitly that this is not so. This underlines the importance of the realizabilty constraint."

However, any experimental proof of such robustness is still lacking. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the topological properties of the ferromagnetic kagome compound Co3Sn2S2 are preserved upon Ni substitution. We systematically vary the Ni content in Co3Sn2S2 single crystals and study their magnetic and anomalous transport properties. For the intermediate Ni substitution, we observe a remarkable increase in the coercive field while still maintaining significant anomalous Hall conductivity. The large anomalous Hall conductivity of these compounds is intrinsic, consistent with first-principle calculations, which proves its topological origin. Our results can guide further studies on the chemical tuning of topological materials for better understanding."

An alternative is to prevent new customers from installing solar PV systems, but this is against the common goal of increasing renewable energy generation. This paper demonstrates that solar PV curtailment in low voltage areas can be reduced and fairly distributed among PV owners by centrally coordinating the operation of PV inverters. The optimal inverter active and reactive power operation points are computed by solving a multi-objective optimization problem with a fairness objective. The main results show that fair optimal inverter dispatch (FOID) results in less power curtailment than passive voltage regulation based on Volt/VAr droop control, especially at high solar PV to load ratios. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated on a residential low voltage network."

The IoT data allows creating profitable services using machine learning. However, previous research does not address the problem of optimal pricing and bundling of machine learning-based IoT services. In this paper, we define the data value and service quality from a machine learning perspective. We present an IoT market model which consists of data vendors selling data to service providers, and service providers offering IoT services to customers. Then, we introduce optimal pricing schemes for the standalone and bundled selling of IoT services. In standalone service sales, the service provider optimizes the size of bought data and service subscription fee to maximize its profit. For service bundles, the subscription fee and data sizes of the grouped IoT services are optimized to maximize the total profit of cooperative service providers. We show that bundling IoT services maximizes the profit of service providers compared to the standalone selling. For profit sharing of bundled services, we apply the concepts of core and Shapley solutions from cooperative game theory as efficient and fair allocations of payoffs among the cooperative service providers in the bundling coalition."

The demand for low-cost and highly secure cryptographic algorithms is increasingly growing in fields such as mobile telecommunications, handheld devices, etc. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the development of cheap and relatively fast hardware implementations of the KATAN family of block ciphers. KATAN is a family of six hardware oriented block ciphers. All KATAN ciphers share an 80-bit key and have 32, 48, or 64-bit blocks. We use VHDL under Altera Quartus in conjunction with ModelSim to implement and analyze our hardware designs. The developed designs are mapped onto high-performance Field Programmable Gate Arrays. We compare our findings with similar hardware implementations and C software versions of the algorithms. The performance analysis of the C implementations is done using Intel Vtune Amplifier running on Dell precision T7500 with its dual quad-core Xeon processor and 24 GB of RAM.

More than 3000 of them are blazars. About 60 per cent of the Fermi-LAT blazars are classified as BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), while the rest remain of uncertain type. The goal of this study was to classify those blazars of uncertain type, using a supervised machine learning method based on an artificial neural network, by comparing their properties to those of known gamma-ray sources. Probabilities for each of 1329 uncertain blazars to be a BL Lac or FSRQ are obtained. Using 90 per cent precision metric, 801 can be classified as BL Lacs and 406 as FSRQs while 122 still remain unclassified. This approach is of interest because it gives a fast preliminary classification of uncertain blazars. We also explored how different selections of training and testing samples affect the classification and discuss the meaning of network outputs."

The basic idea in the simplest case is that the transient non-equilibrium behavior is mainly governed by the component of the time-evolved system state parallel to the initial state, while the orthogonal component appears as equilibrated right from the beginning. The main emphasis is laid on the largely unexplored and particularly challenging case that one energy level exhibits a much larger population than all the others. Important examples are gapped many-body systems at low energies, for instance due to a quantum quench. A general analytical prediction is derived and is found to compare very well with various numerically exact results."

From the electromagnetic observations, summarized in \cite{Lattimer01}, and the recent observation of gravitational waves from binary neutron star inspiral GW170817 \cite{Abbott2017_etal} and GW190425 \cite{Abbott2019}, it is possible to make an estimation of the range of masses and so constraint the mass of the neutron and quark stars, determining not only the best approximation for the EoS, but which kind of stars we would be observing. In this paper we explore several configurations of neutron stars assuming a simple polytropic equation of state, using a single layer model without crust. In particular, when the EoS depends on the mass rest density, $p=K \rho_{0}^{\Gamma}$, and when it depends on the energy density $p=K \rho^{\Gamma}$, considerable differences in the mass-radius relationships are found. On the other hand, we also explore quark stars models using the MIT bag EoS for different values of the vacuum energy density $B$."

Quantum-mechanical sources of randomness are attractive because of the indeterminism of individual quantum processes. Here we consider the production of random bits from polarization measurements on photons. We first present a pedagogical discussion of how the quantum randomness inherent in such measurements is connected to quantum coherence, and how it can be quantified in terms of the quantum state and an associated entropy value known as min-entropy. We then explore these concepts by performing a series of single-photon experiments that are suitable for the undergraduate laboratory. We prepare photons in different nonentangled and entangled states, and measure these states tomographically. We use the information about the quantum state to determine, in terms of the min-entropy, the minimum amount of randomness produced from a given photon state by different bit-generating measurements. This is helpful in assessing the presence of quantum randomness and in ensuring the quality and security of the random-bit source."

Based on the properties of anisotropy of eddies in magnetized turbulence, the Velocity Gradient Technique is a method synergistic to dust polarimetry that is capable of tracing plane-of-the-sky magnetic field, measuring the magnetization of interstellar media and estimating the fraction of gravitational collapsing gas in molecular clouds using spectral line observations. In this paper, we apply this technique to five low-mass star-forming molecular clouds in the Gould Belt and compare the results to the magnetic-field orientation obtained from polarized dust emission. We find the estimates of magnetic field orientations and magnetization for both methods are statistically similar. We estimate the fraction of collapsing gas in the selected clouds. By means of the Velocity Gradient Technique, we also present the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation and magnetization of the Smith cloud, for which dust polarimetry data are unavailable."

It occurs when a strong driving field is used to render an otherwise opaque material transparent. The effect is known as electromagnetically induced transparency in atomic media and optomechanically induced transparency in systems that consist of coupled optical and mechanical resonators. In this work, we introduce the concept of photothermally induced transparency (PTIT). It happens when an optical resonator exhibits non-linear behavior due to optical heating of the resonator or its mirrors. Similar to the established mechanisms for induced transparency, PTIT can suppress the coupling between an optical resonator and a traveling optical field. We further show that the dispersion of the resonator can be modified to exhibit slow or fast light. Because of the relatively slow thermal response, we observe the bandwidth of the PTIT to be $2\pi\times15.9$ Hz which theoretically suggests a group velocity of as low as $5$ m/s."

For mixtures containing species with large differences in atomic number Z, the modeling needs to consider at the same time the kinetic theory for low-Z elements combined with the theory of strongly coupled plasma for high-Z elements, as well as all the intermediate situations that can appear in multi-component systems. For such cases, we study the pair distribution functions, self-diffusions, mutual diffusion and viscosity for ternary mixtures at extreme conditions. These quantities can be produced from first principles using orbital free molecular dynamics at the computational expense of very intensive simulations to reach good statistics. Utilizing the first-principles results as reference data, we assess the merit of a global analytic model for transport coefficients, Pseudo-Ions in Jellium (PIJ), based on an iso-electronic assumption ( iso-n e ). With a multi-component hypernetted-chain integral equation, we verify the quality of the iso-n e prescription for describing the static structure of the mixtures. This semi-analytical modeling compares well with the simulation results and allows one to consider plasma mixtures not accessible to simulations. Applications are given for the mix of materials in ICF experiments. A reduction of a multicomponent mixture to an effective binary mixture is also established in the hydrodynamic limit and compared with PIJ estimations for ICF relevant mixtures."

Di-phenyl siloxane did not affect the catalytic activity of Pt when it was injected into the electrolyte. However, it blocked the oxygen reduction reaction when it was premixed with the catalyst. Proton transport was not blocked in either case. We postulate that di-phenyl siloxane induces hydrophobicity and causes local water starvation thereby blocking oxygen transport. Hence, the slow leaching of silicone seals in a fuel cell could cause silicon accumulation in the electrode, which will irreversibly degrade fuel cell performance by blocking oxygen transport to the catalyst sites."

Multiple stars have often been excluded from exoplanet searches, especially those performed using the radial velocity technique, due to the technical challenges posed by such targets. As a consequence and despite recent efforts, our knowledge of the frequency of planets in multiple stellar systems is still rather incomplete. On the other hand, the lack of knowledge about the binarity at the time of the compilation of the target samples means that our estimate of the planet frequency around single stars could be tainted by the presence of unknown binaries, especially if these objects have a different behavior in terms of planet occurrence. In a previous work we investigated the binarity of the objects included in the Uniform Detectability sample defined by Fisher and Valenti (2005), showing how more than 20% of their targets were, in fact, not single stars. Here, we present an update of this census, made possible mainly by the information now available thanks to the second Gaia Data Release. The new binary sample includes a total of 313 systems, of which 114 were added through this work. We were also able to significantly improve the estimates of masses and orbital parameters for most of the pairs in the original list, especially those at close separations. A few new systems with white dwarf companions were also identified. The results of the new analysis are in good agreement with the findings of our previous work, confirming the lack of difference in the overall planet frequency between binaries and single stars but suggesting a decrease in the planet frequency for very close pairs.}"

The behavior of velocity gradients in filaments, however, has not been studied in detail, particularly on small scales (< 0.1 pc). In this paper, we present MUFASA, an efficient, robust, and automatic method to fit ammonia lines with multiple velocity components, generalizable to other molecular species. We also present CRISPy, a Python package to identify filament spines in 3D images (e.g., position-position-velocity cubes), along with a complementary technique to sort fitted velocity components into velocity-coherent filaments. In NGC 1333, we find a wealth of velocity gradient structures on a beam-resolved scale of ~0.05 pc. Interestingly, these local velocity gradients are not randomly oriented with respect to filament spines and their perpendicular, i.e., radial, component decreases in magnitude towards the spine for many filaments. Together with remarkably constant velocity gradients on larger scales along many filaments, these results suggest a scenario in which gas falling onto filaments is progressively damped and redirected to flow along these filaments."

In this system, Ce ions form zig-zag chains that extend along the $c$-axis. We focus on the lack of the local inversion symmetry at the Ce site, although the crystal structure has an inversion center. A theoretical study has predicted that magnetization can be induced by an electric current in the AFM ordering on the zig-zag chain. We conducted magnetization measurements on Ce$_{3}$TiBi$_{5}$ under an applied constant electric current and a static magnetic field around the AFM ordering temperature of $T_{\rm N}$ = 5.0 K. We successfully observed of the current-induced magnetization below $T_{\rm N}$. The magnitude of the current-induced magnetization has a linear electric current dependence and exhibits no magnetic field dependence. This behavior is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the ME effect in the ferrotoroidal ordered state."

These scattering amplitudes are characterized by intricate cancellations between different contributions: although individual contributions may grow as fast as ${\cal O}(s^5)$, the full results grow only as ${\cal O}(s)$. We demonstrate that the cancellations persist for all incoming and outgoing particle helicities and examine how truncating the computation to only include a finite number of intermediate states impacts the accuracy of the results. We also carefully assess the range of validity of the low energy effective Kaluza-Klein theory. In particular, for the warped case we demonstrate directly how an emergent low energy scale controls the size of the scattering amplitude, as conjectured by the AdS/CFT correspondence."

In this work, using first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, we propose that the robust quantum anomalous Hall states with sizable band gaps emerge in the van der Waals heterostructure of germanene/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. This heterostructure possesses high thermodynamic stability, thus facilitating its experimental fabrication. Furthermore, we uncover that the proximity effect enhances the coupling between the germanene and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ layers, inducing the nontrivial band gaps in a wide range from 29 meV to 72 meV. The chiral edge states inside the band gap, leading to Hall conductance quantized to $-e^2/h$, are clearly visible. This findings provide an ideal candidate to detect the quantum anomalous Hall states and realize further applications to nontrivial quantum transport at a high temperature."

To demonstrate that `INDICATE' is a powerful spatial analysis tool which when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly probe star formation history.   Methods. We compared the dynamic & spatial distributions of young stellar objects (YSOs) at various evolutionary stages in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper motion data and INDICATE.   Results. The dynamic & spatial behaviours of YSOs at different evolutionary stages are distinct. Dynamically, Class II YSOs predominately have non-random trajectories that are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class III YSOs have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns. Spatially, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage and source concentration: 69.4% of Class 0/I, 27.9% of Class II, and 7.7% of Class III objects are found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered with objects of the same class also follows this trend. Class 0/I objects are both found to be more tightly clustered with the general populous/objects of the same class than Class IIs and IIIs by a factor of 1.2/4.1 and 1.9/6.6, respectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05deg of S Mon where Class III objects mimic the behaviours of Class II sources across the wider cluster region. Our results suggest (i) current YSOs distributions are a result of dynamical evolution, (ii) prolonged star formation has been occurring sequentially, and (iii) stellar feedback from S Mon is causing YSOs to appear as more evolved sources.   Conclusions. Designed to provide a quantitative measure of clustering behaviours, INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial analyses. Our findings are consistent with what is known about NGC 2264, effectively demonstrating that when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 INDICATE can be used to robustly study the star formation history of a cluster."

The linear model upon which it relies theoretically leads to the formation of observable quantities robust against residual aberrations. In practice, detection limits reported thus far seem to be dominated by systematic errors induced by calibration biases not sufficiently filtered out by the kernel projection operator. This paper focuses on the impact the initial modeling of the aperture has on these errors and introduces a strategy to mitigate them, using a more accurate aperture transmission model. The paper first uses idealized monochromatic simulations of a non trivial aperture to illustrate the impact modeling choices have on calibration errors. It then applies the outlined prescription to two distinct data-sets of images whose analysis has previously been published. The use of a transmission model to describe the aperture results in a significant improvement over the previous type of analysis. The thus reprocessed data-sets generally lead to more accurate results, less affected by systematic errors. As kernel-phase observing programs are becoming more ambitious, accuracy in the aperture description is becoming paramount to avoid situations where contrast detection limits are dominated by systematic errors. Prescriptions outlined in this paper will benefit any attempt at exploiting kernel-phase for high-contrast detection."

Here we present the results from three systems that had high probabilities of transiting planets: HD 9446 b & c, HD 43691 b, & HD 179079 b. We provide new radial velocity (RV) measurements that are then used to improve the orbital solution for the known planets. We search the RV data for indications of additional planets in orbit and find that HD 9446 shows a strong linear trend of 4.8$\sigma$. Using the newly refined planet orbital solutions, which include a new best-fit solution for the orbital period of HD 9446 c, and an improved transit ephemerides, we found no evidence of transiting planets in the photometry for each system. Transits of HD 9446 b can be ruled out completely and transits HD 9446 c & HD 43691 b can be ruled out for impact parameters up to b = 0.5778 and b = 0.898 respectively due to gaps in the photometry. A transit of HD 179079 b cannot be ruled out however due to the relatively small size of this planet compared to the large star and thus low signal to noise. We determine properties of the three host stars through spectroscopic analysis and find through photometric analysis that HD 9446 exhibits periodic variability."

This synthesizer is composed of pump pulses from a 10-Hz-repetition-rate Ti:sapphire pump laser and signal and idler pulses from an infrared two-stage optical parametric amplifier driven by this pump laser. With the full active stabilization of all relative time delays, relative phases, and the carrier-envelope phase, a shot-to-shot stable intense continuum harmonic spectrum is obtained around 60 eV with pulse energy above 0.24 $\mu$J. The peak power of the soft-x-ray continuum is evaluated to be beyond 1 GW with a 140 as transform limit duration. Furthermore, we found a characteristic delay dependence of the multi-cycle waveform synthesizer and established its control scheme. Compared with the one-color case, we experimentally observe an enhancement of the cut-off spectrum intensity by one to two orders of magnitude through the three-color waveform synthesis."

This concept was studied so far only for the case in which the pump wave is much stronger than the two other waves, hence can be assumed to be constant. Here we extend this analysis for the fully nonlinear process, in which all three waves can be depleted and we show that the sign and magnitude of the AGP can be controlled by the period, phase and duty cycle of the nonlinear modulation pattern. In this fully nonlinear interaction, all the states of the system can be mapped onto a closed surface. Specifically, we study a process in which the eigenstate of the system follows a circular rotation on the surface. Our analysis reveals that the AGP equals to the difference between the total phase accumulated along the circular trajectory and that along its vertical projection, which is universal for the undepleted (linear) and depleted (nonlinear) cases. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the AGPs in the processes of sum-frequency generation and difference-frequency generation have opposite chirality. Finally, we utilize the AGP in the fully nonlinear case for splitting the beam into different diffraction orders in the far field."

A Meta-Analysis of   25 Years of IUI","This reflection paper takes the 25th IUI conference milestone as an opportunity to analyse in detail the understanding of intelligence in the community: Despite the focus on intelligent UIs, it has remained elusive what exactly renders an interactive system or user interface ""intelligent"", also in the fields of HCI and AI at large. We follow a bottom-up approach to analyse the emergent meaning of intelligence in the IUI community: In particular, we apply text analysis to extract all occurrences of ""intelligent"" in all IUI proceedings. We manually review these with regard to three main questions: 1) What is deemed intelligent? 2) How (else) is it characterised? and 3) What capabilities are attributed to an intelligent entity? We discuss the community's emerging implicit perspective on characteristics of intelligence in intelligent user interfaces and conclude with ideas for stating one's own understanding of intelligence more explicitly."

To be useful for real-world applications, we believe that these near-term systems cannot simply be scaled-down non-error-corrected versions of future fault-tolerant large-scale quantum computers. These near-term systems require specific architecture and design attributes to realize their full potential. To efficiently execute an algorithm, the quantum coprocessor must be designed to scale with respect to qubit number and to maximize useful computation within the qubits' decoherence bounds. In this work, we employ an application-system-qubit co-design methodology to architect a near-term quantum coprocessor. To support algorithms from the real-world application area of simulating the quantum dynamics of a material system, we design a (parameterized) arbitrary single-qubit rotation instruction and a two-qubit entangling controlled-Z instruction. We introduce dynamic gate set and paging mechanisms to implement the instructions. To evaluate the functionality and performance of these two instructions, we implement a two-qubit version of an algorithm to study a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition and run 60 random instances of it, each of which realizes one disorder configuration and contains 40 two-qubit instructions (or gates) and 104 single-qubit instructions. We observe the expected quantum dynamics of the time-evolution of this system."

It is caused by the inactivation of the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme that causes an increase in the cellular levels of psychosine considered to be at the origin of the tissue-level effects. GALC is inactivated also in the Twitcher (TWI) mouse: a genetic model of KD that is providing important insights into the understating of the pathogenetic process and the development of possible treatments. In this article an innovative optical technique, RP-CARS, is proposed as a tool to study the degree of order of the CH2 bonds inside the myelin sheaths of TWI-mice sciatic-nerve fibres. RP-CARS, a recently developed variation of CARS microscopy, is able to combine the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS microscopy with molecular-bond-spatial-orientation sensibility. This is the first time RP-CARS is applied to the study of a genetic model of a pathology, leading to the demonstration of a post-onset progressive spatial disorganization of the myelin CH2 bonds. The presented result could be of great interest for a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the human KD and, moreover, it is an additional proof of the experimental validity of this microscopy technique."

If $\Bbbk$ is a field, and $I$ is a \emph{binomial ideal} in $\Bbbk[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ (that is, an ideal generated by polynomials with at most two terms), then $I$ induces a congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ by declaring $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ to be equivalent if there is a linear combination with nonzero coefficients of $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{u}}$ and $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{v}}$ that belongs to $I$. While every congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ arises this way, this is not a one-to-one correspondence, as many binomial ideals may induce the same congruence. Nevertheless, the link between a binomial ideal and its corresponding congruence is strong, and one may think of congruences as the underlying combinatorial structures of binomial ideals. In the current literature, the theories of binomial ideals and congruences on $\mathbb{N}^n$ are developed separately. The aim of this survey paper is to provide a detailed parallel exposition, that provides algebraic intuition for the combinatorial analysis of congruences. For the elaboration of this survey paper, we followed mainly [Kahle and Miller, Algebra Number Theory 8(6):1297-1364, 2014] with an eye on [Eisenbud and Sturmfels.

One common technique used in high contrast imaging is angular differential imaging, which calibrates the point spread function and flux leakage using a rotation in the focal plane.   Our aim is to experimentally demonstrate and validate the efficacy of an angular differential kernel-phase approach, a new method for self-calibrating interferometric observables that operates similarly to angular differential imaging, while retaining their statistical properties.   We used linear algebra to construct new observables that evolve outside of the subspace spanned by static biases. On-sky observations of a binary star with the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru telescope were used to demonstrate the practicality of this technique. We used a classical approach on the same data to compare the effectiveness of this method.   The proposed method shows smaller and more Gaussian residuals compared to classical calibration methods, while retaining compatibility with the statistical tools available. We also provide a measurement of the stability of the SCExAO instrument that is relevant to the application of the technique.   Angular differential kernel phases provide a reliable method for calibrating biased observables. Although the sensitivity at small separations is reduced for small field rotations, the calibration is effectively improved and the number of subjective choices is reduced."

It occurs in nearly any environment where hot plasma and cold gas interact: in the solar system, in comets and planetary atmospheres, and likely astrophysically, in, for example, supernova remnants and galaxy clusters. It also contributes to the soft X-ray background. Accurate spectral modeling of CX is thus critical to properly interpreting our astrophysical observations, but the commonly used CX models in popular spectral fitting packages often rely on scaling equations and may not accurately describe observations or laboratory measurements. This paper introduces a method that can be applied to high-resolution CX spectra to directly extract state-selective CX cross-sections for electron capture, a key parameter for properly simulating the resulting CX spectrum."

We investigate the formation of small scales and the dissipation of MHD wave energy through non-linear interactions of counter-propagating, phase-mixed Alfvenic waves in a complex magnetic field. Methods. We conducted fully 3-D, non-ideal MHD simulations of transverse waves in complex magnetic fields. Continuous wave drivers were imposed on the foot points of magnetic field lines and the system was evolved for several Alfven travel times. Phase-mixed waves were allowed to reflect off the upper boundary and the interactions between the resultant counter-streaming wave packets were analysed. Results. The complex nature of the background magnetic field encourages the development of phase mixing, leading to a growth in currents and vorticities. Counter-propagating phase-mixed waves induce a cascade of energy to small scales and result in more efficient energy dissipation. This effect is enhanced in simulations with more complex magnetic fields. High-frequency drivers excite localised field line resonances and produce efficient wave heating. However, this relies on the formation of large amplitude oscillations on resonant field lines. Drivers with smaller frequencies than the fundamental frequencies of field lines are not able to excite resonances and thus do not inject sufficient Poynting flux to power coronal heating. Even in the case of high-frequency oscillations, the rate of dissipation is likely too slow to balance coronal energy losses, even within the quiet Sun. Conclusions. For the generalised phase-mixing presented here, complex background field structures enhance the rate of wave energy dissipation. However, it remains difficult for realistic wave drivers to inject sufficient Poynting flux to heat the corona. Indeed, significant heating only occurs in cases which exhibit amplitudes that are much larger than those currently observed in the solar atmosphere."

We compare our analytic results obtained by using Feynman diagrams to the expressions derived in the literature by a combination of the universal one-loop effective action (UOLEA) approach and Feynman calculus.

These properties can be tuned by applying hydrostatic pressure in order to reveal and understand the physics of these materials. Not only pressure induces an insulator-to-metal transition in GaV4S8 but it also has an interesting effect on the structural and magnetic transitions. Using a combination of AC calorimetry, capacitance, and resistivity measurements under pressure, we determine the evolution of the structural and magnetic transitions with pressure and thus establish the T-P phase diagram of GaV4S8. To detect the insulator-to-metal transition, we use optical conductivity and DC resistivity measurements and we follow the evolution of the Mott gap under pressure. The structural transition temperature increases with pressure and a second transition appears above 6 GPa indicating a possible new phase with a very small gap. Pressure has surprisingly a very weak effect on the ferromagnetic transition that persists even very close to the IMT that occurs at around 14 GPa, implying that the metallic state may also be magnetic."

In two dimensions, one can similarly define ice rules for in-plane Ising-like spins arranged on a kagome lattice. These ice rules require each triangle plaquette to have a single monopole, and can lead to various unique orders and excitations. Using experimental and theoretical approaches including magnetometry, thermodynamic measurements, neutron scattering and Monte Carlo simulations, we establish HoAgGe as a crystalline (i.e. non-artificial) system that realizes the kagome spin ice state. The system features a variety of partially and fully ordered states and a sequence of field-induced phases at low temperatures, all consistent with the kagome ice rule."

This process is expected to result in the generation of unbound high energy carriers. Here, we report an unconventional photoresponse of van der Waals heterostructure devices resulting from efficient EEA. Our heterostructures, which consist of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and few-layer graphene, exhibit photocurrent when photoexcited carriers possess sufficient energy to overcome the high energy barrier of hBN. Interestingly, we find that the device exhibits moderate photocurrent quantum efficiency even when the semiconducting TMD layer is excited at its ground exciton resonance despite the high exciton binding energy and large transport barrier. Using ab initio calculations, we show that EEA yields highly energetic electrons and holes with unevenly distributed energies depending on the scattering condition. Our findings highlight the dominant role of EEA in determining the photoresponse of 2D semiconductor optoelectronic devices."

However, the quest for an optimal solution does not have a unique answer and the available data often lacks coherence. To improve this situation, modern knowledge representation techniques, that have been shaping the World Wide Web, medicine and pharmacy, should be employed. Prior efforts in the domain of space debris have only focused onto space situational awareness, neglecting ADR. To bridge this gap we present a domain-ontology of intact derelict objects, i.e. payloads and rocket bodies, for ADR capture methods selection. The ontology is defined on a minimal set of physical, dynamical and statistical parameters of a target object. The practicality and validity of the ontology are demonstrated by applying it onto a database of 30 representative objects, built by combining structured and unstructured data from publicly available sources. The analysis of results proves the ontology capable of inferring the most suited ADR capture methods for considered objects. Furthermore, it confirms its ability to handle the input data from different sources transparently, minimizing user input. The developed ontology provides an initial step towards a more comprehensive knowledge representation framework meant to improve data management and knowledge discovery in the domain of space debris. Furthermore, it provides a tool that should make the initial planning of future ADR missions simpler yet more systematic."

Optical   Properties of Emission Lines and the Global Spectrum,"We present an unbiased spectroscopic study of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Cygnus Loop using the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. LAMOST features both a large field of view and a large aperture, which allow us to simultaneously obtain 4000 spectra at $\sim$3700-9000 \AA with R$\approx$1800. The Cygnus Loop is a prototype of middle-aged SNRs, which has the advantages of being bright, large in angular size, and relatively unobscured by dust. Along the line of sight to the Cygnus Loop, 2747 LAMOST DR5 spectra are found in total, which are spatially distributed over the entire remnant. This spectral sample is free of the selection bias of most previous studies, which often focus on bright filaments or regions bright in [O III]. Visual inspection verifies that 368 spectra (13$\%$ of the total) show clear spectral features to confirm their association with the remnant. In addition, 176 spectra with line emission show ambiguity of their origin but have a possible association to the SNR. In particular, the 154 spectra dominated by the SNR emission are further analyzed by identifying emission lines and measuring their intensities. We examine distributions of physical properties such as electron density and temperature, which vary significantly inside the remnant, using theoretical models. By combining a large number of the LAMOST spectra, a global spectrum representing the Cygnus Loop is constructed, which presents characteristics of radiative shocks. Finally, we discuss the effect of the unbiased spectral sample on the global spectrum and its implication to understand a spatially unresolved SNR in a distant galaxy."

The simulation is a precise orbit determination method that does not involve ad hoc initial conditions or assumptions such as those found in planetesimal disk relaxation models upon which their conclusions depend. It can therefore be used to independently test origin theories based on relaxation models by examining the past orbits of specific real objects. Here, we examined 17 multiple-opposition high-inclination Centaurs and the two polar trans-neptunian objects 2008 KV42 and (471325) 2011 KT19. The statistical distributions show that their orbits were nearly polar 4.5 Gyr in the past, and were located in the scattered disk and inner Oort cloud regions. Early polar inclinations cannot be accounted for by current Solar system formation theory as the early planetesimal system must have been nearly flat in order to explain the low-inclination asteroid and Kuiper belts. Furthermore, the early scattered disk and inner Oort cloud regions are believed to have been devoid of Solar system material as the planetesimal disk could not have extended far beyond Neptune's current orbit in order to halt the planet's outward migration. The nearly polar orbits of high-inclination Centaurs 4.5 Gyr in the past therefore indicate their probable early capture from the interstellar medium."

While existing implementations partly meet these criteria, they suffer from certain limitations, such as rippled transmission spectra or limited dynamic range, some of which are caused by the lack of proper impedance matching. We develop a MIcrostrip Kinetic Inductance Travelling Wave Amplifier (MI-KITWA), exploiting the nonlinear kinetic inductance of tungsten-silicide for wave-mixing of the signal and a pump, and engineer the impedance to $50 \Omega$, while decreasing the phase velocity, with benefit for the amplification.

The uniaxial anisotropy universally exhibited by two-dimensional magnets has only two stable spin directions, demanding 180 degrees spin switching between states. We demonstrate a novel eightfold anisotropy in magnetic SrRuO3 monolayers by inducing a spin reorientation in (SrRuO3)1/(SrTiO3)N superlattices, in which the magnetic easy axis of Ru spins is transformed from uniaxial <001> direction (N = 1 and 2) to eightfold <111> directions (N = 3, 4 and 5). This eightfold anisotropy enables 71 and 109 degrees spin switching in SrRuO3 monolayers, analogous to 71 and 109 degrees polarization switching in ferroelectric BiFeO3. First-principle calculations reveal that increasing the SrTiO3 layer thickness induces an emergent correlation-driven orbital ordering, tuning spin-orbit interactions and reorienting the SrRuO3 monolayer easy axis. Our work demonstrates that correlation effects can be exploited to substantially change spin-orbit interactions, stabilizing unprecedented properties in two-dimensional magnets and opening rich opportunities for low-power, multi-state device applications."

Full memory encryption for Virtual Machines (VM) protects against curious cloud providers as well as otherwise compromised hypervisors. AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is the most prevalent hardware-based full memory encryption for VMs. Its newest extension, SEV-ES, also protects the entire VM state during context switches, aiming to ensure that the host neither learns anything about the data that is processed inside the VM, nor is able to modify its execution state. Several previous works have analyzed the security of SEV and have shown that, by controlling I/O, it is possible to exfiltrate data or even gain control over the VM's execution. In this work, we introduce two new methods that allow us to inject arbitrary code into SEV-ES secured virtual machines. Due to the lack of proper integrity protection, it is sufficient to reuse existing ciphertext to build a high-speed encryption oracle. As a result, our attack no longer depends on control over the I/O, which is needed by prior attacks. As I/O manipulation is highly detectable, our attacks are stealthier. In addition, we reverse-engineer the previously unknown, improved Xor-Encrypt-Xor (XEX) based encryption mode, that AMD is using on updated processors, and show, for the first time, how it can be overcome by our new attacks."

Direct manipulation of the number of photons in the light signal, such as single-photon subtraction and addition, proved to be an efficient strategy for the task. Here we propose an adaptive multi-photon subtraction scheme where a particular subtraction task is conditioned by all previous subtraction events in order to maximize the probability of successful subtraction. We theoretically illustrate this technique on the model example of conversion of Fock states via photon subtraction. We also experimentally demonstrate the core building block of the proposal by implementing a feedforward-assisted conversion of two-photon state to a single-photon state. Our experiment combines two elementary photon subtraction blocks where the splitting ratio of the second subtraction beam splitter is affected by the measurement result from the first subtraction block in real time using an ultra-fast feedforward loop. The reported optimized photon subtraction scheme applies to a broad range of photonic states, including highly nonclassical Fock states and squeezed light, advancing the photonic quantum toolbox."

Similar to the Haldane model, our 2D array is translation invariant, has zero net gauge flux threading the lattice, and exploits next-nearest neighbor couplings to achieve a topologically non-trivial bandgap. Using direct imaging and on-chip transmission measurements, we show that the bandgap hosts topologically robust edge states. We demonstrate a topological phase transition to a conventional insulator by frequency detuning the ring resonators and thereby breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice. Furthermore, the clockwise or the counter-clockwise circulation of photons in the ring resonators constitutes a pseudospin degree of freedom. We show that the two pseudospins acquire opposite hopping phases and their respective edge states propagate in opposite directions. These results are promising for the development of robust reconfigurable integrated nanophotonic devices for applications in classical and quantum information processing."

Specifically, we first designed and implemented a honeypot that could capture real attacks in the wild. We then deployed the honeypot and reported results of the collected data in a period of six months. In total, our system captured more than 308 million requests from 1,072 distinct IP addresses. We further grouped attackers into 36 groups with 59 distinct Ethereum accounts. Among them, attackers of 34 groups were stealing the Ether, while other 2 groups were targeting ERC20 tokens. The further behavior analysis showed that attackers were following a three-steps pattern to steal the Ether. Moreover, we observed an interesting type of transaction called zero gas transaction, which has been leveraged by attackers to steal ERC20 tokens.

By combining one of the first asteroseismic gravity measurements in the metal-poor regime from a TESS light curve with non-LTE analyses of iron lines, we derive a set of highly accurate and precise stellar parameters. These allow us to delineate a chemical pattern comprised of solid detections of 48 elements, including 28 neutron-capture elements, which establishes HD 20 among the few benchmark stars that have almost complete patterns with low systematic dependencies on the stellar parameters. Our light-element (Z<30) abundances are representative of other, similarly metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo with contributions from core-collapse supernovae of type II. A comparison to the scaled solar r-pattern shows that the lighter neutron-capture elements (37<Z<60) are poorly matched. In particular, we find imprints of the weak r-process acting at low metallicities. Nonetheless, by comparing our detailed abundances to the observed metal-poor star BD +17 3248, we find a persistent residual pattern that is indicative of enrichment contributions from the s-process. We show that mixing with material from predicted yields of massive, rotating AGB stars at low metallicity considerably improves the fit. Based on a solar ratio of heavy- to light-s elements -- at odds with model predictions for the i-process -- and a missing clear residual pattern with respect to other stars with claimed contributions from this process, we refute (strong) contributions from such astrophysical sites providing intermediate neutron densities. Finally, nuclear cosmochronology is used to tie our detection of the radioactive element Th to an age estimate for HD 20 of $11.0\pm3.8$ Gyr. [abridged]"

The aim of this work is to survey the key results and applications emerging from the three-parameter generalization of this function, known as the Prabhakar function. Specifically, after reviewing key historical events that led to the discovery and modern development of this peculiar function, we discuss how the latter allows one to introduce an enhanced scheme for fractional calculus. Then, we summarize the progress in the application of this new general framework to physics and renewal processes. We also provide a collection of results on the numerical evaluation of the Prabhakar function."

While previous works have addressed the challenges of dense mapping and global consistency, most require more computational resources than may be available on-board small robots. We propose a framework that creates globally consistent volumetric maps on a CPU and is lightweight enough to run on computationally constrained platforms. Our approach represents the environment as a collection of overlapping Signed Distance Function (SDF) submaps, and maintains global consistency by computing an optimal alignment of the submap collection. By exploiting the underlying SDF representation, we generate correspondence free constraints between submap pairs that are computationally efficient enough to optimize the global problem each time a new submap is added. We deploy the proposed system on a hexacopter Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) with an Intel i7-8650U CPU in two realistic scenarios: mapping a large-scale area using a 3D LiDAR, and mapping an industrial space using an RGB-D camera. In the large-scale outdoor experiments, the system optimizes a 120x80m map in less than 4s and produces absolute trajectory RMSEs of less than 1m over 400m trajectories. Our complete system, called voxgraph, is available as open source."

A new optimization framework is proposed in order to select the maximum number of SUs and compute power allocations in order to satisfy instantaneous rate or QoS requirements of SUs. The optimization framework also aims to restrict the interference to primary users (PUs) below a predefined threshold using available imperfect CSI at the SBS. In order to obtain a feasible solution for power allocation and user selection, we propose a low-complexity algorithm called DeleteSU-with-Maximum-Power-allocation (DMP). Theoretical analysis is provided to compute the interference to PUs and the number of SUs exceeding the required rate. The analysis and simulations show that the proposed DMP algorithm outperforms the stateof-the art selection algorithm in terms of serving more users with minimum rate constraints, and it approaches the optimal solution if the number of antennas is an order of magnitude greater than the number of users."

Since lambda expressions are still relatively new, not all developers use or understand them. In this paper, we first present the results of an empirical study to determine how frequently developers of GitHub repositories make use of lambda expressions and how they are documented. We find that 11% of Java GitHub repositories use lambda expressions, and that only 6% of the lambda expressions are accompanied by source code comments. We then present a tool called LambdaDoc which can automatically detect lambda expressions in a Java repository and generate natural language documentation for them. Our evaluation of LambdaDoc with 23 professional developers shows that they perceive the generated documentation to be complete, concise, and expressive, while the majority of the documentation produced by our participants without tool support was inadequate. Our contribution builds an important step towards automatically generating documentation for functional programming constructs in an object-oriented language."

Human pose is an essential cue for recognizing actions and localizing the interacted objects. Meanwhile, human action and their interacted objects' localizations provide guidance for pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a turbo learning framework to perform HOI recognition and pose estimation simultaneously. First, two modules are designed to enforce message passing between the tasks, i.e. pose aware HOI recognition module and HOI guided pose estimation module. Then, these two modules form a closed loop to utilize the complementary information iteratively, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks including Verbs in COCO (V-COCO) and HICO-DET datasets."

Their large size and relative simplicity (at least as astrophysical objects go) make them a unique laboratory to measure some of the interesting plasma properties that are inaccessible by other means but fundamentally important for understanding and modeling many astrophysical phenomena -- from solar flares to black hole accretion to galaxy formation and the emergence of the cosmological Large Scale Structure. While every cluster astrophysicist is eagerly anticipating the direct gas velocity measurements from the forthcoming microcalorimeters onboard XRISM, Athena and future missions such as Lynx, a number of those plasma properties can best be probed by high-resolution X-ray imaging of galaxy clusters. Chandra has obtained some trailblazing results, but only grazed the surface of such studies.

A circular arc formation of defenders is formed around the attacker, and vector-field based guidance laws herd the attacker to a predefined safe area in the presence of rectangular obstacles. The defenders' formation is defined based on a novel vector field that imposes super-elliptic contours around the obstacles, to closely resemble their rectangular shape. A novel finite-time stabilizing controller is proposed to guide the defenders to their desired formation while avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated via simulation results."

When twisted close to a magic relative orientation angle near 1 degree, bilayer graphene has flat moire superlattice minibands that have emerged as a rich and highly tunable source of strong correlation physics, notably the appearance of superconductivity close to interaction-induced insulating states. Here we report on the fabrication of bilayer graphene devices with exceptionally uniform twist angles. We show that the reduction in twist angle disorder reveals insulating states at all integer occupancies of the four-fold spin/valley degenerate flat conduction and valence bands, i.e. at moire band filling factors nu = 0, +(-) 1, +(-) 2, +(-) 3, and superconductivity below critical temperatures as high as 3 K close to - 2 filling. We also observe three new superconducting domes at much lower temperatures close to the nu = 0 and nu = +(-) 1 insulating states. Interestingly, at nu = +(-) 1 we find states with non-zero Chern numbers. For nu = - 1 the insulating state exhibits a sharp hysteretic resistance enhancement when a perpendicular magnetic field above 3.6 tesla is applied, consistent with a field driven phase transition. Our study shows that symmetry-broken states, interaction driven insulators, and superconducting domes are common across the entire moire flat bands, including near charge neutrality."

Phenotypic changes exhibited in cellular images are also indications of the mechanism of action (MoA) of chemical compounds. In this paper, we show how pre-trained convolutional image features can be used to assist scientists in discovering interesting chemical clusters for further investigation. Our method reduces the dimensionality of raw fluorescent stained images from a high throughput imaging (HTI) screen, producing an embedding space that groups together images with similar cellular phenotypes. Running standard unsupervised clustering on this embedding space yields a set of distinct phenotypic clusters. This allows scientists to further select and focus on interesting clusters for downstream analyses. We validate the consistency of our embedding space qualitatively with t-sne visualizations, and quantitatively by measuring embedding variance among images that are known to be similar. Results suggested the usefulness of our proposed workflow using deep learning and clustering and it can lead to robust HTI screening and compound triage."

The high aluminum coverage ($\sim$70%) of this device allows for the discrimination of surface events and separation of events occurring near the center of the detector from those near the edge.

The dimensionally reduced reconstructed action for gravity leads to a vacuum metric that includes a modified Rindler acceleration term in addition to the Schwarzschild and cosmological constant terms. The new term is free from infrared curvature singularities and leads to a much better fit of observed galaxy velocity rotation curves than the corresponding simple Rindler term of the Grumiller metric, at the expense of one additional parameter. When the new parameter is set to zero the new metric term reduces to a Rindler constant acceleration term. We use galactic velocity rotation data to find the best fit values of the parameters of the reconstructed geometric potential and discuss possible cosmological implications."

In this approach, a high-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS data by selecting not just a single precursor at a time, but by allowing a broad m/z range to be fragmented. This acquisition window is then sequentially moved from the lowest to the highest mass selection range. This technique enables the acquisition of thousands of high-resolution MS/MS spectra per minute in a standard LC-MS run. In the subsequent data analysis phase, the corresponding dataset is searched in a triple quadrupole-like mode, thus not considering the whole MS/MS scan spectrum, but by searching for several precursor to fragment transitions that identify and quantify the corresponding peptide. This search is made possible with the use of an ion library, previously acquired in a classical data dependent, full-spectrum mode. The SWATH protocol, combining the protein identification power of high-resolution MS/MS spectra with the robustness and accuracy in analyte quantification of triple-quad targeted workflows, has become very popular in proteomics research. The major drawback lies in the ion library itself, which is normally demanding and time-consuming to build. Conversely, through the realignment of chromatographic retention times, an ion library of a given proteome can relatively easily be tailored upon any proteomics experiment done on the same proteome. We are thus hereby sharing with the worldwide proteomics community our newly acquired ion library of mouse adult hippocampal neural stem cells. Given the growing effort in neuroscience research involving proteomics experiments, we believe that this data might be of great help for the neuroscience community."

Such effects can be greatly amplified in macroscopic many-body systems from virtual photon exchange between dipoles, but are often masked by inhomogeneity and pure dephasing, especially in solids. Here, we observe an exceptionally large renormalization of exciton resonance and radiative decay rate in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers due to interactions with the vacuum in both absorption and emission spectroscopy. Tuning the vacuum energy density near the monolayer, we demonstrate control of cooperative Lamb shift, radiative decay, and valley polarization as well as control of the charged exciton emission.

The reason for this historical relevance stems from the fact that, although extremely simple, the algorithm conveys all the main features of more complex quantum computations. In spite of its simplicity, the uncountable experimental realizations of the algorithm in a broad variety of physical systems are in general quite involved. The aim of this work is two-fold: to introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation for readers with just a minimum knowledge of quantum mechanics and to present a novel and entirely accessible implementation of a classical analogue of the quantum Deutsch algorithm. By employing only elementary optical devices, such as lenses and diode lasers, this experimental realization has a striking advantage over all previous implementations: it can easily be understood and reproduced in most basic undergraduate or even high-level school laboratories."

We provide an almost matching conditional lower bound, under the assumption that $(\min,+)$-convolution cannot be solved in truly subquadratic time. Furthermore, we present a new reduction (for either perimeter or area) that can make the time bound sensitive to $k$, giving near $O(n k) $ time.

We find that radio emission from super-massive black hole seeds can impact the global 21 cm signal at the level of tens to hundreds of percent provided that they were as radio loud as $z\approx1$ black holes and obscured by gas with column depths of $N_\text{H}\gtrsim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. We determine plausible sets of parameters that reproduce some of the striking features of the EDGES absorption feature including its depth, timing, and side steepness while producing radio/X-ray backgrounds and source counts that are consistent with published limits. Scenarios yielding a dramatic 21 cm signature also predict large populations of $\sim \mu$Jy point sources that will be detectable in future deep surveys from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Thus, 21 cm measurements, complemented by deep point source surveys, have the potential to constrain optimistic scenarios where super-massive black-hole progenitors were radio-loud."

Standard remedies based on mesh refinement around the singular corner result in very restrictive stability requirements on the time-step size when explicit time integration is applied. In this article, we introduce and analyse the energy-corrected finite element method for parabolic problems, which works on quasi-uniform meshes, and, based on it, create fast explicit time discretisation. We illustrate these results with extensive numerical investigations not only confirming the theoretical results but also showing the flexibility of the method, which can be applied in the presence of multiple singular corners and a three-dimensional setting. We also propose a fast explicit time-stepping scheme based on a piecewise cubic energy-corrected discretisation in space completed with mass-lumping techniques and numerically verify its efficiency."

Many timescales are involved in this process. Our hyper-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model provides a bridge between General Relativistic MHD simulations of dynamo formation, on the short accretion timescale, and observational evidence of magnetic collimation of large-scale jets on astrophysical timescales. Given the final magnetic structure, we apply hyper-resistive kinetic theory to show how instability causes slowly-evolving magnetically-collimated jets to become the most powerful relativistic accelerators in the Universe. The model yields nine observables in reasonable agreement with observations: the jet length, radiolobe radius and apparent opening angle as observed by synchrotron radiation; the synchrotron total power, synchrotron wavelengths and maximum electron energy (TeVs); and the maximum UHECR energy, the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the cosmic ray intensity on Earth."

In many situations, these hypotheses may have an underlying tree structure that not only helps determine the order that tests should be conducted but also imposes a dependency between tests that must be accounted for. Our motivating example comes from testing the association between a trait of interest and groups of microbes that have been organized into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Given p-values from association tests for each individual OTU or ASV, we would like to know if we can declare that a certain species, genus, or higher taxonomic grouping can be considered to be associated with the trait. For this problem, a bottom-up testing algorithm that starts at the lowest level of the tree (OTUs or ASVs) and proceeds upward through successively higher taxonomic groupings (species, genus, family etc.) is required. We develop such a bottom-up testing algorithm that controls the error rate of decisions made at higher levels in the tree, conditional on findings at lower levels in the tree. We further show this algorithm controls the false discovery rate based on the global null hypothesis that no taxa are associated with the trait. By simulation, we also show that our approach is better at finding driver taxa, the highest level taxa below which there are dense association signals. We illustrate our approach using data from a study of the microbiome among patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls."

We build nuclear matter, quark matter, and the mixed phases from the same NJL Lagrangian, which has been used to model free and in-medium hadrons as well as nuclear systems. A focus here is to determine if the same coupling constants in the scalar diquark and vector meson channels, which give a good description of nucleon structure and nuclear matter, can also be used for the color superconducting high density quark matter phase. We find that this is possible for the scalar diquark (pairing) interaction, but the vector meson interaction has to be reduced so that superconducting quark matter becomes the stable phase at high densities. We compare our equation of state with recent phenomenological parametrizations based on generic stability conditions for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of a neutron star, with a color superconducting quark matter core, exceeds $2.01 \pm 0.04\,M_\odot$ which is the value of the recently observed massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432.

Here a general picture of tunneling time is suggested by introducing a quantum travel time, which is defined as the ratio of the travel distance to the expected value of the velocity operator under the barrier. Specially, if applied to rectangular barrier tunneling, it can retrieve the B\""{u}ttiker-Landauer time $\tau_{BL}$ in the case of an opaque barrier, and has a clear physical meaning in the case of a very thin barrier wherein $\tau_{BL}$ can not be well defined. In the case of strong-field tunneling process, with the help of the newly defined time, the tunneling delay time measured by attoclock experiment can be interpreted as a travel time spent by the electron to tunnel from a point under the barrier to the tunnel exit. In addition, a peculiar oscillation structure in the wavelength dependence of tunneling delay time in deep tunneling regime is observed, which is beyond the scope of adiabatic tunneling picture. This oscillation structure can be attributed to the interference between the ground state tunneling channel and the excited states tunneling channels."

We present the second AGILE-GRID Catalog (2AGL) of {\gamma}-ray sources in the 100 MeV-10 GeV energy range. Methods. With respect to previous AGILE-GRID catalogs, the current 2AGL Catalog is based on the first 2.3 years of science data from the AGILE mission (the so called 'pointing mode') and incorporates more data and several analysis improvements, including better calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission, a refined procedure for point-like source detection, and the inclusion of a search for extended {\gamma}-ray sources. Results. The 2AGL Catalog includes 175 high-confidence sources (above 4{\sigma} significance) with their location regions and spectral properties, and a variability analysis with 4-day light curves for the most significant ones. Relying on the error region of each source position, including systematic uncertainties, 121 sources are considered as positionally associated with known couterparts at different wavelengths or detected by other {\gamma}-ray instruments. Among the identified or associated sources, 62 are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) of the blazar class. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class, with 40 associated pulsars, 7 of them with detected pulsation; 8 Supernova Remnants and 4 high-mass X-ray binaries have also been identified. A substantial number of 2AGL sources are unidentified: for 54 sources no known counterpart is found at different wavelengths. Among these sources, we discuss a sub-class of 29 AGILE-GRID-only {\gamma}-ray sources that are not present in 1FGL, 2FGL or 3FGL catalogs; the remaining sources are unidentified in both 2AGL and 3FGL Catalogs. We also present an extension of the analysis of 2AGL sources detected in the 50-100 MeV energy range."

A minimal Hamiltonian is constructed by considering the hybridizations of the magnetic $3d$-orbitals of Ni(Co) atoms with the $p_z$-orbitals of graphene, in addition to the atomic spin-orbit coupling and the magnetization of the Ni(Co) atoms. A low-energy effective Hamiltonian for graphene/Ni(Co) describing the perturbed $\pi$-bands in the vicinity of the Dirac points is derived which enable us to get further insight on the physical nature of the induced-effective couplings to the graphene layer. It is shown that a magneto-spin-orbit type effect may emerge through two competing mechanisms simultaneously present, namely the proximity induced exchange and Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Such effects results in giant exchange splittings and robust Rashba spin-orbit coupling transferred to the graphene layer in agreement with recent density functional theory calculations and experimental observations. We further analyze the physical conditions for the appearance of intact Dirac cones in the minority spin bands as observed by recent photoemission measurements with spin resolution."

It can be linked to good representations encoding more explanatory factors that are hidden in the original data. With the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a subclass of generative models that are able to learn representations in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion, we are now able to adversarially learn good mappings from a simple prior distribution to a target data distribution. This paper presents an overview of recent developments in GANs with a focus on learning latent space representations."

Here, we extend our recent methods by constructing points on the NHIM accurately even for multidimensional cases. We also advance the implementation of machine learning approaches to construct smooth versions of the NHIM from a known high-accuracy set of its points. That is, we expand on our earlier use of neural nets, and introduce the use of Gaussian process regression for the determination of the NHIM. Finally, we compare and contrast all of these methods for a challenging two-dimensional model barrier case so as to illustrate their accuracy and general applicability."

However, high resolution imaging of the whole brain is a technically challenging and slow process. Recently, oblique light sheet microscopy has emerged as a rapid imaging method that can provide whole brain fluorescence microscopy at a voxel size of 0.4 by 0.4 by 2.5 cubic microns. On the other hand, complex image artifacts due to whole-brain coverage produce apparent discontinuities in neuronal arbors. Here, we present connectivity-preserving methods and data augmentation strategies for supervised learning of neuroanatomy from light microscopy using neural networks. We quantify the merit of our approach by implementing an end-to-end automated tracing pipeline. Lastly, we demonstrate a scalable, distributed implementation that can reconstruct the large datasets that sub-micron whole-brain images produce."

The presentation is semi-technical in nature.Starting by noting down important contribution of Greeks, William Gilbert, Coulomb, Poisson, Oersted, Ampere, Faraday, Maxwell, and Pierre Curie, we review early 20th century investigations by Paul Langevin and Pierre Weiss. The Langevin theory of paramagnetism and the Weiss theory of ferromagnetism were partly successful and real understanding of magnetism came with the advent of quantum mechanics. Van Vleck was the pioneer in applying quantum mechanics to the problem of magnetism and we discuss his main contributions: (1) his detailed quantum statistical mechanical study of magnetism of real gases; (2) his pointing out the importance of the crystal fields or ligand fields in the magnetic behavior of iron group salts (the ligand field theory); and (3) his many contributions to the elucidation of exchange interactions in d electron metals. Next, the pioneering contributions (but lesser known) of Dorfman are discussed. Then, in chronological order, the key contributions of Pauli, Heisenberg, and Landau are presented. Finally, we discuss a modern topic of quantum spin liquids."

To recognise most gestural actions, often higher temporal precision is required for sampling visual information. Actions are defined by motion, and therefore, when using event-based cameras it is often unnecessary to re-sample the entire scene. Neuromorphic, event-based cameras have presented an alternative to visual information acquisition by asynchronously time-encoding pixel intensity changes, through temporally precise spikes (10 micro-second resolution), making them well equipped for action recognition. However, other challenges exist, which are intrinsic to event-based imagers, such as higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a spatiotemporally sparse information. One option is to convert event-data into frames, but this could result in significant temporal precision loss. In this work we introduce spatiotemporal filtering in the spike-event domain, as an alternative way of channeling spatiotemporal information through to a convolutional neural network. The filters are local spatiotemporal weight matrices, learned from the spike-event data, in an unsupervised manner. We find that appropriate spatiotemporal filtering significantly improves CNN performance beyond state-of-the-art on the event-based DVS Gesture dataset. On our newly recorded action recognition dataset, our method shows significant improvement when compared with other, standard ways of generating the spatiotemporal filters."

So far in the literature, the regularity or compactness of a superpixel shape is mainly measured by its circularity. In this work, we first demonstrate that such measure is not adapted for superpixel evaluation, since it does not directly express regularity but circular appearance. Then, we propose a new metric that considers several shape regularity aspects: convexity, balanced repartition, and contour smoothness. Finally, we demonstrate that our measure is robust to scale and noise and enables to more relevantly compare superpixel methods."

Moreover, most recent decomposition methods allow to set a shape regularity parameter, which can have a substantial impact on the measured performances. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework, that aims to unify the comparison process of superpixel methods. We investigate the limitations of existing metrics, and propose to evaluate each of the three core decomposition aspects: color homogeneity, respect of image objects and shape regularity. To measure the regularity aspect, we propose a new global regularity measure (GR), which addresses the non-robustness of state-of-the-art metrics. We evaluate recent superpixel methods with these criteria, at several superpixel scales and regularity levels. The proposed framework reduces the bias in the comparison process of state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed GR measure is correlated with the performances of various applications."

Through analytical derivations and toy model simulations, we show that $\chi^2_\mathrm{CNP}$ leads to a significantly smaller bias on the best-fit model parameters compared to those using either Neyman's or Pearson's chi-square. When the computational cost of using the Poisson-likelihood chi-square is high, $\chi^2_\mathrm{CNP}$ provides a good alternative given its natural connection to the covariance matrix formalism."

However, students are not often introduced to alternative techniques, such as variational principles, for solving circuits. Many authors have tried to derive the steady-state distribution of currents in circuits from variational principles, and the initial attempts were carried out by great physicists, such as Kirchhoff, Maxwell and Feynman. In this article, we shall review such variational principles in physics and illustrate how they can be used to solve DC circuits. We will also explore how they are related, in a fundamental way, to the entropy production principles of irreversible thermodynamics. We believe that the introduction of variational alternatives for solving circuits can be a good opportunity for the instructor to present the techniques of the calculus of variations and irreversible thermodynamics to students."

In order to master the development cost and duration of such systems, an alternative to a manual design is to automatically synthesize the main parameters of the system. In this paper, we present an approach on the specific case of the scheduling of the flight control of a space launcher. The approach requires two successive steps: (1) the formalization of the problem to be solved in a parametric formal model and (2) the synthesis of the model parameters with a tool. We first describe the problematic of the scheduling of a launcher flight control, then we show how this problematic can be formalized with parametric stopwatch automata; we then present the results computed by IMITATOR. We compare the results to the ones obtained by other tools classically used in scheduling."

Inspired by constrained sparse signal recovery, this paper proposes a constrained matching pursuit algorithm and develops conditions for exact support and vector recovery on constraint sets via this algorithm. We show that exact recovery via constrained matching pursuit not only depends on a measurement matrix but also critically relies on a constraint set. We thus identify an important class of constraint sets, called coordinate projection admissible set, or simply CP admissible sets; analytic and geometric properties of these sets are established. We study exact vector recovery on convex, CP admissible cones for a fixed support. We provide sufficient exact recovery conditions for a general support as well as necessary and sufficient recovery conditions when a support has small size. As a byproduct, we construct a nontrivial counterexample to a renowned necessary condition of exact recovery via the OMP for a support of size three. Moreover, using the properties of convex CP admissible sets and convex optimization techniques, we establish sufficient conditions for uniform exact recovery on convex CP admissible sets in terms of the restricted isometry-like constant and the restricted orthogonality-like constant."

We look at the relations between the variety and the fixed locus of the involution from the point of view of cobordism. We show in particular that the fixed locus has dimension larger than its codimension when certain Chern numbers of the variety are not divisible by two, or four. Some of those results, but not all, are analogues of theorems in algebraic topology obtained by Conner-Floyd and Boardman in the sixties. We include versions of our results concerning the vanishing loci of idempotent global derivations in characteristic two. Our approach to cobordism, following Merkurjev's, is elementary, in the sense that it does not involve resolution of singularities or homotopical methods."

While the hyperbolic manifold is well-studied in the literature, it has gained interest in the machine learning and natural language processing communities lately due to its usefulness in modeling continuous hierarchies. Tasks with hierarchical structures are ubiquitous in those fields and there is a general interest to learning hyperbolic representations or embeddings of such tasks. Additionally, these embeddings of related tasks may also share a low-rank subspace. In this work, we propose to learn hyperbolic embeddings such that they also lie in a low-dimensional subspace. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a low-rank factorization of hyperbolic embeddings. We cast these problems as manifold optimization problems and propose computationally efficient algorithms. Empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

We study upper bounds for cyclotomic numbers $(a,b)$ of order $e$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. A general result of our study is that $(a,b)\leq 3$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ if $p> (\sqrt{14})^{k/ord_k(p)}$. More conclusive results will be obtained through separate investigation of the five types of cyclotomic numbers: $(0,0), (0,a), (a,0), (a,a)$ and $(a,b)$, where $a\neq b$ and $a,b \in \{1,\dots,e-1\}$. The main idea we use is to transform equations over $\mathbb{F}_q$ into equations over the field of complex numbers on which we have more information. A major tool for the improvements we obtain over known results is new upper bounds on the norm of cyclotomic integers."

We also extend these results and ideas to principally new and very general settings of arbitrary orthogonal projections of the vectors of the coefficients $(u_1, \ldots , u_d)$ onto a lower dimensional subspace. This new point of view has an additional advantage of yielding an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of sets of large Weyl sums.   Among other technical innovations, we also introduce a ``self-improving'' approach, which leads an infinite series of monotonically decreasing bound, converging to our final result."

In these systems only quantized observations are available for the network estimation. Furthermore, system states are coupled with observations, and the quantization parts are unknown inherent components, which hinder the design of inputs and quantizers. To fulfill the estimation, we propose a recursive algorithm based on stochastic approximation techniques. More precisely, to deal with the temporal dependency of observations and achieve the recursive estimation of network weights, a deterministic objective function is constructed based on the likelihood function by extending the dimension of observations and applying ergodic properties of Markov chains. It is shown that this function is strictly concave and has unique maximum identical to the true parameter vector. Finally, the strong consistency of the algorithm is established. Our recursive algorithm can be applied to online tasks like real-time decision-making and surveillance for networked systems. This work also provides a new scheme for the identification of systems with quantized observations."

However, the property of normalization (and therefore the one of soundness) was only conjectured. The difficulty for the proof of normalization is due to the simultaneous presence of dependent types (for the constructive part of the choice), of control operators (for classical logic), of coinductive objects (to encode functions of type ${\mathbb{N} \to A}$ into streams (${a_0},{a_1},...$)) and of lazy evaluation with sharing (for memoizing these coinductive objects). Elaborating on previous works, we introduce in this paper a variant of dPA${^\omega}$ presented as a sequent calculus. On the one hand, we take advantage of a variant of Krivine classical realizability that we developed to prove the normalization of classical call-by-need. On the other hand, we benefit from dL${_{\hat{tp}}}$, a classical sequent calculus with dependent types in which type safety is ensured by using delimited continuations together with a syntactic restriction. By combining the techniques developed in these papers, we manage to define a realizability interpretation \`a la Krivine of our calculus that allows us to prove normalization and soundness. This paper goes over the whole process, starting from Herbelin's calculus dPA${^\omega}$ until our introduction of its sequent calculus counterpart dLPA${^\omega}$."

In the more general case of a finite rank $2$ irreducible spherical building, also known as a \emph{generalized polygon}, the theorem of Fong and Seitz (1973) gave a classification of the \emph{Moufang} examples. A conjecture of Kantor, made in print in 1991, says that there are only two non-classical examples of flag-transitive generalized quadrangles up to duality. Recently, the authors made progress toward this conjecture by classifying those finite generalized quadrangles which have an automorphism group $G$ acting transitively on antiflags. In this paper, we take this classification much further by weakening the hypothesis to $G$ being transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points and ordered pairs of concurrent lines."

Additionally, we perform experiments to compare accuracy and speed of CN versus DL models. In DL models, we utilize Inception V3 and DenseNet V201 for powerful computers besides NASNet, MobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2 for small and embedded devices. We evaluate our models on a fingerspelling alphabet dataset from American Sign Language (ASL). The results show that CNs perform comparably to DL models while dramatically reducing training time.

However, in practice, resource constraints require decisions to be made based on partial network information. We investigated how the accuracy of network data available at individual and village levels affected network-based vaccination effectiveness. We simulated a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process on empirical social networks from 75 villages. First, we used regression to predict the percentage of individuals ever infected based on village-level network. Second, we simulated vaccinating 10 percent of each of the 75 empirical village networks at baseline, selecting vaccinees through one of five network-based approaches: random individuals; random contacts of random individuals; random high-degree individuals; highest degree individuals; or most central individuals. The first three approaches require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate (Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces the data collection burden but generates only partially observed networks. We found mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence. In simulations, the Nomination method reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds. The High Degree approach had intermediate effectiveness. Surprisingly, FCD truncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as using complete networks. Using even partial network information to prioritize vaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved epidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak settings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required."

The spatial and spectral structures of the synchrotron nebula are well-resolved from radio to hard X-ray emission. The un-pulsed emission at GeV to TeV energies is mostly produced via inverse-Compton scattering of energetic electrons with the synchrotron-emitted photons. The spatial structure observed at these energies provides insights into the distribution of electrons and indirectly constrains the so-far unknown structure of the magnetic field in the nebula. Analyzing the LAT data accumulated over $\sim$9.1 years with a properly refined model for the Crab pulsar's spectrum, we determined the 68\% containment radius ($R_{68}$) of the Crab Nebula to be $({0.0330\pm0.0025_{stat}}{^{+0.0012}_{-0.0075}}_{sys})^\circ$ (${1.98'\pm0.15'_{stat}}{^{+0.07'}_{-0.45'}}_{sys}$) in the 5--500 GeV band. The estimated systematic uncertainty is based on two factors: (1) different analysis methods, morphological models and event types, and (2) the point-spread-function evaluated with observations of Mkn 421. When comparing the \emph{Fermi} LAT and H.E.S.S. results on the spatial extension, we find evidence for an energy-dependent shrinking of the Crab Nebula's $\gamma$-ray extension ($R_{68}\propto E_\mathrm{IC}^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha=0.155\pm0.035_{stat}{-0.037}_{sys}$)."

As phonon dynamics and electron-phonon scattering play a critical role in the electrical and thermal transport, we pursue a fundamental understanding of the origin of these effects in type-I Weyl semimetals NbAs and TaAs. In the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of NbAs, we reveal a previously unreported Fano lineshape, a signature stemming from the electron-phonon interaction. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the $A_{1}$ phonon linewidths in both NbAs and TaAs strongly deviate from the standard model of anharmonic decay. To capture the mechanisms responsible for the observed Fano asymmetry and the atypical phonon linewidth, we present first principles calculations of the phonon self-energy correction due to the electron-phonon interaction. Finally, we investigate the relationship between Fano lineshape, electron-phonon coupling, and locations of the Weyl points in these materials. Through this study of the phonon dynamics and electron-phonon interaction in these Weyl semimetals, we consider specific microscopic pathways which contribute to the nature of their macroscopic transport."

Suppose we have a set of linear autonomous systems with bounded process noise, but the dynamics of each system are unknown. The goal of the application is to design a policy that stabilizes the system. The underlying question is how to estimate the dynamics of each system given that measurements of each system will be nonsequential. Though seemingly straightforward, existing proof techniques for proving statistical consistency of system identification procedures fail when measurements are nonsequential. Here, we provide an estimator that leverages boundedness of the process noise, and we prove its statistical consistency holds even when measurements are nonsequential. We illustrate the strong consistency (i.e., almost sure convergence) of our estimator by using it to construct a stabilizing policy for the motivating learning-based switched control application."

By increasing the electric field strength of laser pulses, the light-matter interaction in solids might turn from a perturbative into a novel non-perturbative regime, where interband transitions from the valence to the conduction band become strongly affected by intraband motion. We have demonstrated experimentally and numerically that this combined dynamics can be controlled in graphene with the electric field waveform of phase-stabilized few-cycle laser pulses. Here we show new experimental data and matching simulation results at comparably low optical fields, which allows us to focus on the highly interesting transition regime where the light-matter interaction turns from perturbative to non-perturbative. We find a 5th order power-law scaling of the laser induced waveform-dependent current at low optical fields, which breaks down for higher optical fields, indicating the transition."

Differential cross-sections are measured in events with exactly one electron and one muon with opposite-sign electric charge as a function of the azimuthal opening angle and the absolute difference in pseudorapidity between the electron and muon candidates in the laboratory frame. The azimuthal opening angle is also measured as a function of the invariant mass of the $t\bar{t}$ system. The measured differential cross-sections are compared to predictions by several NLO Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations. The observed degree of spin correlation is somewhat higher than predicted by the generators used. The data are consistent with the prediction of one of the fixed-order calculations at NLO, but agree less well with higher-order predictions. Using these leptonic observables, a search is performed for pair production of supersymmetric top squarks decaying into Standard Model top quarks and light neutralinos. Top squark masses between 170 and 230 GeV are largely excluded at the 95% confidence level for kinematically allowed values of the neutralino mass."

In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines."

Relations are given both for the case in which the target Lagrangian subspace is associated with the space of $L^2 ((0,\infty), \mathbb{C}^{n})$ solutions to the Sturm-Liouville System, and the case when the target Lagrangian subspace is associated with the space of solutions satisfying the boundary conditions at $x = 0$. In the former case, a formula of H\""ormander's is used to show that the target space can be replaced with the Dirichlet space, along with additional explicit terms. We illustrate our theory by applying it to an eigenvalue problem that arises when the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on a star graph is linearized about a half-soliton solution."

Most notably, transverse-field quantum annealing - the heuristic employed in current commercially-available quantum annealing machines - has been shown to often be exponentially biased when sampling the solution space. Here we present an approach to sample ground-state (or low-energy) configurations for binary optimization problems. The method samples degenerate states with almost equal probability and is based on a combination of parallel tempering Monte Carlo with isoenergetic cluster moves. We illustrate the approach using two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, as well as spin glasses on the D-Wave Systems Inc. quantum annealer chimera topology. In addition, a simple heuristic to approximate the number of solutions of a degenerate problem is introduced."

We report on a high-resolution multi-phase study of the nuclear environment in the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 2110 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope/SINFONI. We identify a region that is markedly weak in low-excitation CO $2\rightarrow1$ emission from cold molecular gas, but appears to be filled with ionised and warm molecular gas, which indicates that the AGN is directly influencing the properties of the molecular material. Using multiple molecular gas tracers, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of CO line emission, the surface densities and kinematics of molecular gas vary smoothly across the region. Our results demonstrate that the influence of an AGN on star-forming gas can be quite localized. In contrast to widely-held theoretical expectations, we find that molecular gas remains resilient to the glare of energetic AGN feedback."

For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data analysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data analysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data analysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis that is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal mechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each other. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and characterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the elements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the fundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis. This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data analyses."

The increase in the number density and solid-angle coverage of SNe~Ia, in parallel with improvements in the standardization of their absolute magnitudes, now make them competitive probes of the growth of structure and hence of gravity. The peculiar velocity power spectrum is sensitive to the growth index $\gamma$, which captures the effect of gravity on the linear growth of structure through the relation $f=\Omega_M^\gamma$. We present the first projections for the precision in $\gamma$ for a range of realistic SN peculiar-velocity survey scenarios. In the next decade the peculiar velocities of SNe~Ia in the local $z<0.3$ Universe will provide a measure of $\gamma$ to $\pm 0.01$ precision that can definitively distinguish between General Relativity and leading models of alternative gravity."

However, the quantitative extent to which putative antibiosignatures could exist in the atmospheres of inhabited planets is not well understood. The most commonly referenced potential antibiosignature is CO, because it represents a source of free energy and reduced carbon that is readily exploited by life on Earth and is thus often assumed to accumulate only in the absence of life. Yet, biospheres actively produce CO through biomass burning, photooxidation processes, and release of gases that are photochemically converted into CO in the atmosphere. We demonstrate with a 1D ecosphere-atmosphere model that reducing biospheres can maintain CO levels of ~100 ppmv even at low H2 fluxes due to the impact of hybrid photosynthetic ecosystems. Additionally, we show that photochemistry around M dwarf stars is particularly favorable for the buildup of CO, with plausible concentrations for inhabited, oxygen-rich planets extending from hundreds of ppm to several percent. Since CH4 buildup is also favored on these worlds, and because O2 and O3 are likely not detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, the presence of high CO (>100 ppmv) may discriminate between oxygen-rich and reducing biospheres with near-future transmission observations. These results suggest that spectroscopic detection of CO can be compatible with the presence of life and that a comprehensive contextual assessment is required to validate the significance of potential antibiosignatures."

Unfortunately, they face two major problems. First, the search is impaired due to a lexical gap between their query (task description) and the information associated with the solution. Second, the retrieved solution may not be comprehensive, i.e., the code segment might miss a succinct explanation. These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q&A threads and then mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier studies. We evaluate our approach using 48 programming queries and show that it outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, our evaluation with 29 developers using 24 tasks (queries) confirms the superiority of CROKAGE over the state-of-art tool in terms of relevance of the suggested code examples, benefit of the code explanations and the overall solution quality (code + explanation)."

Unlike prior methods that typically attempt to ground each phrase independently by building an image-text embedding, our architecture formulates grounding of multiple phrases as a sequential and contextual process. Specifically, we encode region proposals and all phrases into two stacks of LSTM cells, along with so-far grounded phrase-region pairs. These LSTM stacks collectively capture context for grounding of the next phrase. The resulting architecture, which we call SeqGROUND, supports many-to-many matching by allowing an image region to be matched to multiple phrases and vice versa. We show competitive performance on the Flickr30K benchmark dataset and, through ablation studies, validate the efficacy of sequential grounding as well as individual design choices in our model architecture."

However, the high computational complexity of DNNs often necessitates extremely fast and efficient hardware. The problem gets worse as the size of neural networks grows exponentially. As a result, customized hardware accelerators have been developed to accelerate DNN processing without sacrificing model accuracy. However, previous accelerator design studies have not fully considered the characteristics of the target applications, which may lead to sub-optimal architecture designs. On the other hand, new DNN models have been developed for better accuracy, but their compatibility with the underlying hardware accelerator is often overlooked. In this article, we propose an application-driven framework for architectural design space exploration of DNN accelerators. This framework is based on a hardware analytical model of individual DNN operations. It models the accelerator design task as a multi-dimensional optimization problem. We demonstrate that it can be efficaciously used in application-driven accelerator architecture design. Given a target DNN, the framework can generate efficient accelerator design solutions with optimized performance and area. Furthermore, we explore the opportunity to use the framework for accelerator configuration optimization under simultaneous diverse DNN applications. The framework is also capable of improving neural network models to best fit the underlying hardware resources."

Using symmetry arguments, we first show that this effect is quite general, and exists whenever the mirror symmetry in the direction of the magnetization is broken. We then demonstrate our result in a collinear ferromagnet on a square lattice, with perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction from mirror symmetry breaking. We show that the thermal Hall conductivity is controlled by the resonant contribution from the anti-crossing points between the magnon and phonon branches, and estimate its size to be comparable to that of the magnon mediated thermal Hall effect."

Their existence, arguably, spurs application innovations, making it easy to integrate data or functionalities. While previous work has analyzed the ecosystem of web APIs and their design, little is known about web API quality at runtime. This gap is critical, as qualities including availability, latency, or security can severely impact applications and user experience. In this paper, we revisit a 3-month, geo-distributed benchmark of popular web APIs, originally performed in 2015. We repeat this benchmark in 2018 and compare results from these two benchmarks regarding availability and latency. We furthermore introduce new results from assessing web API security measurements, collected both in 2015 and 2018, and results from our attempts to reach out to API providers with the results from our 2015 experiments. Our extensive experiments show that web API qualities vary 1.) based on the geo-distribution of clients, 2.) during our individual experiments, and 3.) between the two experiments. Our findings provide evidence to foster the discussion around web API quality, and can act as a basis for the creation of tools and approaches to mitigate quality issues."

In contrast, partition-based models are developed where data is divided and fitted by local models. These models partition the input space and do not leverage the input-output dependency of multimodal-distributed data, and strong local models are needed to make good predictions. Addressing these problems, we propose a binary tree-structured hierarchical routing mixture of experts (HRME) model that has classifiers as non-leaf node experts and simple regression models as leaf node experts. The classifier nodes jointly soft-partition the input-output space based on the natural separateness of multimodal data. This enables simple leaf experts to be effective for prediction. Further, we develop a probabilistic framework for the HRME model, and propose a recursive Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm to learn both the tree structure and the expert models. Experiments on a collection of regression tasks validate the effectiveness of our method compared to a variety of other regression models."

We apply these bijections to count the number of cores with various types of restriction, including fixed number of parts, limited size of parts, parts divisible by some integer, and distinct parts. For example, we prove that the number of $2t$-core partitions into $l$ even parts equals the number of $t$-core partitions into $l$ parts. We also generalize one expression for simultaneous cores, which was given by Baek, Nam and Yu, recently. Subsequently, we use this expression to obtain recurrence satisfied by numbers of $(s,s+1,\cdots,s+r)-$core partitions for $s\geq1$."

We use gravitational-wave measurements to address the question of whether GW170729's source, which is (probably) the most massive binary and the system with the highest effective inspiral spin, could contain a black hole which is a previous merger remnant. Using the inferred mass and spin of the system, and the empirically determined population of binary black holes, we compute the evidence for the binary being second-generation compared with first-generation. We find moderate evidence (a Bayes factor of ~6-7) that the mass and spin better match a second-generation merger, but folding in the expectation that only a small fraction of mergers are second-generation, we conclude that there is no strong evidence that GW170729 was the result of a second-generation merger. The results are sensitive to the assumed mass distribution, and future detections will provide more robust reconstructions of the binary black hole population."

However, the difference of intra-class targets can also be highlighted when enlarging the distance between different classes, and roughly persuing relaxed targets may lead to the problem of overfitting. To solve above problems, we propose a low-rank discriminative least squares regression model (LRDLSR) for multi-class image classification. Specifically, LRDLSR class-wisely imposes low-rank constraint on the intra-class regression targets to encourage its compactness and similarity. Moreover, LRDLSR introduces an additional regularization term on the learned targets to avoid the problem of overfitting. These two improvements are helpful to learn a more discriminative projection for regression and thus achieving better classification performance. Experimental results over a range of image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LRDLSR method."

Existing IL approaches tend to produce a model that is biased towards either the old classes or new classes, unless with the help of exemplars of the old data. To address this issue, we propose a class-incremental learning paradigm called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC), which works well even when the original training data is not available. The idea is to first train a separate model only for the new classes, and then combine the two individual models trained on data of two distinct set of classes (old classes and new classes) via a novel double distillation training objective. The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly available unlabeled auxiliary data. This overcomes the potential difficulties due to the unavailability of original training data. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, DMC demonstrates significantly better performance in image classification (CIFAR-100 and CUB-200) and object detection (PASCAL VOC 2007) in the single-headed IL setting."

Cellular networks are constantly evolving to meet the growing traffic demands. Over the past few years, wireless multicast has been garnering a lot of attention as a means of efficient resource utilization. Multicast transmission lets spectral resources to be shared between users streaming the same content. Even though multicast transmission allows to serve multiple users on the same resources, in order to serve all these users successfully, the base station cannot transmit the content at a rate greater than that decodable by the user with the worst channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a way to overcome this bottleneck. Video streaming services can sustain a certain amount of packet loss without any significant degradation in the quality experienced by the users. We leverage this loss tolerant nature of video streaming applications to improve the performance of multicast video services in LTE and 5G. We convert the problem of resource allocation for loss tolerant multicasting into the problem of stabilizing a queueing system. We then propose two throughput optimal Maximum Weight (MW) policies that successfully stabilize the constructed queueing system. However, brute force implementation of MW policies is mostly NP-hard. To overcome this, we propose a maximum weight bipartite matching approach that results in a polynomial time implementation of the proposed policies. We also evaluate the performance of our policies via extensive simulations."

In particular, the conjunction may coincide with the Product t-norm, the Minimum t-norm, and Lukasiewicz t-norm. We show by a counterexample, that the prevision assessments obtained by Lukasiewicz t-norm may be not coherent. Then, we give some conditions of coherence when using Lukasiewicz t-norm."

We turn this approximation into a very general and an in principle exact theory by introducing the concept of a connector, which is a prescription of how to use the results of a model system in order to simulate a real system. We set the conditions that must be fulfilled for the existence of an exact connector. We demonstrate that, and why, this approach is a very convenient starting point for approximations. We also show that the connector theory can be used to design new functionals, for example for density functional theory. We illustrate our purposes with simple examples."

We consider the subclass of these graphs for which each pair of vertices at distance two is joined by sufficiently many paths of length $2$. The number of such paths is known to be at most $2n$ by previous work of Blokhuis and Brouwer. We show that if each distance two pair is joined by at least $n-1$ paths of length $2$ then the diameter is bounded by $O(\log(n))$, while if each pair is joined by at least $2(n-1)$ such paths then the diameter is at most $3$ and we give a tight upper bound on the order of the graphs. We show that graphs meeting this upper bound are distance-regular antipodal covers of complete graphs. We exhibit an infinite family of such graphs which are locally $n \times n$ grid for odd prime powers $n$, and apply these results to locally $5 \times 5$ grid graphs to obtain a classification for the case where either all $\mu$-graphs have order at least $8$ or all $\mu$-graphs have order $c$ for some constant $c$."

In recent years many complex approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to address this problem. In this work we show that - surprisingly - a simple Constant Velocity Model can outperform even state-of-the-art neural models. This indicates that either neural networks are not able to make use of the additional information they are provided with, or that this information is not as relevant as commonly believed. Therefore, we analyze how neural networks process their input and how it impacts their predictions. Our analysis reveals pitfalls in training neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction and clarifies false assumptions about the problem itself. In particular, neural networks implicitly learn environmental priors that negatively impact their generalization capability, the motion history of pedestrians is irrelevant and interactions are too complex to predict. Our work shows how neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction can be thoroughly evaluated and our results indicate which research directions for neural motion prediction are promising in future."

We obtain H-T magnetic phase diagram for ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy using a two-sublattice model in the paramagnetic rare-earth ion approximation and taking into account rare-earth (Gd) magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that if the magnetic anisotropy of the $f$-sublattice is larger than that of the $d$-sublattice, the tricritical point can be at higher temperature than the compensation point. The obtained phase diagram explains the observed anomalous hysteresis loops as a result of high-field magnetic phase transition, the order of which changes with temperature. It also implies that in the vicinity of the magnetic compensation point the shape of magnetic hysteresis loop is strongly temperature dependent."

There is a paradigm shift towards collaborative development, which necessitates the need to evaluate this approach. A number of tools are used for collaborative software development (CSD) including social media and web 2.0 features.

The bootstrap method provides a convenient tool to include the effects of the systematic errors on the best values of $\alpha_{E1}$ and $\beta_{M1}$ and to propagate the statistical errors of the model parameters fixed by other measurements. We also implement various statistical tests to investigate the consistency of the available RCS data sets below pion-production threshold and we conclude that there are not strong motivations to exclude any data point from the global set. Our analysis yields $\alpha_{E1} = (12.03^{+0.48}_{-0.54})\times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\beta_{M1} = (1.77^{+0.52}_{-0.54})\times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$, with p-value $= 12\%$."

An example of a compound with such a phase transition is KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, which belongs to the family of the iron-based superconductors. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the phase transition on the structural, electronic, and dynamical properties of this compound. Performing the ab initio calculations, we reproduce the dependence of the lattice constants on pressure and analyze the changes of the inter-atomic distances in the tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal phases. Using the tight binding model with maximally localized Wannier orbitals, we calculate and discuss the influence of pressure on the electronic band structure as well as on the shape of the Fermi surface. We found a precursor of the phase transition in the form of enhancement of overlapping between two Wannier orbitals of As atoms. In order to better understand the superconducting properties of KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, we study the orbital-projected Cooper pairs susceptibility as a function of pressure. We found a decrease of susceptibility with the increasing pressure in a good qualitative agreement with experimental observation. The structural transition also influences the phonon spectrum of KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, which exhibits pronounced changes induced by pressure. Some phonon modes related with the vibrations of Fe and As atoms show an anomalous, nonmonotonic dependence on pressure close to the phase transition."

This is one of the very fundamental problems in range searching with a long history. Previously, Andrew Yao's influential result had shown that the problem is already non-trivial in one dimension~\cite{Yao-1Dlb}: using $m$ units of space, the query time $Q(n)$ must be $\Omega( \alpha(m,n) + \frac{n}{m-n+1})$ where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann's function, a very slowly growing function.   In $d$ dimensions, Bernard Chazelle~\cite{Chazelle.LB.II} proved that the query time must be $Q(n) = \Omega( (\log_\beta n)^{d-1})$ where $\beta = 2m/n$. Chazelle's lower bound is known to be tight for when space consumption is `high' i.e., $m = \Omega(n \log^{d+\varepsilon}n)$. We have two main results. The first is a lower bound that shows Chazelle's lower bound was not tight for `low space': we prove that we must have $m (n) = \Omega(n (\log n \log\log n)^{d-1})$. Our lower bound does not close the gap to the existing data structures, however, our second result is that our analysis is tight. Thus, we believe the gap is in fact natural since lower bounds are proven for idempotent semigroups while the data structures are built for general semigroups and thus they cannot assume (and use) the properties of an idempotent semigroup. As a result, we believe to close the gap one must study lower bounds for non-idempotent semigroups or building data structures for idempotent semigroups. We develope significantly new ideas for both of our results that could be useful in pursuing either of these directions."

It is a crucial ingredient in the theoretical study of the $\gamma W$ and $\gamma Z$ box diagrams that are known to suffer from large hadronic uncertainties. We demonstrate that for a given $Q^2$, one only needs to compute a small number of energy shifts in order to obtain the required inputs for the box diagrams.

Such a method usually involves the elimination of the fast degrees of freedom of the ""bath"" to which the particle is coupled. Specifically, we look into the general case where the bath may be at negative temperatures, as found - for instance - in models and experiments with bounded effective kinetic energy. Here, we generalise previous studies by considering the case in which the coarse-graining leads to (i) a renormalisation of the potential felt by the particle, and (ii) spatially dependent viscosity and diffusivity. In addition, a particular relevant example is provided, where the bath is a spin system and a sort of phase transition takes place when going from positive to negative temperatures. A Chapman-Enskog-like expansion allows us to rigorously derive the Fokker-Planck equation from the microscopic dynamics. Our theoretical predictions show an excellent agrement with numerical simulations."

Here we report the first quasi-linear theoretical approach of the whistler unstable branch able to characterize the long-term saturation of the instability as well as the relaxation of the electron velocity distributions. The instability saturation is not solely determined by the drift velocities, which undergo only a minor relaxation, but mainly from a concurrent interaction of electrons with whistlers that induces (opposite) temperature anisotropies of the core and beam populations and reduces the effective anisotropy. These results might be able to (i) explain the low intensity of the whistler heat-flux fluctuations in the solar wind (although other explanations remain possible and need further investigation), and (ii) confirm a reduced effectiveness of these fluctuations in the relaxation and isotropization of the electron strahl and in the regulation of the electron heat-flux."

A finite rank torsion-free abelian group $X$ is algebraically isomorphic to a canonical dense subgroup $X_G$ of its Pontryagin dual $G$. A morphism between protori lifts to a product morphism between the universal covers, so morphisms in the category can be studied as pairs of maps: homomorphisms between finitely generated profinite abelian groups and linear maps between finite-dimensional real vector spaces. A concept of non-Archimedean dimension is introduced which acts a useful invariant for classifying protori."

Our goal in this paper is to find a set of actuators minimizing the metric that measures the average energy consumption of the control inputs while ensuring structural controllability of the network. As this problem is intractable, greedy algorithm can be used to obtain an approximate solution. To provide a performance guarantee for this approach, we first define the submodularity ratio for the metric under consideration and then reformulate the structural controllability constraint as a matroid constraint. This shows that the problem under study can be characterized by a matroid optimization involving a weakly submodular objective function. Then, we derive a novel performance guarantee for the greedy algorithm applied to this class of optimization problems. Finally, we show that the matroid feasibility check for the greedy algorithm can be cast as a maximum matching problem in a certain auxiliary bipartite graph related to the network graph."

We present a review for the acceleration mechanisms related to the explosive phenomena (flares and/or CMEs) inside the solar corona. For more than 40 years, the main 2D cartoon representing our understanding of the explosive phenomena inside the solar corona remained almost unchanged. The acceleration mechanisms related to solar flares and CMEs also remained unchanged and were part of the same cartoon. In this review, we revise the standard cartoon and present evidence from recent global MHD simulations that supports the argument that explosive phenomena will lead to the spontaneous formation of current sheets in different parts of the erupting magnetic structure. The evolution of the large scale current sheets and their fragmentation will lead to strong turbulence and turbulent reconnection during solar flares and turbulent shocks. In other words, the acceleration mechanism in flares and CME-driven shocks may be the same, and their difference will be the overall magnetic topology, the ambient plasma parameters, and the duration of the unstable driver."

We correlate orbit families with phases of bar evolution by using empirical orthogonal functions that act as a spatial filter and form the gravitational potential basis. In both models we find evidence for three phases in evolution with unique harmonic signatures. We recover known analytic results, such as bar slowdown owing to angular momentum transfer. We also find new dynamical mechanisms for bar evolution: a steady-state equilibrium configuration and harmonic interaction resulting in harmonic mode locking, both of which may be observable. Additionally, we find that ellipse fitting may severely overestimate measurements of bar length by a factor of two relative to the measurements based on orbits that comprise the true backbone supporting the bar feature. The bias will lead to overestimates of both bar mass and bar pattern speed, affecting inferences about the evolution of bars in the real universe, such as the fraction of bars with fast pattern speeds. We propose a direct observational technique to compute the radial extent of trapped orbits and determine a dynamical length for the bar."

Such a theory predicts a linear excitation spectrum and provides expressions for the thermodynamic functions which are believed to be correct in the dilute limit. Thus far, there are only a few cases where the predictions of Bogoliubov can be obtained by means of rigorous mathematical analysis. A major challenge is to control the corrections beyond Bogoliubov theory, namely to test the validity of Bogoliubov's predictions in regimes where the approximations made by Bogoliubov are not valid. In these notes we discuss how this challenge can be addressed in the case of a system of N interacting bosons trapped in a box with volume one in the Gross-Pitaevskii limit, where the scattering length of the potential is of the order 1/N and N tends to infinity. This is a recent result obtained in [10] and [11], joint works with C. Boccato, C. Brennecke, and B. Schlein, which extend a previous result obtained in [8], removing the assumption of small interaction potential."

Large error bars on parameters as critical as transition energies and atomic cross sections can lead to unacceptable uncertainties in the calculations of e.g., elemental abundance, velocity, and temperature. Unless we address these issues, we risk limiting the full scientific potential of these missions. Laboratory astrophysics, which comprises theoretical and experimental studies of the underlying physics behind observable astrophysical processes, is therefore central to the success of these missions."

How do speakers choose from the wealth of referring expressions at their disposal? Rational theories of language use have come under attack for decades for not being able to account for the seemingly irrational overinformativeness ubiquitous in referring expressions. Here we present a novel production model of referring expressions within the Rational Speech Act framework that treats speakers as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of utterances. Crucially, we relax the assumption that informativeness is computed with respect to a deterministic Boolean semantics, in favor of a non-deterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a large number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the basic asymmetry in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light on the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully overinformative, reference is usefully redundant."

Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and Cellular V2X (C-V2X) are two present-day technologies that are capable of supporting day-1 vehicular applications. However, these RATs fall short of supporting communication requirements of many advanced vehicular applications, which are believed to be critical in enabling fully autonomous vehicles. Both DSRC and C-V2X are undergoing extensive enhancements in order to support advanced vehicular applications that are characterized by high reliability, low latency and high throughput requirements. These RAT evolutions---IEEE 802.11bd for DSRC and NR V2X for C-V2X---can supplement today's vehicular sensors in enabling autonomous driving. In this paper, we briefly describe the two present-day vehicular RATs. In doing so, we highlight their inability to guarantee quality of service requirements of many advanced vehicular applications. We then look at the two RAT evolutions, i.e., IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X and outline their objectives, describe their salient features and provide an in-depth description of key mechanisms that enable these features.

A closed subgroup $G$ of $S_\infty$ is called $\mathit{oligomorphic}$ if for each $n$, its natural action on $n$-tuples of natural numbers has only finitely many orbits. We show that the isomorphism relation for oligomorphic subgroups of $S_\infty$ is Borel reducible to a Borel equivalence relation with all classes countable. We show that the same upper bound applies to the larger class of groups topologically isomorphic to oligomorphic subgroups of $S_\infty$.   Given a closed subgroup $G$ of $S_\infty$, the coarse group $\mathcal{M}(G)$ is the structure whose domain consists of cosets of some open subgroups of $G$ and a single ternary relation $AB \sqsubseteq C$. If $G$ has only countably many open subgroups, this translates $G$ into a countable coarse group structure $\mathcal{M}(G)$ coding $G$. Coarse groups form our main tool in studying closed subgroups of $S_\infty$ with only countably many open subgroups."

We extend the theory to the visible sector and calculate the soft-SUSY breaking parameters depending on the modular weights in the superpotential and choice of K\""ahler potential. We are led to either no-scale SUGRA or pure gravity mediated SUSY breaking patterns, but with inflationary constraints on the Polonyi term setting a strict upper bound on the gravitino mass $m_{3/2} < 10^3$ TeV. Since gaugino masses are significantly lighter than $m_{3/2}$, this suggests that SUSY may be discovered at the LHC or FCC."

At each time step, a colored vertex with exactly one non-colored neighbor forces this non-colored neighbor to be colored. The initial set $F$ is called a forcing set of $G$ if, by iteratively applying the forcing process, every vertex in $G$ becomes colored. The forcing number of a graph $G$, denoted by $F(G)$, is the cardinality of a minimum forcing set of $G$. The maximum nullity of $G$, denoted by $M(G)$, is defined to be the largest possible nullity over all real symmetric matrices $A$ whose $a_{ij} \neq 0$ for $i \neq j$, whenever two vertices $u_{i}$ and $u_{j}$ of $G$ are adjacent. In this paper, we characterize all graphs $G$ of order $n$, maximum degree at most three, and $F(G)=3$. Also we classify these graphs with their maximum nullity."

This represents a continuation of the work on the stability analysis of the method. The theoretical result suggests that the rapid solver method is both convergent and second order accurate with respect to time step $\Delta t.$ A wide set of numerical evidences confirm this theoretical analysis.

We consider two types of boxes: square and circle. In a square-shaped 2D box trap, when the number of generated vortices is the square of an integer, the vortices are found to be arranged in a perfect square lattice, although deviations near the center are found when the number of generated vortices is arbitrary. In case of a circular box trap, the generated vortices in the rapidly rotating BEC lie on concentric closed orbits. Near the center, these orbits have the shape of polygons, whereas near the periphery the orbits are circles. The circular box trap is equivalent to the rotating cylindrical bucket used in early experiment(s) with liquid He II. The number of generated vortices in both cases is in qualitative agreement with Feynman's universal estimate. The numerical simulation for this study is performed by a solution of the underlying mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in the rotating frame, where the wave function for the generated vortex lattice is a stationary state. Consequently, the imaginary-time propagation method can be used for a solution of the GP equation, known to lead to an accurate numerical solution. We also demonstrated the dynamical stability of the vortex lattices in real-time propagation upon a small change of the angular frequency of rotation, using the converged imaginary-time wave function as the initial state."

Known vector spherical wavefunctions are used to represent the fields in the surrounding matter-free space. After deriving closed-form expressions for the vector spherical wavefunctions for the scattering material, the internal fields are represented as superpositions of those vector spherical wavefunctions. The unknown scattered-field coefficients are related to the known incident-field coefficients by a transition matrix. The total scattering and absorption efficiencies are highly affected by the orientation of the constitutive principal axes relative to the shape principal axes, and the effect of the orientational mismatch between the two sets of principal axes is more pronounced as the electrical size increases. The dependence of the total scattering efficiency, but not of the absorption efficiency, on the angle of rotation about a shape principal axis can be predicted qualitatively from the variation of a scalar function with respect to the angle of rotation. The total scattering and absorption efficiencies do not depend on the polarization state of incident plane wave when the scattering material is impedance-matched to free space. The polarization state of the incident plane wave has a more discernible effect on the total scattering and absorption efficiencies for ellipsoids compared to spheres."

This change is characterised by the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines, often associated with dramatic AGN continuum flux changes that are orders of magnitude larger than those expected from typical AGN variability. In this work we study for the first time the host galaxy of a changing-look AGN, Mrk 590, using high spatial resolution optical and near-infrared observations. We discover that after ~ 10 yr absence, the optical broad emission lines of Mrk 590 have reappeared. The AGN optical continuum flux however, is still ~ 10 times lower than that observed during the most luminous state in the 1990s. The host galaxy shows a 4.5 kpc radius star-forming ring with knots of ionised and cold molecular gas emission. Extended ionised and warm molecular gas emission are detected in the nucleus, indicating that there is a reservoir of gas as close as 60 pc from the black hole. We observe a nuclear gas spiral between radii r ~ 0.5 - 2 kpc, which has been suggested as a dynamical mechanism able to drive the necessary gas to fuel AGN. We also discover blue-shifted and high velocity dispersion [O III] emission out to a radius of 1 kpc, tracing a nuclear gas outflow. The gas dynamics in Mrk 590 suggest a complex balance between gas inflow and outflow in the nucleus of the galaxy."

We extend our previous work on the resummation of the semi-inclusive photon energy spectrum in $\chi^0\chi^0\to \gamma+X$ in the vicinity of the maximal photon energy $E_\gamma = m_\chi$ with NLL' accuracy from the case of narrow photon energy resolution $E^\gamma_{\rm res}$ of order $m_W^2/m_\chi$ to intermediate resolution of order $E^\gamma_{\rm res} \sim m_W$. We also provide details on the previous narrow resolution calculation. The two calculations, performed in different effective field theory set-ups for the wino dark matter model, are then shown to match well, providing an accurate representation up to energy resolutions of about 300 GeV."

The grism spectra are from the Probing Evolution And Reionization Spectroscopically (PEARS) survey with {\it HST} using the G800L grism on the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The photometric data come from a compilation by the 3D-HST collaboration of imaging from multiple surveys (notably CANDELS and 3D-HST). We show evidence that spectrophotometric redshifts (SPZs) typically improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts by $\sim$17--60\%. Our SPZ method is a template fitting based routine which accounts for correlated data between neighboring points within grism spectra via the covariance matrix formalism and also accounts for galaxy morphology along the dispersion direction. We show that the robustness of the SPZ is directly related to the fidelity of the D4000 measurement. We also estimate the accuracy of continuum-based redshifts, i.e., for galaxies that do not contain strong emission lines, based on the grism data alone ($\sigma^{\rm NMAD}_{\Delta z/(1+z)}{\lesssim}0.06$). Given that future space-based observatories like WFIRST and Euclid will spend a significant fraction of time on slitless spectroscopic observations, we estimate number densities for objects with $\ | \mathrm{\Delta z/(1+z_{s})} \ | \leq 0.02$. We predict $\sim$700--4400 galaxies/degree$^2$ for galaxies with D4000$>$1.1 and $\ | \mathrm{\Delta z/(1+z_{s})} \ | \leq 0.02$ to a limiting depth of $i_{AB}$=24 mag. This is \emph{especially} important in the absence of an accompanying rich photometric dataset like the existing one for the CANDELS fields, where redshift accuracy from future surveys will rely only on the presence of a feature like the 4000\AA/Balmer breaks or the presence of emission lines within the grism spectra."

Here, we present an optimally mode-matched, periodically poled lithium niobate nanowaveguide for efficient parametric frequency conversions on chip. Using a 4-mm nanowaveguide with subwavelength mode confinement, we demonstrate second harmonic generation with efficiency over $2200\%~W^{-1}cm^{-2}$, and broadband difference frequency generation with similar efficiency over a 4.5-THz spectral span. These allow us to generate correlated photon pairs over multiple frequency channels via spontaneous parametric down conversion, all in their fundamental spatial modes, with a coincidence to accidental ratio as high as 600. The high efficiency and dense integrability of the present chip devices may pave a viable route to scalable nonlinear applications in both classical and quantum domains."

Recently, Michael Scheutzow discovered a stochastic Gronwall inequality which provides upper bounds for $p$-th moments, $p\in(0,1)$, of the supremum of nonnegative scalar continuous processes which satisfy a linear integral inequality. In this article we complement this with upper bounds for $p$-th moments, $p\in[2,\infty)$, of the supremum of general It\^o processes which satisfy a suitable one-sided affine-linear growth condition. As example applications, we improve known results on strong local Lipschitz continuity in the starting point of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), on (exponential) moment estimates for SDEs, on strong completeness of SDEs, and on perturbation estimates for SDEs."

We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints, and offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm that admits any batch reinforcement learning and online learning procedure as subroutines. We then present a specific algorithmic instantiation and provide performance guarantees for the main objective and all constraints. To certify constraint satisfaction, we propose a new and simple method for off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and derive PAC-style bounds. Our algorithm achieves strong empirical results in different domains, including in a challenging problem of simulated car driving subject to multiple constraints such as lane keeping and smooth driving. We also show experimentally that our OPE method outperforms other popular OPE techniques on a standalone basis, especially in a high-dimensional setting."

This scenario simultaneously resolves the $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies, the dark matter puzzle and the long-standing discrepancy in muon's anomalous magnetic moment. A complex scalar ($\eta$) having nonzero ${L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ charge has been introduced to break this new U(1) symmetry spontaneously. Moreover, for the purpose of studying dark matter phenomenology and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies in a correlated manner, we introduce an inert ${\rm SU(2)}_L$ scalar doublet ($\Phi$), a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real singlet scalar ($S$) and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd coloured fermion ($\chi$) which transforms vectorially under the ${\rm U(1)}_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry. This extra gauge symmetry provides a new gauge boson $Z_{\mu\tau}$ which not only gives additional contribution to both $b\to s \ell\ell$ transition and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ but also provides a crucial annihilation channel for dark matter candidate $\rho_1$ of the present scenario. This $\rho_1$ is an admixture of CP-even neutral component of $\Phi$ and $S$. Our analysis shows that the low mass dark matter regime ($M_{\rho_1}\lesssim 60$ GeV) is still allowed by the experiments like XENON1T, LHC (via Higgs invisible branching) and Fermi-LAT, making the dark matter phenomenology drastically different from the standard Inert Doublet and the Scalar Singlet models. Furthermore, the present model is also fairly consistent with the observed branching ratio of $B\to X_s\gamma$ in $3\sigma$ range and is quite capable of explaining neutrino masses and mixings via Type-I seesaw mechanism if we add three right handed neutrinos in the particle spectrum. Finally, we use the latest ATLAS data of non-observation of a resonant $\ell^+\ell^-$ signal at the 13 TeV LHC to constrain the mass-coupling plane of $Z_{\mu\tau}$."

However, it is difficult to deploy the state-of-the-art deep CNNs for industrial use due to the difficulty of manually fine-tuning the hyperparameters and the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective optimization method for evolving state-of-the-art deep CNNs in real-life applications, which automatically evolves the non-dominant solutions at the Pareto front. Three major contributions are made: Firstly, a new encoding strategy is designed to encode one of the best state-of-the-art CNNs; With the classification accuracy and the number of floating point operations as the two objectives, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is developed to evolve the non-dominant solutions; Last but not least, a new infrastructure is designed to boost the experiments by concurrently running the experiments on multiple GPUs across multiple machines, and a Python library is developed and released to manage the infrastructure. The experimental results demonstrate that the non-dominant solutions found by the proposed algorithm form a clear Pareto front, and the proposed infrastructure is able to almost linearly reduce the running time."

This conversion is shown to be polynomial time efficient with block length and is applicable to any channel. When an ECC is chosen, our procedure induces a wiretap coding scheme that is concrete and efficient as long as the ECC is also such. To prove this induced wiretap coding scheme is semantically secure, we have constructed bounds on the information leaked to the eavesdropper. Our construction is an upgrade of bounds from recent literature: the novelty here being that our leakage bounds hold for any message distribution. Indeed, our wiretap procedure using UHFs and our characterization of its semantic leakage is the first main contribution of this work. The other main contribution of this work is as follows. We apply the aforementioned procedure to a variety of wiretap channels in order to show the procedure's efficacy, and as a result of such applications, our results establish new achievable semantically secure rates."

The key blocks of the proposed CNN, including convolution and down-sampling, are directly defined in a vertex domain. By exploiting the ordering property of semi-regular meshes, the convolution is defined on a vertex domain with strong motivation from the spatial definition of classic convolution. Moreover, the down-sampling of a semi-regular mesh embedded in a 3D Euclidean space can achieve a down-sampling rate of 4, 16, 64, etc. We demonstrated the use of this vertex-based graph CNN for the classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on 3169 MRI scans of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

However, the sorting operator is non-differentiable with respect to its inputs, which prohibits end-to-end gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose NeuralSort, a general-purpose continuous relaxation of the output of the sorting operator from permutation matrices to the set of unimodal row-stochastic matrices, where every row sums to one and has a distinct arg max. This relaxation permits straight-through optimization of any computational graph involve a sorting operation. Further, we use this relaxation to enable gradient-based stochastic optimization over the combinatorially large space of permutations by deriving a reparameterized gradient estimator for the Plackett-Luce family of distributions over permutations. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework on three tasks that require learning semantic orderings of high-dimensional objects, including a fully differentiable, parameterized extension of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm."

We use a 2036 qubit D-Wave quantum annealer to perform track clustering in a limited capacity on artificial events where the positions of primary vertices and tracks resemble those measured by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm, which is not a classical-quantum hybrid but relies entirely on quantum annealing, is tested on a variety of event topologies from 2 primary vertices and 10 tracks up to 5 primary vertices and 15 tracks. It is benchmarked against simulated annealing executed on a commercial CPU constrained to the same processor time per anneal as time in the physical annealer, and performance is found to be comparable with an intriguing quantum advantage noted for 2 vertices and 16 tracks."

Currently, two main factors prevent wireless network operators from building such networks: 1) the lack of control of the wireless environment, whose impact on the radio waves cannot be customized, and 2) the current operation of wireless radios, which consume a lot of power because new signals are generated whenever data has to be transmitted.   In this paper, we challenge the usual ""more data needs more power and emission of radio waves"" status quo, and motivate that future wireless networks necessitate a smart radio environment: A transformative wireless concept, where the environmental objects are coated with artificial thin films of electromagnetic and reconfigurable material (that are referred to as intelligent reconfigurable meta-surfaces), which are capable of sensing the environment and of applying customized transformations to the radio waves. Smart radio environments have the potential to provide future wireless networks with uninterrupted wireless connectivity, and with the capability of transmitting data without generating new signals but recycling existing radio waves.   This paper overviews the current research efforts on smart radio environments, the enabling technologies to realize them in practice, the need of new communication-theoretic models for their analysis and design, and the long-term and open research issues to be solved towards their massive deployment. In a nutshell, this paper is focused on discussing how the availability of intelligent reconfigurable meta-surfaces will allow wireless network operators to redesign common and well-known network communication paradigms."

A fast dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique is presented which allows the processing elements (PE) to change their supply voltage and clock frequency individually and autonomously within less than 100 ns. This is employed by the neuromorphic simulation software flow, which defines the performance level (PL) of the PE based on the actual workload within each simulation cycle. A test chip in 28 nm SLP CMOS technology has been implemented. It includes 4 PEs which can be scaled from 0.7 V to 1.0 V with frequencies from 125 MHz to 500 MHz at three distinct PLs. By measurement of three neuromorphic benchmarks it is shown that the total PE power consumption can be reduced by 75%, with 80% baseline power reduction and a 50% reduction of energy per neuron and synapse computation, all while maintaining temporary peak system performance to achieve biological real-time operation of the system. A numerical model of this power management model is derived which allows DVFS architecture exploration for neuromorphics.

Unimpeded by the high dust optical depths that affect shorter wavelength observations, the high brightness temperature of these emission lines offers a way to resolve accretion and outflow motions down to scales below $\sim$1 au in deeply embedded Galactic star-forming regions at kiloparsec distances. The recent identification of extraordinary accretion outbursts in two high-mass protostars, both of which were heralded by maser flares, has rapidly impacted the traditional view of massive protostellar evolution, leading to new hydrodynamic simulations that can produce such episodic outbursts. In order to understand how these massive protostars evolve in response to such events, larger, more sensitive ground-based centimeter wavelength interferometers are needed that can simultaneously image multiple maser species in the molecular gas along with faint continuum from the central ionized gas. Fiducial observations of a large sample of massive protostars will be essential in order to pinpoint the progenitors of future accretion outbursts, and to quantify the outburst-induced changes in their protostellar photospheres and outflow and accretion structures. Knowledge gained from these studies will have broader impact on the general topic of accretion onto massive objects."

Because the power flow equations in large electrical grid networks are non-convex equality constraints, we develop a tailored state estimator based on Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method, which can handle the nonlinearities efficiently. Here, our focus is on using Gauss-Newton Hessian approximations within ALADIN in order to arrive at at an efficient (computationally and communicationally) variant of ALADIN for network maximum likelihood estimation problems. Analyzing the IEEE 30-Bus system we illustrate how the proposed algorithm can be used to solve highly non-trivial network state estimation problems. We also compare the method with existing distributed parameter estimation codes in order to illustrate its performance."

Measurements, predictions and empirical model","Transmission spectra of H$_2$O+CO$_2$ mixtures have been recorded, at 296, 325 and 366 K, for various pressures and mixture compositions using two experimental setups. Their analysis enables to retrieve values of the 'continuum' absorption by the CO$_2$-broadened H$_2$O line wings between 100 and 1500 cm$^{-1}$. The results are in good agreement with those, around 1300 cm$^{-1}$, of the single previous experimental study available. Comparisons are also made with direct predictions based on line-shape correction factors $\chi$ calculated, almost thirty years ago, using a quasistatic approach and an input H$_2$O-CO$_2$ intermolecular potential. They show that this model quite nicely predicts, with slightly overestimated values, the continuum over a spectral range where it varies by more than three orders of magnitude. An empirical correction is proposed, based on the experimental data, which should be useful for radiative transfer and climate studies in CO$_2$ rich planetary atmospheres."

The experimental spin-flip and momentum scattering rates and their dependence on the density of fluorine and carrier doping are obtained through weak localization and conductivity measurements, respectively, and suggest the role of fluorine as resonant magnetic impurities. For the estimated fluorine concentration of a few 100 ppm, the observed spin lifetimes are in the range of 1-10\,ps. Theoretically, we established tight-binding electronic structures of fluorinated graphene and bilayer graphene by fitting to density functional supercell calculations and performed a comprehensive analysis of the spin-flip and momentum scattering rates within the same devices, aiming to develop a consistent description of both scattering channels. We find that resonant scattering in graphene is very sensitive to the precise position of the resonance level, as well as to the magnitude of the exchange coupling between itinerant carriers and localized spins. The experimental data point to the presence of weak spin-flip scatterers that, at the same time, relax the electron momentum strongly, nearly preserving the electron-hole symmetry. Such scatterers would exhibit resonance energies much closer to the neutrality point than what density functional theory predicts in the dilute limit. The inclusion of a magnetic moment on fluorine adatoms allowed us to qualitatively capture the carrier density dependence of the experimental rates but predicts a greater (weaker) spin (momentum) relaxation rate than the measurements. We discuss possible scenarios that may be responsible for the discrepancies. Our systematic study exposes the complexities involved in accurately capturing the behavior of adatoms on graphene."

Besides rate and resource control, the utilization of mobile nodes has also been suggested as a way to control congestion. In this work, we present a Mobile Congestion Control (MobileCC) algorithm with two variations, to assist existing congestion control algorithms in facing congestion in WSNs. The first variation employs mobile nodes that create locally-significant alternative paths leading to the sink. The second variation employs mobile nodes that create completely individual (disjoint) paths to the sink. Simulation results show that both variations can significantly contribute to the alleviation of congestion in WSNs."

Our convergence result for SVAG is the first to simultaneously capture both the biased low-variance method SAG and the unbiased high-variance method SAGA.

The task becomes more complex when the only available sensor is a static single camera (monocular vision). In this regard, we propose a monocular vision assisted localization algorithm, that will help a UAV to navigate safely in indoor corridor environments. Always, the aim is to navigate the UAV through a corridor in the forward direction by keeping it at the center with no orientation either to the left or right side. The algorithm makes use of the RGB image, captured from the UAV front camera, and passes it through a trained deep neural network (DNN) to predict the position of the UAV as either on the left or center or right side of the corridor. Depending upon the divergence of the UAV with respect to the central bisector line (CBL) of the corridor, a suitable command is generated to bring the UAV to the center. When the UAV is at the center of the corridor, a new image is passed through another trained DNN to predict the orientation of the UAV with respect to the CBL of the corridor. If the UAV is either left or right tilted, an appropriate command is generated to rectify the orientation. We also propose a new corridor dataset, named NITRCorrV1, which contains images as captured by the UAV front camera when the UAV is at all possible locations of a variety of corridors. An exhaustive set of experiments in different corridors reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

Given five point correspondences, the classical five-point method can be used to calculate the essential matrix efficiently. For the non-minimal $N$ ($N > 5$) inlier point correspondences, which is called $N$-point problem, existing methods are either inefficient or prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal and efficient solver for the $N$-point problem. First we formulate the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Then a globally optimal solution to this problem is obtained by semidefinite relaxation. This allows us to obtain certifiably globally optimal solutions to the original non-convex QCQP in polynomial time. The theoretical guarantees of the semidefinite relaxation are also provided, including the tightness and local stability. To deal with outliers, we also propose a robust $N$-point method using M-estimator. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated that our $N$-point method is $2\sim3$ orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-minimal solvers. Besides, our robust $N$-point method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and accuracy."

From classifying hand-written characters of different alphabets to figuring out how to play several Atari games using reinforcement learning, multi-task models have been able to widen their performance range across different tasks, although these tasks are usually of a similar nature. In this work, we attempt to widen this range even further, by including heterogeneous tasks in a single learning procedure. To do so, we firstly formally define a multi-network model, identifying the necessary components and characteristics to allow different adaptations of said model depending on the tasks it is required to fulfill. Secondly, employing the formal definition as a starting point, we develop an illustrative model example consisting of three different tasks (classification, regression and data sampling). The performance of this model implementation is then analyzed, showing its capabilities. Motivated by the results of the analysis, we enumerate a set of open challenges and future research lines over which the full potential of the proposed model definition can be exploited."

A regular simplex is a simple type of ETF in which the number of vectors is one more than the dimension of the underlying space. More sophisticated examples include harmonic ETFs which equate to difference sets in finite abelian groups. Recently, it was shown that some harmonic ETFs are comprised of regular simplices. In this paper, we continue the investigation into these special harmonic ETFs. We begin by characterizing when the subspaces that are spanned by the ETF's regular simplices form an equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF), which is a type of optimal packing in a Grassmannian space. We shall see that every difference set that produces an EITFF in this way also yields a complex circulant conference matrix. Next, we consider a subclass of these difference sets that can be factored in terms of a smaller difference set and a relative difference set. It turns out that these relative difference sets lend themselves to a second, related and yet distinct, construction of complex circulant conference matrices. Finally, we provide explicit infinite families of ETFs to which this theory applies."

Event detection, as an important part of event-based NILM methods, has a direct impact on the accuracy of the ultimate load disaggregation results in the entire NILM framework. This paper presents a hybrid event detection approach for relatively complex household load datasets that include appliances with long transients, high fluctuations, and/or near-simultaneous actions. The proposed approach includes a base algorithm based on moving average change with time limit, and two auxiliary algorithms based on derivative analysis and filtering analysis. The structure, steps, and working principle of this approach are described in detail. The proposed approach does not require additional information about household appliances, nor does it require any training sets. Case studies on different datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with several existing approaches including log likelihood ratio detector with maxima (LLD-Max) approach, active window-based (AWB) approach, and generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) approach. Results show that the proposed approach works well in detecting events in complex household load datasets and performs better than the existing approaches."

The system is optimized for long range teleoperation tasks under time-delay network conditions and does not require prior knowledge of the remote scene. Our system initializes with a self exploration behavior that senses the remote surroundings through a freely mounted eye-in-hand web cam. The self exploration stage estimates hand-eye calibration and provides a telepresence interface via real-time 3D geometric reconstruction. The human operator is able to specify a visual task through the interface and a coarse-to-fine controller guides the remote robot enabling our system to work in high latency networks. Large motions are guided by coarse 3D estimation, whereas fine motions use image cues (IBVS). Network data transmission cost is minimized by sending only sparse points and a final image to the human side. Experiments from Singapore to Canada on multiple tasks were conducted to show our system's capability to work in long range teleoperation tasks."

We address the problem by focussing on a prototype of such ensemble system, namely, the ensemble of Bloch equations. The dynamics of the equations are structurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and radio frequency (rf) inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of every individual system is unknown and, moreover, the population density of these individual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that at any time, there is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement output integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual systems, over the continuum ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the paper is thus the following: Whether one is able to use the common control input (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate the initial states of the individual systems and, moreover, to identify the population density? Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition for the ensemble system to be observable: We show that if the common observation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive degree, then the ensemble system is observable. The main focus of the paper is to demonstrate how to leverage tools from representation theory of Lie algebras to address the observability problem. Although the results we establish in the paper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations, the approach we develop along the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other general ensembles of nonholonomic control systems with a single, integrated measurement output."

However, its computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of time-series. Although there have been algorithms developed that are linear in the number of time-series, they are generally quadratic in time-series length. The exception is generalized time warping (GTW), which has linear computational cost. Yet, it can only identify simple time warping functions. There is a need for a new fast, high-quality multisequence alignment algorithm. We introduce trainable time warping (TTW), whose complexity is linear in both the number and the length of time-series. TTW performs alignment in the continuous-time domain using a sinc convolutional kernel and a gradient-based optimization technique. We compare TTW and GTW on 85 UCR datasets in time-series averaging and classification. TTW outperforms GTW on 67.1% of the datasets for the averaging tasks, and 61.2% of the datasets for the classification tasks."

Although a smaller line of work considers physical adversarial attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of interest, e.g., putting a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or manufacturing an object specifically intended to be misclassified. In this work, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep classifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically manipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully crafted and mainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create universal perturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify target objects as a different (targeted) class. To accomplish this, we propose an iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation (to make it adversarial for a given classifier), and the threat model itself (to ensure it is physically realizable). For example, we show that we can achieve physically-realizable attacks that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted fashion 49.6% of the time. This presents a new class of physically-realizable threat models to consider in the context of adversarially robust machine learning. Our demo video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/wUVmL33Fx54"

The largest gain would come from improvements to LSST photometric redshifts, which are employed directly or indirectly for every major LSST cosmological probe; deep spectroscopic datasets will enable reduced uncertainties in the redshifts of individual objects via optimized training. Such spectroscopy will also determine the relationship of galaxy SEDs to their environments, key observables for studies of galaxy evolution. The resulting data will also constrain the impact of blending on photo-z's. Focused spectroscopic campaigns can also improve weak lensing cosmology by constraining the intrinsic alignments between the orientations of galaxies. Galaxy cluster studies can be enhanced by measuring motions of galaxies in and around clusters and by testing photo-z performance in regions of high density. Photometric redshift and intrinsic alignment studies are best-suited to instruments on large-aperture telescopes with wider fields of view (e.g., Subaru/PFS, MSE, or GMT/MANIFEST) but cluster investigations can be pursued with smaller-field instruments (e.g., Gemini/GMOS, Keck/DEIMOS, or TMT/WFOS), so deep MOS work can be distributed amongst a variety of telescopes. However, community access to large amounts of nights for surveys will still be needed to accomplish this work. In two companion white papers we present gains from shallower, wide-area MOS and from single-target imaging and spectroscopy."

The satellite-tracked movements of hundreds of drifters deployed by research and voluntary observing vessels provide high-frequency and high-resolution information on near-surface currents around the globe. Consequently, they constitute a major component of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). However, maintaining this array is costly and in some oceanic regions such as the tropics, spatio-temporal coverage is limited. Here, we demonstrate that the GPS-buoy equipped fish aggregating devices (FADs) used in tropical tuna fisheries to increase fish catchability are also capable of providing comparable near-surface current information. We analyzed millions of position data collected between 2008 and 2014 from more than 15,000 FADs and 2,000 drifters, and combined this information with remotely-sensed near-surface current data to demonstrate that the surface velocity components of FADs and drifters are highly correlated in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While it was noted that the subsurface structures of FADs (typically made of recycled fishing nets) did slow them down relative to the drifters, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean, this bias was measurable and could be accounted for in future studies. Our findings show that the physical meteorological and oceanographic data collected by fishermen could provide an invaluable source of information to the GOOS. Furthermore, by forging closer collaborations with the fishing industry and ensuring their contributions to global ocean databases are properly acknowledged, there is significant scope to capture this data more effectively."

Rather than use expensive custom hardware, our ERHARD-RNG Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) utilizes entropy sources that are already common in a range of low-cost embedded platforms. We empirically evaluate the entropy provided by three sources---SRAM startup state, oscillator jitter, and device temperature---and integrate those sources into a full Pseudo-Random Number Generator implementation based on Fortuna. Our system addresses a number of fundamental challenges affecting random number generation on embedded systems. For instance, we propose SRAM startup state as a means to efficiently generate the initial seed---even for systems that do not have writeable storage. Further, the system's use of oscillator jitter allows for the continuous collection of entropy-generating events---even for systems that do not have the user-generated events that are commonly used in general-purpose systems for entropy, e.g., key presses or network events."

Our goal is to facilitate the integration of QoS constraints in the development of industrial IoT applications to make them more reliable. We follow an approach based on two semantic models: The first model allows to design the workflow of an IoT application and to express application-level QoS requirements on its interactions. The second model captures the configuration of a network and can be used as input to a north-bound interface of an SDN controller. Finally, we make use of rule-based semantic reasoning to automatically translate from the application requirements into SDN parameters."

With the recent launch of NASA TESS space mission, we have confirmed our entrance to the era of all-sky observations of oscillating stars. TESS is currently releasing good quality datasets that already allow for the characterization and identification of individual oscillation modes even from single 27-days shots on some stars. When ESA PLATO will become operative by the next decade, we will face the observation of several more hundred thousands stars where identifying individual oscillation modes will be possible. However, estimating the individual frequency, amplitude, and lifetime of the oscillation modes is not an easy task. This is because solar-like oscillations and especially their evolved version, the red giant branch (RGB) oscillations, can vary significantly from one star to another depending on its specific stage of the evolution, mass, effective temperature, metallicity, as well as on its level of rotation and magnetism. In this perspective I will present a novel, fast, and powerful way to derive individual oscillation mode frequencies by building on previous results obtained with \diamonds. I will show that the oscillation frequencies obtained with this new approach can reach precisions of about 0.1 % and accuracies of about 0.01 % when compared to published literature values for the RGB star KIC~12008916."

Gyrotaxis has, in recent years, become a paradigmatic model for phytoplankton motility in flows. The essential attractiveness of this peculiar form of motility is the availability of a mechanistic description which, despite its simplicity, revealed predictive, rich in phenomenology, easily complemented to include the effects of shape, feed-back on the fluid and stochasticity (e.g. in cell orientation). In this review we consider recent theoretical, numerical and experimental results to discuss how, depending on flow properties, gyrotaxis can produce inhomogeneous phytoplankton distributions on a wide range of scales, from millimeters to kilometers, in both laminar and turbulent flows. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon of gyrotactic trapping in nonlinear shear flows and in fractal clustering in turbulent flows. We shall demonstrate the usefulness of ideas and tools borrowed from dynamical systems theory in explaining and interpreting these phenomena."

Our method is summarized as follows. First, we store the binary values of the monochrome image of target roadmap (one and zero represent the road and the other areas, respectively) in the two-dimensional square map. Second, we recursively divide the square map into sub-leafs by a quadtree until the summed-up value of pixels included inside the leaf becomes equal to or less than one. Third, we gradually remove the distal leaves that are adjacent to the leaves whose depths are shallower than the distal leaf. After that, we trace the remaining distal leaves of the tree using Morton's space-filling curve, while selecting the leaves that keep a certain distance among the previously selected leaves as the nodes of the graph. Finally, each selected node searches the neighboring nodes and stores them as the edges of the graph. We demonstrate our method by generating a centerline graph from a complex roadmap of a real-world airport and by carrying out a typical network analysis using Dijkstra's method."

The main aim was to observe at a frequency high enough to avoid strong depolarization at intermediate Galactic latitudes (still present at 1.4 GHz) to study Galactic magnetism, but low enough to retain ample Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) at high latitudes for extragalactic and cosmological science. We developed a new scanning strategy based on long azimuth scans, and a corresponding map-making procedure to make recovery of the overall mean signal of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ possible, a long-standing problem with polarization observations. We describe the scanning strategy, map-making procedure, and validation tests. The overall mean signal is recovered with a precision better than 0.5\%. The maps have a mean sensitivity of 0.81 mK on beam--size scales and show clear polarized signals, typically to within a few degrees of the Galactic plane, with ample S/N everywhere (the typical signal in low emission regions is 13 mK, and 98.6\% of the pixels have S/N $> 3$). The largest depolarization areas are in the inner Galaxy, associated with the Sagittarius Arm. We have also computed a Rotation Measure map combining S-PASS with archival data from the WMAP and Planck experiments. A Stokes $I$ map has been generated, with a sensitivity limited to the confusion level of 9 mK."

We develop a novel econometric model which is based on day-ahead wholesale auction curves data and errors in wind and solar power forecasts. The model shifts day-ahead supply curves to calculate intraday prices. We apply our model to the German EPEX SPOT SE data. Our model outperforms both linear and non-linear benchmarks. Our study allows us to conclude that errors in renewable energy forecasts exert a non-linear impact on intraday prices. We demonstrate that additional wind and solar power capacities induce non-linear changes in the intraday price volatility. Finally, we comment on economical and policy implications of our findings."

By combining a fixed-function multi-core SoC with flexible, configurable FPGA fabric, the latter can be used to realize heterogeneous Real-time Systems (RTSs) commonly implementing complex application-specific architectures with high computation and communication (I/O) densities. Their dynamic changes in workload, currently active power saving features and thus power consumption require precise voltage and current sensing on all relevant supply rails to enable dependable evaluation of the various power management techniques. In this paper, we propose a low-cost 18-channel 16-bit-resolution measurement (sub-)system capable of 200 kSPS (kilo-samples per second) for instrumentation of current pSoC development boards. To this end, we join simultaneously sampling analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and analog voltage/current sensing circuitry with a Cortex M7 microcontroller using an SD card for storage. In addition, we propose to include crucial I/O components such as Ethernet PHYs into the power monitoring to gain a holistic view on the RTS's temporal behavior covering not only computation on FPGA and CPUs, but also communication in terms of, e.g., reception of sensor values and transmission of actuation signals. We present an FMC-sized implementation of our measurement system combined with two Gigabit Ethernet PHYs and one HDMI input. Paired with Xilinx' ZC702 development board, we are able to synchronously acquire power traces of a Zynq pSoC and the two PHYs precise enough to identify individual Ethernet frames."

We reveal a controllable degree of localisation, as characterised by the inverse-participation ratio, by tuning the positional disorder of arrays of interacting mesas. This constitutes the realisation of disorder-induced localisation in a driven-dissipative system. In addition to being an ideal candidate for investigating localisation in this regime, microcavity polaritons hold promise for low-power, ultra-small devices and their localisation could be used as a resource in quantum memory and quantum information processing."

Application of controlled uniaxial pressure has recently been shown to more than double the transition temperature of the unconventional superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ for example, leading to a pronounced peak in $T_\mathrm{c}$ vs. strain whose origin is still under active debate. Here, we develop a simple and compact method to apply large uniaxial pressures passively in restricted sample environments, and utilize this to study the evolution of the electronic structure of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ using angle-resolved photoemission. We directly visualize how uniaxial stress drives a Lifshitz transition of the $\gamma$-band Fermi surface, pointing to the key role of strain-tuning its associated van Hove singularity to the Fermi level in mediating the peak in $T_\mathrm{c}$. Our measurements provide stringent constraints for theoretical models of the strain-tuned electronic structure evolution of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. More generally, our novel experimental approach opens the door to future studies of strain-tuned phase transitions not only using photoemission, but also other experimental techniques where large pressure cells or piezoelectric-based devices may be difficult to implement."

A novel perturbation analysis is performed on CUR approximations of noisy versions of low-rank matrices, which compares them with the putative CUR decomposition of the underlying low-rank part.

An essential part of the three-point function estimation is performing triplet counts of synthetic data points in random catalogues. Since triplet counting algorithms scale at best as $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ with the number of particles and the random catalogues are typically at least 50 times denser than the data; this tends to be by far the most time-consuming part of the measurements. Here we present a simple method of computing the necessary triplet counts involving uniform random distributions through simple one-dimensional integrals. The method speeds up the computation of the three-point function by orders of magnitude, eliminating the need for random catalogues, with the simultaneous pair and triplet counting of the data points alone being sufficient."

A fast algorithm of blockwise sinogram filtering is presented for realtime low-dose CT imaging. A nonstationary Gaussian noise model of low-dose sinogram data is proposed in the low-mA (tube current) CT protocol. Then, according to the linear minimum mean square error principle, an adaptive blockwise algorithm is built to filter contaminated sinogram data caused by photon starvation. A moving sum technique is used to speed the algorithm into a linear time one, regardless of the block size and thedata range. The proposedfast filtering givesa better performance in noise reduction and detail preservation in the reconstructed images,which is verified in experiments on simulated and real data compared with some related filtering methods."

However, it tends to be data-inefficient, which is especially costly in robotic learning tasks. On the other hand, optimal control does not require data if the system model is known, but cannot scale to models with high-dimensional states and observations. To exploit benefits of both model-free RL and optimal control, we propose time-to-reach-based (TTR-based) reward shaping, an optimal control-inspired technique to alleviate data inefficiency while retaining advantages of model-free RL. This is achieved by summarizing key system model information using a TTR function to greatly speed up the RL process, as shown in our simulation results. The TTR function is defined as the minimum time required to move from any state to the goal under assumed system dynamics constraints. Since the TTR function is computationally intractable for systems with high-dimensional states, we compute it for approximate, lower-dimensional system models that still captures key dynamic behaviors. Our approach can be flexibly and easily incorporated into any model-free RL algorithm without altering the original algorithm structure, and is compatible with any other techniques that may facilitate the RL process. We evaluate our approach on two representative robotic learning tasks and three well-known model-free RL algorithms, and show significant improvements in data efficiency and performance."

Intrinsic changes of the electronic structure have been successfully observed in the valence band region by the careful consideration of charging effects. The obtained photoemission results have revealed that the intensity of the nearly non-dispersive Cu 3$d$-O 2$p$ hybridized bands at the binding energy of $\sim$2 eV increases with decreasing temperature from 300 to 120 K.

In this paper, we extend the analysis from [1] to the alternative regime in which $M,K\to \infty$ with a given ratio.

The standard DDA formulation involves the uniform discretization of the underlying volume integral equation, leading to a linear system with a block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block matrix. This structure permits a matrix-vector product to be performed with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ complexity via the fast-Fourier transform (FFT). Thus, in principle, the system can be solved rapidly using an iterative method. However, it is well known that the convergence of iterative methods becomes increasing slow as the optical size and refractive index of the scattering obstacle are increased. In this paper, we present a preconditioning strategy based on the multi-level circulant preconditioner of Chan and Olkin and assess its performance for improving this rate of convergence. In particular, we approximate the system matrix by a block-circulant circulant-block matrix which can be inverted rapidly using the FFT. We present numerical results for scattering by hexagonal ice prisms demonstrating that this serves as an effective preconditioning strategy, reducing simulation times by orders of magnitude in many cases.

However, the feedback mechanism, which commonly exists in human visual system, has not been fully exploited in existing deep learning based image SR methods. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution feedback network (SRFBN) to refine low-level representations with high-level information. Specifically, we use hidden states in an RNN with constraints to achieve such feedback manner. A feedback block is designed to handle the feedback connections and to generate powerful high-level representations. The proposed SRFBN comes with a strong early reconstruction ability and can create the final high-resolution image step by step. In addition, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy to make the network well suitable for more complicated tasks, where the low-resolution images are corrupted by multiple types of degradation.

It contains the celebrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a special case that only equivary to the translations. In contrast, we seek to train TERs for a generic class of transformations and train them in an {\em unsupervised} fashion. To this end, we present a novel principled method by Autoencoding Variational Transformations (AVT), compared with the conventional approach to autoencoding data. Formally, given transformed images, the AVT seeks to train the networks by maximizing the mutual information between the transformations and representations. This ensures the resultant TERs of individual images contain the {\em intrinsic} information about their visual structures that would equivary {\em extricably} under various transformations in a generalized {\em nonlinear} case. Technically, we show that the resultant optimization problem can be efficiently solved by maximizing a variational lower-bound of the mutual information. This variational approach introduces a transformation decoder to approximate the intractable posterior of transformations, resulting in an autoencoding architecture with a pair of the representation encoder and the transformation decoder. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AVT model sets a new record for the performances on unsupervised tasks, greatly closing the performance gap to the supervised models."

Assuming functorial resolution of singularities over $\mathbb{Z}$, this implies that the $E_1$-degeneration property depends only on the generic fiber.

While its anticyclonic vortex appearance suggests it might be a shallow weather-layer feature, the very long time span for which it was observed implies it is likely deeply rooted, otherwise it would have been sheared apart by Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. Determining the GRS depth will shed light not only on the processes governing the GRS, but on the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere as a whole. The Juno mission single flyby over the GRS (PJ7) discovered using microwave radiometer measurements that the GRS is at least a couple hundred kilometers deep (Li et al. 2017). The next flybys over the GRS (PJ18 and PJ21), will allow high-precision gravity measurements that can be used to estimate how deep the GRS winds penetrate below the cloud-level. Here we propose a novel method to determine the depth of the GRS based on the new gravity measurements and a Slepian function approach that enables an effective representation of the wind-induced spatially-confined gravity signal, and an efficient determination of the GRS depth given the limited measurements. We show that with this method the gravity signal of the GRS should be detectable for wind depths deeper than 300 kilometers, with reasonable uncertainties that depend on depth (e.g., $\pm$100km for a GRS depth of 1000km)."

Due to the location of these BHs within the cluster, large-scale cluster processes may aid the growth of BHs in BCGs. In this work, we study a sample of 71 galaxy clusters to explore the relationship between the BH mass, stellar bulge mass of the BCG, and the total gravitating mass of the host clusters. Due to difficulties in obtaining dynamically measured BH masses in distant galaxies, we use the Fundamental Plane relationship of BHs to infer their masses. We utilize X-ray observations taken by $Chandra$ to measure the temperature of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), which is a proxy for the total mass of the cluster. We analyze the $\rm M_{BH}-kT$ and $\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships and establish the best-fitting power laws:$\log_{10}(M_{\rm BH} /10^9 M_{\odot})=-0.35+2.08 \log_{10}(kT / 1 \rm keV)$ and $\log_{10}(\rm M_{BH}/10^9M_{\odot})= -1.09+ 1.92 \log_{10}(M_{\rm bulge}/10^{11}M_{\odot})$. Both relations are comparable with that established earlier for a sample of brightest group/cluster galaxies with dynamically measured BH masses. Although both the $\rm M_{BH}-kT$ and the $\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships exhibit large intrinsic scatter, based on Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that dominant fraction of the scatter originates from the Fundamental Plane relationship. We split the sample into cool core and non-cool core resembling clusters, but do not find statistically significant differences in the $\rm M_{BH}-kT$ relation. We speculate that the overly massive BHs in BCGs may be due to frequent mergers and cool gas inflows onto the cluster center."

In this paper, we focus on the resource allocation for NOMA-based systems and we investigate how Machine Type Devices (MTDs) can be arranged into clusters. Specifically , we propose three allocation technique to enable the integration of massive NOMA-based MTD in the 5G. Firstly, we propose a low-complexity schema where the BS assigns an MTD to a cluster based on its CSI and transmit power in order to ensure that the SIC can be performed in the uplink as well as the downlink. In the second framework, we propose a federated-learning based traffic model estimation in order to extend the capacity of the system. In fact, the BS take into account the traffic model of the MTDs in order to use time multiplexing in addition to the power multiplexing to separate MTDs. After the BS allocation, we propose a learning algorithm to allow contending MTDs synchronize their transmissions. Finally, we focus on the Quality of Service (QoS) for NOMA based devices and we propose in the third framework a QoS-aware technique, where MTDs are served differently based on their mode, i.e. regular or alarm modes. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperform existing technique in the literature."

In the mean-field approximation we obtain a non-linear integro-differential equation with respect to the mean-field electrostatic potential, generalizing the PBL equation for the point-like dipoles obtained first by Abrashkin et al. We apply the obtained equation in its linearized form to derivation of the expressions for the mean-field electrostatic potential of the point-like test ion and its solvation free energy in salt-free solution, as well as in solution with salt ions. For the 'Yukawa'-type PDF we obtain analytic relations for both the electrostatic potential and the solvation free energy of the point-like test ion. We obtain a general expression for the bulk electrostatic free energy of the solution within the random phase approximation (RPA). For the salt-free solution of the dipolar particles for the Yukawa-type PDF we obtain an analytic relation for the electrostatic free energy."

We determine the electronic structure for all first row TM elements in the stable honeycomb configuration between two layers of graphene using density functional theory (DFT). Through an analysis of the electron density, we assess the induction of the magnetic moment in each case, where a comparison of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations allow us to ascertain an estimated exchange coupling between the transition-metal elements. By analyzing the electronic properties, we find that the carbon $p$-bands are degenerate with the TM $d$-bands and form an electron pocket below the Fermi energy at the $\Gamma-$point. These hybridized bands are analogous to the carbon $p$-band effect that produces superconductivity in intercalated graphite with alkali and alkaline-earth metals. Furthermore, since the bands are hybridized with the TM $d$-bands, their magnetic properties may provide bosonic modes from their spin-coupling to preserve the unique linear dispersion present in monolayer graphene. This study provides a designing route by using TMs for tuning magneto-electric Dirac materials and will encourage future experimental studies to further the fundamental knowledge of unconventional superconductivity."

Our supernova feedback induced star formation model along with Sheth-Tormman halo mass function correctly reproduces the shape, amplitude and the redshift evolution of UV and Lyman-{\alpha} luminosity functions of LAEs in the redshift range z = 2 to 7.3. We show that the fraction of Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxies increases with increasing redshifts reaching to unity just after the reionisation. However, we show that star formation efficiency in those LAEs does not show any redshift evolution within the uncertainty in available observations. This would have significant repercussion on the reionisation of the intergalactic medium."

The predicted hidden-bottom tetraquark masses can be confronted to the experimental data in the future to diagnose the nature of the $Z_b$ states.

Anomaly freedom of QFD demands extension of the fermion sector of SM by three sterile right-handed neutrino fields. Poles of fermion propagators with chirality-changing self-energies $\Sigma(p^2)$ spontaneously generated by QFD at strong coupling define: (1) Three sterile-neutrino Majorana masses $M_{fR}$ of order $\Lambda$. (2) Three Dirac masses $m_f$, degenerate for $e_f, \nu_f, u_f, d_f$ in family $f$, exponentially small with respect to $\Lambda$. Goldstone theorem implies: All eight flavor gluons acquire masses of order $M_{fR}$. $W$ and $Z$ bosons acquire masses of order $\sum m_f$, the effective Fermi scale. Composite 'would-be' Nambu-Goldstone bosons have their 'genuine' partners, the composite Higgs particles: The SM-like Higgs $h$ and two new Higgses $h_3$ and $h_8$, all with masses at Fermi scale; three Higgses $\chi_i$ with masses at scale $\Lambda$. Large pole-mass splitting of charged leptons and quarks in $f$ is arguably due to full QED $\Sigma(p^2)$-dependent fermion-photon vertices enforced by Ward-Takahashi identities. The argument relies on illustrative computation of pole-mass splitting found non-analytic in fermion electric charges. Neutrinos are the Majorana particles with seesaw mass spectrum computed solely by QFD. Available data fix $\Lambda$ to, say, $\Lambda \sim 10^{14} \rm GeV$."

Firstly, POD provides an optimally ordered basis from a set of selected full-order snapshots. Truncating this optimal basis, we construct a reduced-order model with undetermined coefficients. Then, PCE is utilized to approximate the coefficients of the truncated basis. In the proposed method, we construct a PCE using a non-intrusive regression-based method. Combined with the model reduction ability of POD, the proposed method efficiently provides stochastic representations in UQ analysis. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, we provide three numerical examples, i.e., a highly nonlinear analytical function with three uncertain parameters, two-dimensional (2D) heat-driven cavity flow with a stochastic boundary temperature, and 2D heat diffusion with stochastic conductivity. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the computational costs and storage requirements that arise due to high-dimensional physical and random spaces. While demonstrating a similar accuracy with that of the classical full-PCE in predicting statistical quantities. Furthermore, the proposed method reasonably predict the outputs of the full order model using only a few snapshots."

The formula is derived via a generalisation of the Kalantarov-Zeitlin method, which showed that the calculation of mutual inductance between a circular primary filament and any other secondary filament having an arbitrary shape and any desired position with respect to the primary filament is reduced to a line integral. In particular, the obtained formula provides a solution for the singularity issue arising in the Grover and Babic formulas for the case when the planes of the primary and secondary circular filaments are mutually perpendicular. The efficiency and flexibility of the Kalantarov-Zeitlin method allow us to extend immediately the application of the obtained result to a case of the calculation of the mutual inductance between a primary circular filament and its projection on a tilted plane. Newly developed formulas have been successfully validated through a number of examples available in the literature, and by a direct comparison with the results of calculation performed by the FastHenry software."

We use polynomials and multiscale basis to form the coarse mortar space. The multiscale basis is the restriction of global pressure field obtained at previous time step on the coarse interface. We solve the pressure equation on the fine grid to initialize the simulation. Numerical experiments on some benchmark 2D and 3D heterogeneous models are provided to validate the performance of our method."

In this paper, under suitable assumptions, we produce a projective bundle over the product of the moduli spaces of semistable vector bundles of rank $r$ on each components and we show that it is birational to an irreducible component of $\mathcal{U}_C(r,w,\chi)$. Then we prove the rationality of the closed subset containing vector bundles with given fixed determinant."

However, as the eavesdropper is located in the direction pointed by the mainlobe of the information-carrying beam, information leakage is inevitable and FAB cannot guarantee PLS performance. To address this threat, we propose a novel fixed region beamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray (FDSA) architecture to enhance the PLS performance for mmWave directional communications. In particular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs) across subarrays to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures a confined information transmission only within the desired angle-range region (DARR) in close vicinity of the target user. More specifically, we formulate the secrecy rate maximization problem with FRB over possible subarray FOIs, and consider two cases of interests, i.e., without/with the location information of eavesdropping, both turn out to be NP-hard. For the unknown eavesdropping location case, we propose a seeker optimization algorithm to minimize the maximum sidelobe peak of the beampattern outside the DARR. As for the known eavesdropping location case, a block coordinate descend linear approximation algorithm is proposed to minimize the sidelobe level in the eavesdropping region. By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes of all subarrays are constructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively overlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB takes prominent effect on confining information transmission within the DARR. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDSA-based FRB can provide superior PLS performance over the CPA-based FAB."

In unsteady vector field analysis, researchers recently directed their attention towards the computation of near-steady reference frames for vortex extraction, which is a numerically challenging endeavor. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end-to-end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization-based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning-based feature extraction. Based on Vatistas velocity profile, we formulate a parametric vector field mixture model that we parameterize based on numerically-computed example vector fields in near-steady reference frames. Given the parametric model, we can efficiently synthesize thousands of vector fields that serve as input to our deep learning architecture. The proposed network is evaluated on an unseen numerical fluid flow simulation."

We first train a PruningNet, a kind of meta network, which is able to generate weight parameters for any pruned structure given the target network. We use a simple stochastic structure sampling method for training the PruningNet. Then, we apply an evolutionary procedure to search for good-performing pruned networks. The search is highly efficient because the weights are directly generated by the trained PruningNet and we do not need any finetuning at search time. With a single PruningNet trained for the target network, we can search for various Pruned Networks under different constraints with little human participation. Compared to the state-of-the-art pruning methods, we have demonstrated superior performances on MobileNet V1/V2 and ResNet. Codes are available on https://github.com/liuzechun/MetaPruning."

The goal is to understand {\em neuromorphic} feedback control in which streams of data come from large arrays of sensors (e.g. photo-receptors in the eye) and actuation requires coordination of large numbers of actuators (e.g. motor neurons). The context for this work is set by consideration of a stylized problem of robot navigation that uses optical flow as sensed by two idealized and precise photoreceptors. A robust steering law in this setting establishes a foundation for exploiting optical flow based on averaged noisy inputs from large numbers of imprecise sensing elements. Seeking inspiration in neurobiology, the challenges of actuator and sensor intermittency are discussed as are learning actuator coordination strategies. It is shown that there are advantages to having large numbers of control inputs and outputs. The results will be shown to make contact with ideas from control communication complexity and the standard parts problem."

For instance, the encapsulation of graphene or MoS2 between atomically flat hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers with strong affinity and graphitic gates that screen charge impurity disorder provided access to a plethora of interesting physical phenomena by drastically boosting the device quality. The encapsulation is accompanied by a self-cleansing effect at the interfaces. The otherwise predominant charged impurity disorder is minimized and random strain fluctuations ultimately constitute the main source of residual disorder. Despite these advances, the fabricated heterostructures still vary notably in their performance. While some achieve record mobilities, others only possess mediocre quality. Here, we report a reliable method to improve fully completed van der Waals heterostructure devices with a straightforward post-processing surface treatment based on thermal annealing and contact mode AFM. The impact is demonstrated by comparing magnetotransport measurements before and after the AFM treatment on one and the same device as well as on a larger set of treated and untreated devices to collect device statistics. Both the low temperature properties as well as the room temperature electrical characteristics, as relevant for applications, improve on average substantially. We surmise that the main beneficial effect arises from reducing nanometer scale corrugations at the interfaces, i.e. the detrimental impact of random strain fluctuations."

It is often interpreted causally as proportion of preventable cases after an elimination of exposure. Originally, the PAF has been defined for cohort studies of fixed length with a baseline exposure or cross-sectional studies.   An extension of the definition to complex time-to-event data is not straightforward. We revise the proposed approaches in literature and provide a clear concept of the PAF for these data situations. The conceptualization is achieved by a proper differentiation between estimands and estimators as well as causal effect measures and measures of association."

Once they are formed and through their descent towards the surface, these nanoparticles are submitted to persistent Far Ultra-Violet (FUV) radiation that can reach lower atmospheric layers. Such an interaction has an impact, especially on the chemistry and charge budget of the atmospheric compounds. Models are useful to understand this photoprocessing, but they lack important input data such as the photoemission threshold or the absolute photoabsorption/emission cross sections of the aerosols. In order to quantify the photoemission processes, analogs of Titan s aerosols have been studied with the DESIRS FUV beamline at the synchrotron SOLEIL as isolated substrate-free nanoparticles. We present here the corresponding ARPES (Angle-Resolved PhotoElectron Spectroscopy) data recorded at different FUV photon energies. The results show a very low photoionization threshold (6.0 +/- 0.1 eV~ 207 nm) and very high absolute ionization cross sections (~106 Mb) indicating that FUV photoemission from aerosols is an intense source of slow electrons which has to be taken into account in photochemical models of Titan s atmosphere."

We show how the theory captures the onset of material spike formation, without any assumption on the flow type (steady, periodic, unsteady) or separation type (on- or off-wall, fixed or moving boundaries). We uncover new phenomena, such as the transition from on-wall to off-wall separation, the merger of initially distinct spikes, and the presence of severe material spikes that remain hidden to previous approaches. These results unveil how an involved network of spikes arises, interacts, and merges dynamically, leading to the final ejection of particles from the wall in highly transient flow separation processes."

Starting from a classical Schwarzschild black hole, the backreaction effects produced by the running Newton's coupling are taken into account iteratively. The sequence, described by a simple recurrence relation, flows towards a self-consistent solution that can be derived analytically. As a key result, if the gravitational renormalization group flow attains a non-trivial fixed point at high energies, the sequence converges to a ""renormalized"" black-hole spacetime of the Dymnikova-type, which is free of singularities."

Colour shift keying (CSK) is a well-researched IEEE standardised multi-colour VLC modulation technique. This paper presents an investigation into the performance of tri-chromatic LED (TLED) CSK standardised in IEEE 802.15.7 and a quad-chromatic LED (QLED) CSK, over a range of diffuse optical wireless channels, and proposes the use of frequency domain equalisation (FDE) at the receiver to combat multipath dispersion. The investigation results show that the FDE enables the higher order CSK modulation modes to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of 10\textsuperscript{-6} for finite amounts of optical power while operating over highly dispersive channels and hence provide data links of up to 85.33 and 256 Mbit/s through TLED and QLED CSK, respectively, for a system bandwidth of 24 MHz. The overall optical power requirements of the CSK schemes can be reduce by up to 12.6 dB with the use of FDE at the cost of a small overhead due to cyclic prefix. The optical channel model used in this investigation includes the cross-talk and insertion losses caused by the optical properties of commercially available system front end devices."

BGDY is a particularly attractive candidate for this purpose due to uniformly distributed pores which can bind the light-metal atoms. Our DFTcalculations reveal that BGDY can accommodate multiple light-metal dopants (Li, Na, K, Ca)with significantly high binding energies. The stabilities of metal functionalized BGDY monolayers have been confirmed through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, significant charge-transfer between the dopantsand BGDY sheet renders the metal with a significant positive charge, which is a prerequisite for adsorbing hydrogen (H2) molecules with appropriate binding energies.This results in exceptionally high H2 storage capacities of 14.29, 11.11, 9.10 and 8.99 wt% for the Li, Na, K and Ca dopants, respectively. These H2storage capacities are much higher than many 2D materials such as graphene, graphane, graphdiyne, graphyne, C2N, silicene, and phosphorene. Average H2 adsorption energies for all the studied systems fall within an ideal window of 0.17-0.40 eV/H2. We have also performed thermodynamic analysis to study the adsorption/desorption behavior of H2, which confirmsthat desorption of the H2molecules occurs at practical conditions of pressure and temperature."

We discuss resolving this tension within an extension of the SM that includes a flavour violating $Z'$ that couples only to $\bar{s}s$ and $\bar{c}u$. We show that for masses below 80 GeV and flavour violating coupling of the order of $10^{-4}$, this model can successfully resolve the tension and avoid constraints from dijet searches, $D^0-\overline{D}^0$ mixing and measurements of the $Z$ width."

We focus on the growth of commutators of operators at a temperature $T$ above the zero temperature quantum critical point separating the spin-glass and paramagnetic phases. In the large $N,~M$ limit, the squared commutators of the rotor fields do not display any exponential growth of commutators, in spite of the absence of any sharp quasiparticle-like excitations in the disorder-averaged theory. We show that in this limit, the problem is integrable and point out interesting connections to random-matrix theory. At leading order in $1/M$, there are no modifications to the critical behavior but an irrelevant term in the fixed-point action leads to a small exponential growth of the squared commutator. We also introduce and comment on a generalized model involving $p$-pair rotor interactions."

By testing geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens a notable structure size effect on the nominal strength of DFCs is identified. As the specimen size increases, the nominal strength decreases. For small specimens, we find a limited size effect with enhanced pseudo-ductility and a strong divergence from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). For sufficiently large specimen sizes, the scaling of the nominal strength follows closely LEFM with a strong brittle failure. As the thickness increases, the size effect decreases.   We identify the fracture energy and the effective size of the fracture process zone as a function of the thickness of the structure. To do so, we integrate equivalent fracture mechanics and stochastic finite element modeling. Experimentally, we collect the nominal strength of geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens. The numerical stochastic model captures the complex, inhomogeneous mesostructure of DFCs by explicitly generating the platelets. From the integrated analysis, it is found that the fracture energy depends significantly on the structure thickness. It is shown to increase gradually up to 2 mm and saturates after 3 mm to a value of 57.77 N/mm, which is 4.81 times larger than a typical aluminum alloy."

If correct, it would be the second colliding wind binary detected in GeV gamma-rays. However, the reported flux measurements from 1.4 to 8.64GHz fail to establish the presence of non-thermal (synchrotron) emission from this source. Moreover, WR11 is not the only radio source within the Fermi detection box. Other possible counterparts have been identified in archival data, some of which present strong non-thermal radio emission. We conducted ""-resolution observations towards WR11 at very low frequencies (150 to 1400~MHz) where the NT emission is expected to dominate, and present a catalog of more than 400 radio-emitters, among which a significant part is detected at more than one frequency, including limited spectral index information. A search for counterparts for this last group pointed at MOST0808-471, a source 2' away from WR11, as a promising candidate for high-energy emission, with resolved structure along 325 - 1390 MHz. For it, we reprocessed archive interferometric data up to 22.3 GHz and obtained a non-thermal radio spectral index of -0.97 +- 0.09. However, multiwavelength observations of this source are required to establish its nature and to assess whether it can produce (part of) the observed gamma-rays. WR11 spectrum follows a spectral index of 0.74 +- 0.03 from 150 to 230 GHz, consistent with thermal emission. We interpret that any putative synchrotron radiation from the colliding-wind region of this relatively short-period system is absorbed in the photospheres of the individual components.

The bulk spinor is coupled to scalar field of the brane by a nonminimal Yukawa term compatible with the scenario's geometry. We show that, independently of wall's thickness, only one massless chiral mode is localized on the wall. The massive chiral modes follow a Schr\""odinger equation, whose potential has a mass gap determined by Yukawa constant, which is a generic property of this system. The fermions spectrum is defined bellow the gap, by bound states of both chiralities with the same mass, and above the gap, by a continuous spectrum with local and global resonant modes of both chiralities and different mass."

Even when the boundaries start out aligned, they typically become misaligned through hydrodynamic motion. There are usually a number of methods for handling multimaterial cells in any given hydro code. One of the simplest methods is to replace the multimaterial cell by an average single-material cell whose heat capacity and conductivity are averages over the constituent materials. One can further refine this model by using either the arithmetic or harmonic averages, thereby providing two distinct (albeit naive) multimaterial models for the arithmetic and harmonic averages. More sophisticated models typically involve a surrogate mesh of some kind, as with the thin mesh and static condensation methods. In this paper, we perform rigorous code verification of the multiphysics hydrocode FLAG, including grid resolution studies. We employ a number of newly constructed 2D heat flow solutions that generalize the standard {\em planar sandwich} solution, and this paper offers a smorgasbord of exact solutions for heat flow verification. To perform the analyses and to produce the corresponding convergence plots, we employ the code verification tool ExactPack."

While several approaches for the problem have been proposed, the best-performing ones tend to require extremely detailed input representations (eg. image sequences). But, such methods do not generalize to datasets they have not been trained on. We propose intermediate representations that are particularly well-suited for future prediction. As opposed to using texture (color) information, we rely on semantics and train an autoregressive model to accurately predict future trajectories of traffic participants (vehicles) (see fig. above). We demonstrate that using semantics provides a significant boost over techniques that operate over raw pixel intensities/disparities. Uncharacteristic of state-of-the-art approaches, our representations and models generalize to completely different datasets, collected across several cities, and also across countries where people drive on opposite sides of the road (left-handed vs right-handed driving). Additionally, we demonstrate an application of our approach in multi-object tracking (data association). To foster further research in transferrable representations and ensure reproducibility, we release all our code and data."

However, getting large scale image-caption paired data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a scene graph-based approach for unpaired image captioning. Our framework comprises an image scene graph generator, a sentence scene graph generator, a scene graph encoder, and a sentence decoder. Specifically, we first train the scene graph encoder and the sentence decoder on the text modality. To align the scene graphs between images and sentences, we propose an unsupervised feature alignment method that maps the scene graph features from the image to the sentence modality. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generate quite promising results without using any image-caption training pairs, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin."

It is the key instrument meant to address the top-level science question: How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? SO/PHI will also play an important role in answering the other top-level science questions of Solar Orbiter, as well as hosting the potential of a rich return in further science.   SO/PHI measures the Zeeman effect and the Doppler shift in the FeI 617.3nm spectral line. To this end, the instrument carries out narrow-band imaging spectro-polarimetry using a tunable LiNbO_3 Fabry-Perot etalon, while the polarisation modulation is done with liquid crystal variable retarders (LCVRs). The line and the nearby continuum are sampled at six wavelength points and the data are recorded by a 2kx2k CMOS detector. To save valuable telemetry, the raw data are reduced on board, including being inverted under the assumption of a Milne-Eddington atmosphere, although simpler reduction methods are also available on board. SO/PHI is composed of two telescopes; one, the Full Disc Telescope (FDT), covers the full solar disc at all phases of the orbit, while the other, the High Resolution Telescope (HRT), can resolve structures as small as 200km on the Sun at closest perihelion. The high heat load generated through proximity to the Sun is greatly reduced by the multilayer-coated entrance windows to the two telescopes that allow less than 4% of the total sunlight to enter the instrument, most of it in a narrow wavelength band around the chosen spectral line."

Most efforts considering energy issues in scheduling problems have focused on static scheduling. But in fact, scheduling problems are dynamic in the real world with uncertain new arrival jobs after the execution time. This paper proposes a dynamic energy efficient flexible flow shop scheduling model using peak power value with the consideration of new arrival jobs. As the problem is strongly NP-hard, a priority based hybrid parallel Genetic Algorithm with a predictive reactive complete rescheduling approach is developed. In order to achieve a speedup to meet the short response in the dynamic environment, the proposed method is designed to be highly consistent with NVIDIA CUDA software model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted and show that our approach can not only achieve better performance than the traditional static approach, but also gain competitive results by reducing the time requirements dramatically."

Most studies in this area focused on highly active objects, those with small perihelion distances or examples of objects with peculiar physical properties and/or unusual chemical compositions. This may have produced a biased sample of Oort cloud comets in which the most common objects may be rare, particularly those with perihelia well beyond the orbit of the Earth. Within this context, the known Oort cloud comets may not be representative of the full sample. Here, we study the spectral properties in the visible region and the cometary activity of Comet C/2018 F4 (PANSTARRS). We also explore its orbital evolution with the aim of understanding its origin within the context of known minor bodies moving along nearly parabolic or hyperbolic paths. We present observations obtained with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), derive the spectral class and visible slope of C/2018 F4 and characterise its level of cometary activity. Direct N-body simulations are carried out to explore its orbital evolution. The absolute magnitude of C/2018 F4 is Hr=13.62+/-0.04. Assuming a pV=0.04 its diameter is D<10.4 km. The object presents a conspicuous coma, with a level of activity comparable to those of other comets observed at similar heliocentric distances. Comet C/2018 F4 has a visible spectrum consistent with that of an X-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope S'=4.0+/-1.0 %/1000\AA and no evidence of hydration. The spectrum matches those of well-studied primitive asteroids and comets. The analysis of its dynamical evolution prior to discovery suggests that C/2018 F4 is not of extrasolar origin. Although the present-day heliocentric orbit of C/2018 F4 is slightly hyperbolic, its observational properties and past orbital evolution are consistent with those of a dynamically old comet with an origin in the Oort cloud."

In recent years, Conditional Variational Auto Encoders (CVAE) have shown promising performances for this task. However, they often encounter the so called KL-Vanishing problem. Previous works mitigated such problem by heuristic methods such as strengthening the encoder or weakening the decoder while optimizing the CVAE objective function. Nevertheless, the optimizing direction of these methods are implicit and it is hard to find an appropriate degree to which these methods should be applied. In this paper, we propose an explicit optimizing objective to complement the CVAE to directly pull away from KL-vanishing. In fact, this objective term guides the encoder towards the ""best encoder"" of the decoder to enhance the expressiveness. A labeling network is introduced to estimate the ""best encoder"". It provides a continuous label in the latent space of CVAE to help build a close connection between latent variables and targets. The whole proposed method is named Self Labeling CVAE~(SLCVAE). To accelerate the research of diverse text generation, we also propose a large native one-to-many dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted on two tasks, which show that our method largely improves the generating diversity while achieving comparable accuracy compared with state-of-art algorithms."

We explore generic coupled scalar field theories, with the symmetron model as an explicit example. We find that theories which attempt to eliminate dark matter by using flat rotation curves produce mass estimates in the timing argument which are not compatible with the luminous mass of the galaxies alone. Assuming that the galaxies are on a first pass, MOND gives of around $2.7\times 10^{10} M_\odot$, roughly 10\% of the luminous mass of the LG, although a higher mass can be obtained in the case of a previous fly-by event between the MW and M31. The symmetron model suggests a mass too high to be explained without additional dark matter ($\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) M_\odot$). We also demonstrate that tensions in measurements of $H_0$ can produce an uncertainty in the Local Group mass estimate comparable to observational uncertainties on the separation and relative velocity of the galaxies, with values for the mass ranging from $4.5 - 5.4 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ varying $h$ between 0.67 and 0.76."

On the type-II WSM side, i.e., inside the {ES when $v_{\parallel}$ is large}, the motion of the quasiparticles may be chaotic {after} a critical surface as they are governed by an effective inverted oscillator potential induced by the mismatch between the type-I and type-II Weyl nodes.

The resulting system is evaluated using the datasets from the German dialect identification and Indo-Aryan language identification shared tasks of the VarDial workshops 2017 and 2018. The new approach with language identification provides considerably higher F1-scores than the previous HeLI method or the other systems which participated in the shared tasks. The results indicate that unsupervised language model adaptation should be considered as an option in all language identification tasks, especially in those where encountering out-of-domain data is likely."

We study the large-scale inhomogeneities in such interacting scenarios and we confront them with the latest astronomical data. Our analysis shows that the sign-changeable interaction models are able to produce stable perturbations. Additionally, the data seem to slightly favor a non-zero interaction, however, within $1\sigma$ confidence level (CL) the scenarios cannot be distinguished from non-interacting cosmologies. We find that the best-fit value of the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter lies in the phantom regime, while the quintessence region is also allowed nevertheless at more than 2$\sigma$ CL. Examining the effect of the interaction on the CMB TT and matter power spectra we show that while from the simple spectra it is hard to distinguish the interacting case from $\Lambda$CDM scenario, in the residual graphs the interaction is indeed traceable. Moreover, we find that sign-changeable interaction models can reconcile the $H_0$ tension, however the $\sigma_8$ tension is still persisting. Finally, we examine the validity of the laws of thermodynamics and we show that the generalized second law is always satisfied, while the second derivative of the total entropy becomes negative at late times which implies that the universe tends towards thermodynamic equilibrium."

It is shown that during four years of the survey program about 300 bursts are expected to appear in the field of view of eROSITA. About 1\% of them will be detected by ground-based radio telescopes. For a total energy release $\sim~10^{46}$~ergs depending on the spectral parameters and absorption in the interstellar and intergalactic media, an X-ray flare can be detected from distances from $\sim 1$~Mpc (thermal spectrum with $kT=200$~keV and strong absorption) up to $\sim1$~Gpc (power-law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma=2 $ and realistic absorption). Thus, eROSITA observations might help to provide important constraints on parameters of sources of fast radio bursts, or may even allow to identify the X-ray transient counterparts, which will help to constrain models of fast radio bursts generation."

Therefore, the incremental learning capability is a critical feature for a robust and personalized object detection system that many applications would rely on. In this paper, we present an efficient yet practical system, RILOD, to incrementally train an existing object detection model such that it can detect new object classes without losing its capability to detect old classes. The key component of RILOD is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage deep object detection models only using training data of new object classes. Specifically to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding box annotations. We have implemented RILOD under both edge-cloud and edge-only setups. Experiment results show that the proposed system can learn to detect a new object class in just a few minutes, including both dataset construction and model training. In comparison, traditional fine-tuning based method may take a few hours for training, and in most cases would also need a tedious and costly manual dataset labeling step."

Each distance estimate supports a different structure for the outer arm. Moreover, given its large Galactocentric radii, S269 has special relevance as its proper motion and parallax have been used to constrain the Galactic rotation curve at large radii. Using recent Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations, we accurately measure the parallax and proper motion of the water masers in S269. We interpret the position and motion of S269 in the context of Galactic structure, and possible optical counterparts. S269's 22 GHz water masers and two close-by quasars were observed at 16 epochs between 2015 and 2016 using the VLBA. We measure an annual parallax for S269 of 0.241 $\pm$ 0.012 mas corresponding to a distance from the Sun of $4.15^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$ kpc by fitting four maser spots. The mean proper motion for S269 was estimated as $0.16\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $-0.51\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ for $\mu_{\alpha} \ cos \delta$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ respectively, which corresponds to the motion expected for a flat Galactic rotation curve at large radius. This distance estimate, Galactic kinematic simulations and observations of other massive young stars in the outer region support the existence of a kink in the outer arm at $l \approx$ 140 degrees. Additionally, we find more than 2,000 optical sources in the Gaia DR2 catalog within 125 pc radius around the 3D position of the water maser emission; from those only three sources are likely members of the same stellar association that contains the young massive star responsible for the maser emission (S269 IRS 2w)."

We initially assume fluorescent emission from cold photo-ionized gas confined by the pressure of a hot halo. Acceptable CGM baryon fractions (equal or smaller than the cosmological value) require that the cold gas occupies $\lesssim$ 1% of the volume, but is about as massive as the hot gas. CGM baryon fractions as low as 30% of the cosmic value, as predicted by some strongly ejective feedback models at this redshift, are not easy to reconcile with observations, under our assumptions, unless both the QSO-hosting haloes at $z\sim3$ are more massive than recent BOSS estimates based on clustering and the photo-ionized gas is colder than expected in a standard QSO ionizing radiation field. We also consider the option that the emission is dominated by photons scattered from the QSO broad line region. In this scenario, a very stringent lower limit to the baryon fraction can be obtained under the extreme assumption of optically thin scattering. We infer in this case a baryon fraction of at least 70% of the cosmic value, for fiducial parameters. Lower values require halo masses or gas temperatures different than expected, or that some mechanism keeps the cold gas systematically over-pressured with respect to the ambient medium."

More precisely, given a suitable subset $L$ of the asymptotic boundary of $N$ and a suitable function $H$ on $N$, we are able to construct a set of locally finite perimeter whose boundary has generalized mean curvature $H$ provided that $N$ satisfies the so-called strict convexity condition and that its sectional curvatures are bounded from above by a negative constant.

We performed a detailed photometric analysis of the extremely dense core of the cluster using a set of images secured with the Advanced Camera for Survey in the High Resolution Channel mode on-board the Hubble Space Telescope. The proper combination of the large number of single frames in the near-UV (F220W), and blue (F435W) filters allowed us to perform a superb modeling of the Point Spread Function and an accurate deblending procedure. The Color-Magnitude diagram revealed the presence of two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers. In particular, the blue BSS sequence is characterized by the intriguing presence of two different branches. The first branch appears extremely narrow, it extends up to 2.5 magnitudes brighter than the cluster main-sequence turnoff (MS-TO) point, and it is nicely reproduced by a 2 Gyr-old collisional isochrone. The second branch extends up to 1.5 magnitudes from the MS-TO and it is reproduced by a 5.5 Gyr-old collisional isochrone. Our observations suggest that each of these branches is mainly constituted by a population of nearly coeval collisional BSS of different masses generated during two episodes of high collisional activity. We discuss the possibility that the oldest episode corresponds to the core-collapse event (occurred about 5.5 Gyr ago), while the most recent one (occurred about 2 Gyr ago) is associated with a core oscillation in the post-core collapse evolution. The discovery of these features provides further strong evidence in support of the connection between the BSS properties and GC dynamical evolution, and it opens new perspectives on the study of core-collapse and post core-collapse evolution."

Stoll [5, Theorem 3.2] proved that the space $F^p$ with the topology given by the family of seminorms $\left\{\Vert \cdot\Vert_{q,c}\right\}_{c>0}$ defined for $f\in F^q$ as $\Vert f\Vert_{q,c}:=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\vert a_n\vert\exp\left(-cn^{1/(q+1)} \right)<\infty$, becomes a countably normed Fr\'{e}chet algebra. It is known that for every $p>1$, $F^p$ is the Fr\'{e}chet envelope of the Privalov space $N^p$. In this paper, we extend our study of [32] on the structure of maximal ideals in the algebras $F^p$ ($1<p<\infty$). Namely, the obtained characterization of closed maximal ideals in $F^p$ from [32] is extended here in terms of topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of $\Bbb D$."

A formula that has been frequently cited over many years turns out to have only a limited range of validity, more narrow than for a formula derived using the Born approximation. In an attempt to find a more widely valid simple formula, a soft photon theorem is employed, which in this context implies that the differential rate of photon emission in an electron-ion collision with definite initial and final electron momenta is correctly given for sufficiently soft photons by the Born approximation, to all orders in the Coulomb potential. Corrections to the Born approximation arise because the upper limit on photon energy for this theorem to apply to a given collision becomes increasingly stringent as the scattering approaches the forward direction. A general formula is suggested that takes this into account."

However, the models obtained in other similar tasks, such as pedestrian collision risk analysis and human-robot interaction, are very difficult to generalize to the aerial filming task, because of the difference in data distributions. Towards improving generalization with less amount of labeled data, this paper presents a semi-supervised algorithm for heading direction estimation problem. We utilize temporal continuity as the unsupervised signal to regularize the model and achieve better generalization ability. This semi-supervised algorithm is applied to both training and testing phases, which increases the testing performance by a large margin. We show that by leveraging unlabeled sequences, the amount of labeled data required can be significantly reduced. We also discuss several important details on improving the performance by balancing labeled and unlabeled loss, and making good combinations. Experimental results show that our approach robustly outputs the heading direction for different types of actor. The aesthetic value of the video is also improved in the aerial filming task."

Such a modification is feasible provided only a nearly optimal fidelity is sought. We propose to select the lower bounds of the nearly optimal fidelity values such that their deviations from unit fidelity are less than the minimum error probability characterizing the optimum ambiguous discrimination scheme between the two nonorthogonal quantum states yielding the chosen nearly optimal fidelity values. Departing from the working assumptions of perfect state overlap and uniform distribution of the target state on the unit sphere in N-dimensional complex Hilbert space, we determine that the modified algorithm can indeed outperform the original analog counterpart of a quantum search algorithm. This performance enhancement occurs in terms of speed for a convenient choice of both the ratio E'/E between the energy eigenvalues E' and E of the modified search Hamiltonian and the quantum mechanical overlap x between the source and the target states. Finally, we briefly discuss possible analytical improvements of our investigation together with its potential relevance in practical quantum engineering applications."

A 1974 question of Birman asks for a description of the image; in this paper we give a ""strong approximation"" to the answer. Since a 1984 paper of Squier it has been known that the Burau representation preserves a certain Hermitian form. We show that the Burau image is dense in this unitary group relative to a topology induced by a naturally-occurring filtration. We expect that the methods of the paper should extend to many other representations of the braid group and perhaps ultimately inform the study of knot and link polynomials."

These two approaches are based on the recently developed regularized orbital-optimized M{\o}ller-Plesset method ($\kappa$-OOMP2). The first approach is to combine the Yamaguchi's approximate projection (AP) scheme and $\kappa$-OOMP2 with unrestricted (U) orbitals ($\kappa$-UOOMP2). By capturing only essential symmetry breaking, $\kappa$-UOOMP2 can serve as a suitable basis for AP. The second approach is $\kappa$-OOMP2 with complex, restricted (cR) orbitals ($\kappa$-cROOMP2). Though its applicability is more limited due to the comparative rarity of cR solutions, $\kappa$-cROOMP2 offers a simple framework for describing singlet biradicaloids with complex polarization while removing artificial spatial symmetry breaking. We compare the scope of these two methods with numerical studies. We show that AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 and $\kappa$-cROOMP2 can perform similarly well in the TS12 set, a data set that includes 12 data points for triplet-singlet gaps of several atoms and diatomic molecules with a triplet ground state. This was also found to be true for the barrier height of a reaction involving attack on a cysteine ion by a singlet oxygen molecule. However, we also demonstrate that in highly symmetric systems like $\text{C}_{30}$ ($\text{D}_{5h}$) $\kappa$-cROOMP2 is more suitable as it conserves spatial symmetry. Lastly, we present an organic biradicaloid that does not have a $\kappa$-cROOMP2 solution in which case only AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 is applicable. We recommend $\kappa$-cROOMP2 whenever complex polarization is essential and AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 for biradicaloids without essential complex polarization but with essential spin-polarization."

Investigating the Edelstein effect and spin Hall effect in a locally noncentrosymmetric bilayer Rashba model, we clarify characteristic properties due to parity violation in the electric octupole state. Furthermore, a possible realization of electric octupole order in bilayer high-Tc cuprate superconductors is proposed. Our calculation of magnetic torque is consistent with recent experimental observation of a kink above the superconducting transition temperature. We also show significant enhancement of the in-plane anisotropy in spin susceptibility due to the superconductivity, and propose an experimental test by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance in the superconducting state. A spin-orbit coupled metal state in Cd2Re2O7 is also discussed."

The observed Shubnikov-de Hass quantum oscillation at low temperature clearly demonstrates the existence of a nontrivial band with small effective mass in ZrTe5. Furthermore, we also revealed the 3D anisotropic nature of high-field Landau level splitting in ZrTe5, very different from the 2D behavior measured in previous transport studies. Besides these, an abnormal large enhancement of magnetoresistance appears at high temperatures, which is believed to arise from the Lifshitz transition induced two-carrier transport in ZrTe5. Our study provides more understanding of the physical properties of ZrTe5 and sheds light on potential application of ZrTe5 in spintronics."

The isomorphism is then used as a base to essentially translate the differential symplectic geometry of the infinite dimensional manifolds onto the observable algebra as a noncommutative geometry, hence obtaining the latter from the physical theory itself. We have essentially an extended formalism of the Schr\""odinger versus Heisenberg picture which we try to describe mathematically as a coordinate map from the phase space, which we have presented argument to be seen as the quantum model of the physical space, to the noncommutative geometry as coordinated by the six position and momentum operators. The observable algebra is taken as an algebra of functions on the latter operators. We advocate the idea that the noncommutative geometry can be seen as an alternative, noncommutative coordinate, picture of quantum (phase) space.

The solution of this problem demands a delay constrained random access protocol. To this end we propose Admission Control based Traffic Agnostic Delay Constrained Random Access (AC/DC-RA) protocol. Our main contribution is enabling the stochastic delay constraints agnostic to the traffic, such that the stochastic delay constraint is valid with respect to varying number of arrivals. We achieve this with an admission control decision that uses a novel collision estimation algorithm for active number of arrivals per contention resource. We use an adaptive contention resolution algorithm to react to the varying number of arrivals. Using these tools, the admission control solves the stability problem. We show with simulations that AC/DC-RA provide stochastic delay constrained random access in a traffic agnostic way to sustain a stable performance against Poisson and Beta arrivals without any modification to the protocol."

The critical field $(H_{cr})$, required for the ultra-sharp jump, decreases with increase of `Sr' concentration, i.e. with increase of average A-site ionic radius $\langle r_A\rangle$. The magnetotransport data indicate that the phase separation increases with the increase of $\langle r_A\rangle$, i.e. with $y$. The dependency of $H_{cr}$ with magnetic field sweep rate reveals that the ultra-sharp jump from antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is of martensitic in nature. Our two-band double exchange model Hamiltonian calculations show that the `Sr' doping induces the ferromagnetic clusters in the antiferromagnetic insulating phase and in turn reduces the critical field. In the end we present a phenomenological picture obtained from our combined experimental and theoretical study."

This {\it ad hoc} assignment of the renormalization scale causes the coefficients of the QCD running coupling at each perturbative order to be strongly dependent on the choice of both the renormalization scale and the renormalization scheme. However, such ambiguities are not necessary, since as a basic requirement of renormalization group invariance (RGI), any physical observable must be independent of the choice of both the renormalization scheme and the renormalization scale. In fact, if one uses the {\it Principle of Maximum Conformality} (PMC) to fix the renormalization scale, the coefficients of the pQCD series match the series of conformal theory, and they are thus scheme independent. It has been found that the elimination of the scale and scheme ambiguities at all orders relies heavily on how precisely we know the analytic form of the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$. In this review, we summarize the known properties of the QCD running coupling and its recent progresses, especially for its behavior within the asymptotic region. We also summarize the current progress on the PMC and some of its typical applications, showing to what degree the conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities can be eliminated after applying the PMC. We also compare the PA approach for the conventional scale-dependent pQCD series and the PMC scale-independent conformal series. We observe that by using the conformal series, the PA approach can provide a more reliable estimate of the magnitude of the uncalculated terms. And if the conformal series for an observable has been calculated up to $n_{\rm th}$-order level, then the $[N/M]=[0/n-1]$-type PA series provides an important estimate for the higher-order terms."

It is well known that the (classical) Gauss quadrature for positive definite linear functionals is connected with orthogonal polynomials, and with the (Hermitian) Lanczos algorithm. Analogously, the Gauss quadrature for linear functionals is connected with formal orthogonal polynomials, and with the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm with look-ahead strategy; moreover, it is related to the minimal partial realization problem. We will review these connections pointing out the relationships between several results established independently in related contexts. Original proofs of the Mismatch Theorem and of the Matching Moment Property are given by using the properties of formal orthogonal polynomials and the Gauss quadrature for linear functionals."

However, there are very few materials that show multiferroicity at room temperature, which is essential to be practically useful. AlxFe2-xO3 (x-AFO) thin films, belonging to the k-Al2O3 family are interesting because they show room temperature ferrimagnetism and have a polar crystal structure. However, it is difficult to realise its ferroelectric properties at room temperature, due to low resistivity of the films. In this work, we have deposited x-AFO (0.5 <= x <= 1) epitaxial thin films with low leakage, on SrTiO3<111> substrates by Pulsed Laser Deposition. Magnetic measurements confirmed room temperature ferrimagnetism of the films, however the Curie temperature was found to be influenced by deposition conditions. First principle calculations suggested that ferroelectric domain switching occurs through shearing of in-plane oxygen layers, and predicted a high polarization value of 24 uC/cm2. However, actual ferroelectric measurements showed the polarization to be two order less. Presence of multiple in-plane domains which oppose polarization switching of adjacent domains, was found to be the cause for the small observed polarization. Comparing dielectric relaxation studies and ferroelectric characterization showed that oxygen-vacancy defects assist domain wall motion, which in turn facilitates polarization switching."

Zipf on the relationship between word frequency and other word features led to the formulation of various linguistic laws. The most popular is Zipf's law for word frequencies. Here we focus on two laws that have been studied less intensively: the meaning-frequency law, i.e. the tendency of more frequent words to be more polysemous, and the law of abbreviation, i.e. the tendency of more frequent words to be shorter. In a previous work, we tested the robustness of these Zipfian laws for English, roughly measuring word length in number of characters and distinguishing adult from child speech. In the present article, we extend our study to other languages (Dutch and Spanish) and introduce two additional measures of length: syllabic length and phonemic length. Our correlation analysis indicates that both the meaning-frequency law and the law of abbreviation hold overall in all the analyzed languages."

Despite the success of magnetic monopole models, a full understanding of the energetics and relaxation rates in this material has remained elusive, while recent studies have shown that defects play a central role in the magnetic dynamics. We used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope to study the spatial and temporal magnetic fluctuations in three regions with different defect densities from a Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ single crystal as a function of temperature. We found that the magnetic flux noise power spectra are not determined by simple thermally-activated behavior and observed evidence of magnetic screening that is qualitatively consistent with Debye-like screening due to a dilute gas of low-mobility magnetic monopoles. This work establishes magnetic flux spectroscopy as a powerful tool for studying materials with complex magnetic dynamics, including frustrated correlated spin systems."

In addition to numerous living and artificial active microswimmers, a passive microswimmer was identified only recently: a soft, Lambda-shaped, non-buoyant particle propagates in a shaken liquid of zero-mean velocity [Jo et al. Phys. Rev. E 94, 063116 (2016)]. We show that this novel passive locomotion mechanism works for realistic non-buoyant, asymmetric Janus microcapsules as well. According to our analytical approximation, this locomotion requires a symmetry breaking caused by different Stokes drags of soft particles during the two half periods of the oscillatory liquid motion. It is the intrinsic anisotropy of Janus capsules and Lambda-shaped particles that break this symmetry for sinusoidal liquid motion. Further, we show that this passive locomotion mechanism also works for the wider class of symmetric soft particles, e.g., capsules, by breaking the symmetry via an appropriate liquid shaking. The swimming direction can be uniquely selected by a suitable choice of the liquid motion. Numerical studies, including lattice Boltzmann simulations, also show that this locomotion can outweigh gravity, i.e., non-buoyant particles may be either elevated in shaken liquids or concentrated at the bottom of a container. This novel propulsion mechanism is relevant to many applications, including the sorting of soft particles like healthy and malignant (cancer) cells, which serves medical purposes, or the use of non-buoyant soft particles as directed microswimmers ."

In the present paper we demonstrate how this pedagogical prerogative can inform the design of an experiment involving an accelerometer-equipped smartphone rotating uniformly in a horizontal plane. Specifically, the location of the sensor itself within the body of the smartphone will be determined using a technique that is purely geometrical in nature, relying on nothing more than the notion that centripetal accelerations are centrally-pointing. The complete absence of algebraic manipulations obliges students to focus exclusively on the development of their geometrical reasoning abilities. In particular, it provides a healthy challenge for those algebraically-accomplished students for whom equations, calculations and data tables represent a means of avoiding a direct confrontation with the imposing spectre of material that is otherwise purely conceptual in nature."

The choice of this modification is made as a specific way of including new terms in the right-hand side of the Einstein field equations, resulting in constant effective inertial mass density and, importantly, leading to an explicit exact solution of the matter energy density in terms of redshift. We look for viable cosmologies, in particular, an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. EMLG provides an effective dynamical dark energy passing below zero at large redshifts, accommodating a mechanism for screening $\Lambda$ in this region, in line with suggestions for alleviating some of the tensions that arise between observational data sets within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We present a detailed theoretical investigation of the model and then constrain the free parameter $\alpha'$, a normalisation of $\alpha$, using the latest observational data. The data does not rule out the $\Lambda$CDM limit of our model ($\alpha'= 0$), but prefers slightly negative values of the EMLG model parameter ($\alpha'= -0.032\pm 0.043$), which leads to the screening of $\Lambda$. We also discuss how EMLG relaxes the persistent tension that appears in the measurements of $H_0$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model."

The operator equations are defined as infinitely many equations given via a compact set of functionals in the dual of an underlying Hilbert space, and then the greedy algorithm, defined directly in the dual Hilbert space, selects N functionals step by step. When N functionals are selected, the operator equation is numerically solved by projection onto the span of the Riesz representers of the functionals. Orthonormalizing these yields useful Reduced Basis functions. By recent results on greedy methods in Hilbert spaces, the convergence rate is asymptotically given by Kolmogoroff N-widths and therefore optimal in that sense. However, these N-widths seem to be unknown in PDE applications. Numerical experiments show that for solving elliptic second-order Dirichlet problems, the greedy method of this paper behaves like the known P-greedy method for interpolation, applied to second derivatives. Since the latter technique is known to realize Kolmogoroff N-widths for interpolation, it is hypothesized that the Kolmogoroff N-widths for solving second-order PDEs behave like the Kolmogoroff N-widths for second derivatives, but this is an open theoretical problem."

These can be described following the classical approach embodied in the Color Glass Condensate effective theory, which approximates QCD in the high gluon density regime. In this framework we perform an analytical first-principles calculation of the two-point correlator of the divergence of the Chern-Simons current at proper time $\tau\!=\!0^+$, which characterizes the early fluctuations of axial charge density in the plane transverse to the collision axis. This object plays a crucial role in the description of anomalous transport phenomena such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect. We compare our results to those obtained under the Glasma Graph approximation, which assumes gluon field correlators to obey Gaussian statistics. While this approach proves to be equivalent to the exact calculation in the limit of short transverse separations, important differences arise at larger distances, where our expression displays a remarkably slower fall-off than the Glasma Graph result ($1/r^4$ vs.\ $1/r^8$ power-law decay). This discrepancy emerges from the non-linear dynamics mapping the Gaussianly-distributed color source densities onto the Glasma fields, encoded in the classical Yang-Mills equations. Our results support the conclusions reached in a previous work, where we found indications that the color screening of correlations in the transverse plane occurs at relatively large distances."

The closeness of the $P_c(4312)$ to the $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ threshold and the $P_c(4440)$/$P_c(4457)$ to the $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ one suggests a molecular interpretation of these resonances. We show that these three pentaquark-like resonances can be naturally accommodated in a contact-range effective field theory description that incorporates heavy-quark spin symmetry. This description leads to the prediction of all the seven possible S-wave heavy antimeson-baryon molecules (that is, there should be four additional molecular pentaquarks in addition to the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$), providing the first example of a heavy-quark spin symmetry molecular multiplet that is complete. If this is confirmed, it will not only give us an impressive example of the application of heavy-quark symmetries and effective field theories in hadron physics: it will also uncover a clear and powerful ordering principle for the molecular spectrum, reminiscent of the SU(3)-flavor multiplets to which the light hadron spectrum conforms."

Canonically, thermal inversions in hot Jupiters have been suggested to be caused by species such as TiO and VO which have strong visible opacity to absorb incident starlight. We explore two new avenues for thermal inversions in hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible and infrared opacities in their atmospheres. Firstly, by exploring a range of metal-rich species we find that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH and MgH) provide visible opacities comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with reasonable abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by a low H$_2$O abundance, e.g. through a C/O~1, can also lead to strong thermal inversions even with low abundances of the visible absorbers mentioned above. We find that increasing the C/O ratio towards unity requires almost 2 orders of magnitude lower abundances for the visible absorbers in order for an inversion to form. Finally, we explore the thermal inversion in WASP-121b and find that it can be explained by all the visible absorbers listed above for different C/O ratios. Our study demonstrates the importance of both the refractory and volatile species in governing the physicochemical processes in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Spectroscopic observations in the visible have the potential to detect the newly proposed refractory species that can cause thermal inversions in addition to TiO and VO."

These mergers result in a remnant black hole, possibly surrounded by an accretion disk. The mass and spin of the remnant black hole depend on the properties of the coalescing binary. We construct a map from the binary components to the remnant black hole using a sample of numerical-relativity simulations of different mass ratios $q$, (anti-)aligned dimensionless spins of the black hole $a_{\rm BH}$, and several neutron star equations of state. Given the binary total mass, the mass and spin of the remnant black hole can therefore be determined from the three parameters $(q,a_{\rm BH},\Lambda)$, where $\Lambda$ is the tidal deformability of the neutron star. Our models also incorporate the binary black hole and test-mass limit cases and we discuss a simple extension for generic black hole spins. We combine the remnant characterization with recent population synthesis simulations for various metallicities of the progenitor stars that generated the binary system. We predict that black-hole-neutron-star mergers produce a population of remnant black holes with masses distributed around $7M_\odot$ and $9M_\odot$. For isotropic spin distributions, nonmassive accretion disks are favoured: no bright electromagnetic counterparts are expected in such mergers."

Specifically, our constructive proof shows the reductions between the template-based synthesis problem, which generates a program in a pre-specified form, and the reachability problem, which decides the reachability of a program location. This establishes a link between the two research fields and allows for the transfer of techniques and results between them.   To demonstrate the equivalence, we develop a program repair prototype using reachability tools. We transform a buggy program and its required specification into a specific program containing a location reachable only when the original program can be repaired, and then apply an off-the-shelf test-input generation tool on the transformed program to find test values to reach the desired location. Those test values correspond to repairs for the original programm. Preliminary results suggest that our approach compares favorably to other repair methods."

We define new semantics for the CCG combinators that is better suited to deriving AMR graphs. In particular, we define relation-wise alternatives for the application and composition combinators: these require that the two constituents being combined overlap in one AMR relation. We also provide a new semantics for type raising, which is necessary for certain constructions. Using these mechanisms, we suggest an analysis of eventive nouns, which present a challenge for deriving AMR graphs. Our theoretical analysis will facilitate future work on robust and transparent AMR parsing using CCG."

The evidential reasoning approach is one of the most effective methods to deal with such MADA problems. As kernel of the evidential reasoning approach, an original evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm was firstly proposed by Yang et al, and later they modified the ER algorithm in order to satisfy the proposed four synthesis axioms with which a rational aggregation process needs to satisfy. However, up to present, the essential difference of the two ER algorithms as well as the rationality of the synthesis axioms are still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the ER algorithms in Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) framework and prove that the original ER algorithm follows the reliability discounting and combination scheme, while the modified one follows the importance discounting and combination scheme. Further we reveal that the four synthesis axioms are not valid criteria to check the rationality of one attribute aggregation algorithm. Based on these new findings, an extended ER algorithm is proposed to take into account both the reliability and importance of different attributes, which provides a more general attribute aggregation scheme for MADA with uncertainty. A motorcycle performance assessment problem is examined to illustrate the proposed algorithm."

However, the measured signal in $Planck$ detectors is integrated over large bandpass $(\Delta \nu)/\nu \simeq 0.2$. Consequently, the derived CO products are composite maps including several rotational lines. In the 100 GHz $Planck$ channel, the two main lines are the J=1-0 transitions of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO at 115 and 110 GHz respectively. In the present paper, we present and applied a method to construct separate CO integrated intensity maps for the two isotopes. The measurement of the $^{13}$CO rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky view of the Galaxy for this isotope."

In this paper we show that the predictions obtained from the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPFP) or equivalently maximum entropy (ME) can be obtained by restricted maximum likelihood estimation relying on augmented Lagrangian optimization. Based on the equivalence we extend the framework of network reconstruction towards regression by allowing for exogenous covariates and random heterogeneity effects. The proposed estimation approach is compared with different competing methods for network reconstruction and matrix estimation. Exemplary, we apply the approach to interbank lending data, provided by the Bank for International Settlement (BIS). This dataset provides full knowledge of the real network and is therefore suitable to evaluate the predictions of our approach. It is shown that the inclusion of exogenous information allows for superior predictions in terms of $L_1$ and $L_2$ errors. Additionally, the approach allows to obtain prediction intervals via bootstrap that can be used to quantify the uncertainty attached to the predictions."

The conventional approach is to discretize on a grid conforming to the geometry. However grid construction is challenging, and this difficulty is compounded for evolving domains. Several methods instead augment the equations themselves to implicitly enforce the boundary conditions. This paper examines the Volume Penalty Method, which approximates Dirichlet boundary conditions in the Navier Stokes equations with rapid linear damping (non-dimensional time scale $\eta$) inside the object. This technique is proven to converge to the true solution, and also leads to simple volume-integral force and torque calculations. Unfortunately, previous analysis showed convergence of only $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{1/2})$. We analyze the source of this error using matched asymptotic expansions and show that it stems from a displacement length, proportional to a Reynolds number Re dependent boundary layer of size $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{1/2}\text{Re}^{-1/2})$. The relative size of the displacement length and damping time scale lead to the emergence of multiple asymptotic regimes. The key finding is that there is a simple correction that can be efficiently calculated to eliminate the displacement length and promote the accuracy to $\mathcal{O}(\eta)$. This improvement also extends to the force and torque calculations. We demonstrate these findings in 1D planar Poiseuille flow, 2D steady flow past a viscous stagnation point, and 2D unsteady flow past a rotating cylinder, and finally show that Richardson extrapolation can be used with our correction to further improve convergence to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{2})$."

The question of whether these trained algorithms have cross-survey identification ability or can be adapted to develop classification networks for future surveys is still unclear. One possible solution to address this issue is transfer learning, which re-uses elements of existing machine learning models for different applications. Here we present radio galaxy classification based on a 13-layer Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) using transfer learning methods between different radio surveys. We find that our machine learning models trained from a random initialization achieve accuracies comparable to those found elsewhere in the literature. When using transfer learning methods, we find that inheriting model weights pre-trained on FIRST images can boost model performance when re-training on lower resolution NVSS data, but that inheriting pre-trained model weights from NVSS and re-training on FIRST data impairs the performance of the classifier. We consider the implication of these results in the context of future radio surveys planned for next-generation radio telescopes such as ASKAP, MeerKAT, and SKA1-MID."

In the first phase of the study, we develop the method. In the second stage, we test and evaluate the method via an empirical study; also, an experiment was conducted within web interface with the gradual intensity of visual elements.The findings reveal that negative response grows faster than conversion when the visual intensity of the web interface is increased. However, a saturation point, where there is coexistence between maximum conversion and minimum negative response, can be found. The findings imply that efforts to attract user attention should be pursued with increased caution and that a gradual approach presented in this study helps in finding a site-specific sweet-spot for a level of visual intensity by incrementally adjusting the elements of the interface and tracking the changes in user behaviour. Web marketing and advertising professionals often face the dilemma of determining the optimal level of visual intensity of interface element. Excessive use of marketing component and attention-grabbing visual elements can lead to an inferior user experience and consequent user churn due to growing intrusiveness. At the same time, too little visual intensity can fail to steer users. The present study provides a gradual approach which aids in finding a balance between user experience and visual intensity, maximising user conversion and thus providing a practical solution for the problem."

As the involved engineers are self-interested agents, the goals at different levels of the systems engineering hierarchy may deviate from the system-level goals which may cause budget and schedule overruns. Therefore, there is a need of a systems engineering theory that accounts for the human behavior in systems design. To this end, the objective of this paper is to develop and analyze a principal-agent model of a one-shot (single iteration), shallow (one level of hierarchy) systems engineering process. We assume that the systems engineer maximizes the expected utility of the system, while the subsystem engineers seek to maximize their expected utilities. Furthermore, the systems engineer is unable to monitor the effort of the subsystem engineer and may not have a complete information about their types or the complexity of the design task. However, the systems engineer can incentivize the subsystem engineers by proposing specific contracts. To obtain an optimal incentive, we pose and solve numerically a bi-level optimization problem. Through extensive simulations, we study the optimal incentives arising from different system-level value functions under various combinations of effort costs, problem-solving skills, and task complexities."

In Combinatorial Design Theory, so-called difference methods represent a well-known solution technique and construct solutions in infinitely many cases exploiting symmetric and balanced structures. This approach reduces the problem to finding a well-structured $2$-factor which allows us to build solutions that we call $1$- or $2$-rotational according to their symmetries. We tackle $OP$ by modeling difference methods with Optimization tools, specifically Constraint Programming ($CP$) and Integer Programming ($IP$), and correspondingly solve instances with up to $v=120$ within $60s$. In particular, we model the $2$-rotational method by solving in cascade two subproblems, namely the binary and group labeling, respectively. A polynomial-time algorithm solves the binary labeling, while $CP$ tackles the group labeling. Furthermore, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of some $1$-rotational solutions which stem from computational results. This paper shows thereby that both theoretical and empirical results may arise from the interaction between Combinatorial Design Theory and Operation Research."

However, when the number of tasks increases so do the complexity of the architectural adjustments and resource requirements. In this paper, we introduce a method which applies a conditional feature-wise transformation over the convolutional activations that enables a model to successfully perform a large number of tasks. To distinguish from regular MTL, we introduce Many Task Learning (MaTL) as a special case of MTL where more than 20 tasks are performed by a single model. Our method dubbed Task Routing (TR) is encapsulated in a layer we call the Task Routing Layer (TRL), which applied in an MaTL scenario successfully fits hundreds of classification tasks in one model.

Neutrinos within the right energy range can be produced in large quantities at accelerator facilities via pion Decay At Rest ($\pi$DAR) and used to measure CE$\nu$NS. This new channel opens several, interesting possibilities: studying the CE$\nu$NS spectrum it will be possible, for example, to search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model, looking for deviations from the predictions of the electroweak theory; it can also give important inputs for the understanding of core collapse supernovas, where neutrino-nucleus interactions and, more generally, collective neutrino behavior play a crucial role. Using CE$\nu$NS it is also possible to measure precisely the electroweak form factor for a large number of different nuclei, extracting information on the neutron distribution inside the nucleus as well. In this presentation I will focus on the last aspect: I will calculated the precision that can be achieved in such kind of experiment, investigating in particular the effects of the low-energy threshold and the systematic errors on the quenching factor.

The difficulty in early ARDS recognition stems from its complex and heterogenous nature. In this study, we integrate knowledge of the heterogeneity of ARDS patients into predictive model building. Using MIMIC-III data, we first apply latent class analysis (LCA) to identify homogeneous sub-groups in the ARDS population, and then build predictive models on the partitioned data.

Using a conformal factor ansatz that is valid only for four dimensional geometries, we obtain a closed expression for the $O(\alpha')$ metric corrections in the case of several orbifold limits of K3, namely $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_n$ where $n=2,3,4,6$. However, we find that non-standard embedding requires the inclusion of five-branes on such orbifolds. We also numerically investigate the behaviour around orbifold fixed points by considering the metric correction on the resolution of a $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ singularity. In this case, a non-trivial conformal factor can be obtained in non-standard embedding even without five-branes. In the same manner, we generalise our analysis to study metric corrections on $T^6/\mathbb{Z}_3$ and its resolution described by a complex line bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$. Further prospects of utilising these $O(\alpha')$ corrected metrics as a novel approach in obtaining realistic or semi-realistic Yukawa couplings are discussed."

By controlling the strength of the driving field, we engineer a mechanical gain that balances the losses of the undriven resonator. This gain-loss balance corresponds to the threshold where both coupled mechanical resonators enter simultaneously into self-sustained limit cycle oscillations regime. Rich sets of collective dynamics such as in-phase and out-of-phase synchronizations therefore emerge, depending on the mechanical coupling rate, the optically induced mechanical gain and spring effect, and the frequency mismatch between the resonators. Moreover, we introduce the quadratic coupling that induces enhancement of the in-phase synchronization. This work shows how phonon transport can remotely induce synchronization in coupled mechanical resonator array and opens up new avenues for metrology, communication, phonon-processing, and novel memories concepts."

The algorithm is adapted to decoding digital holograms. A hologram is a two-dimensional light interference pattern that encodes information about three-dimensional shapes and their optical properties. The formation of the hologram is modeled using Maxwell theory for light scattering by particles. We then seek shapes optimizing error functionals which measure the deviation from the recorded holograms. Their topological derivatives provide initial guesses of the objects. Next, we correct these predictions by regularized Gauss-Newton techniques. In contrast to standard Gauss-Newton methods, in our implementation the number of objects can be automatically updated during the iterative procedure by new topological derivative computations. We show that the combined use of topological derivative based optimization and iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton methods produces fast and accurate descriptions of the geometry of objects formed by multiple components with nanoscale resolution, even for a small number of detectors and non convex components aligned in the incidence direction. The method could be applied in general imaging set-ups involving other waves (microwave imaging, elastography...) provided closed-form expressions for the topological and Frechet derivatives are determined."

In the relevant parameter regime, the system is slow-fast with two slow variables and one fast. The oscillation is special for several reasons: Firstly, its singular limit is unbounded, the amplitude of the cycle growing like $\log \epsilon^{-1}$ as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. As a consequence of this estimate, the unboundedness of the cycle cannot be captured by a simple $\epsilon$-dependent scaling of the variables, see e.g. \cite{Gucwa2009783}. We therefore obtain its limit on the Poincar\'e sphere. Here we find that the singular limit consists of a slow part on an attracting critical manifold, and a fast part on the equator (i.e. at $\infty$) of the Poincar\'e sphere, which includes motion along a center manifold. The reduced flow on this center manifold runs out along the manifold's boundary, in a special way, leading to a complex return to the slow manifold. We prove the existence of the limit cycle by showing that a return map is a contraction. The main technical difficulty in this part is due to the fact that the critical manifold loses hyperbolicity at an exponential rate at infinity. We therefore use the method in \cite{kristiansen2017a}, applying the standard blowup technique in an extended phase space. In this way we identify a singular cycle, consisting of $12$ pieces, all with desirable hyperbolicity properties, that enables the perturbation into an actual limit cycle for $0<\epsilon\ll 1$."

It is expected that this type of fragmentation may have radio signatures. The general aim of the present paper is to perform a comparative analysis of type III solar and narrow-band type-III-like radio burst properties before and during CME events, respectively. The main goal is to analyze radio observational signatures of the dynamical processes in solar corona. In particular, we aim to perform a comparison of local plasma parameters without and with CME propagation, based on the analysis of decameter radio emission data. We performed a comparison of usual type III bursts before the CME with narrow-band type-III-like bursts, which are observationally detectable on top of the background type IV radio bursts associated with CME propagation. We focused on the analysis of in total 429 type III and 129 narrow-band type-III-like bursts. We studied their main characteristic parameters such as frequency drift rate, duration, and instantaneous frequency bandwidth using standard statistical methods. Furthermore, we inferred local plasma parameters using known definitions of frequency drift, duration, and instantaneous frequency bandwidth.The analysis reveals that the physical parameters of coronal plasma before CMEs considerably differ from those during the propagation of CMEs (the observational periods 2 and 4 with type IV radio bursts associated with CMEs). Local density radial profiles and the characteristic spatial scales of radio emission sources vary with radial distance more drastically during the CME propagation compared to the cases of quasistatic solar atmosphere without CME(s) (observational periods 1 and 3). The results of the work enable us to distinguish different regimes of plasma state in the solar corona."

This copper concentration is well in excess of that required for superconductivity, $x < 0.04$. We have investigated the development of magnetism in this compound using $^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and spin-lattice relaxation measurements performed on single crystals ($x$ = 0.13, 0.18, 0.24, and 0.39). We find multiple inequivalent Na sites, each of which is associated with a different number of nearest neighbor Fe sites occupied by a Cu dopant. We show that the distribution of Cu substituted for Fe is random in-plane for low concentrations ($x = 0.13$ and 0.18), but deviates from this with increasing Cu doping. As is characteristic of many pnictide compounds, there is a spin pseudo gap that increases in magnitude with dopant concentration. This is correlated with a corresponding increase in orbital NMR frequency shift indicating a change in valence from Cu$^{2+}$ to a Cu$^{1+}$ state as $x$ exceeds 0.18, concomitant with the change of Fe$^{2+}$ to Fe$^{3+}$ resulting in the formation of magnetic clusters. However, for $x\leq 0.39$ there is no evidence of long-range static magnetic order."

By multiple Monte Carlo simulations, it is indicated that the I-Cube model offered a more accurate and more reasonable option for collision probability estimation in the space debris evolution process.

First, the shell structure that is unique in very weakly-bound neutrons is systematically studied, and the approximate neutron number of odd-N nuclei at which spherical (or deformed) halos can be found is pinned down. Second, the difference of the shell structure in r-process nuclei from that in stable nuclei is examined. Third, the similarity and the difference between the shell structure of N=20 IoI nuclei and that of N=40 IoI nuclei are analyzed.

In recent work, we had self-consistently coupled DSA and radiation transfer simulations in blazar jets. These one-zone models determined that the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars strongly constrain the nature of the hydromagnetic turbulence responsible for pitch-angle scattering. In this paper, we expand our previous work by including full time dependence and treating two emission zones, one being the site of acceleration. This modeling is applied to a multiwavelength flare of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C~279, fitting snap-shot SEDs and light curves. We predict spectral hysteresis patterns in various energy bands as well as cross-band time lags with optical and GeV gamma-rays as well as radio and X-rays tracing each other closely with zero time lag, but radio and X-rays lagging behind the optical and gamma-ray variability by several hours."

All these features are then promoted to properties of the observables arising in the classical version of such theories. Focusing on radiation, we provide two main applications: 1) An exponential Soft Theorem relating conservative effects and gravitational radiation to all orders in $\omega$; whose leading order directly leads to the $D=4$ Memory Effect. 2) A classical double copy to evaluate gravitational radiation from QED Bremsstrahlung, matching previous classical computations and extending them to spin-quadrupole order."

In this paper, we revisit the Split-Family SUSY model in light of the updated LHC constraints. We also study the flavor changing neutral current problems in the model. As we will show, the problems do not lead to stringent constraints when the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is the only source of the flavor mixing.

In prior work, we studied Wigner distributions $W_{\hbar, E_N(\hbar)}(x, \xi)$ of individual eigenspace projections. In this continuation, we study Weyl sums of such Wigner distributions as the eigenvalue $E_N(\hbar)$ ranges over spectral intervals $[E - \delta(\hbar), E + \delta(\hbar)]$ of various widths $\delta(\hbar)$ and as $(x, \xi) \in T^*\mathbb R^d$ ranges over tubes of various widths around the classical energy surface $\Sigma_E \subset T^*\mathbb R^d$. The main results pertain to interface Airy scaling asymptotics around $\Sigma_E$, which divides phase space into an allowed and a forbidden region. The first result pertains to $\delta(\hbar) = \hbar$ widths and generalizes our earlier results on Wigner distributions of individual eigenspace projections. Our second result pertains to $\delta(\hbar) = \hbar^{2/3}$ spectral widths and Airy asymptotics of the Wigner distributions in $\hbar^{2/3}$-tubes around $\Sigma_E$.

In this work, we show that surface states of topological metals can contribute with the same order of magnitude as the bulk even in large systems. This effect is intimately related to the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, in which an applied voltage induces chiral surface-state currents proportional to the system size. Unlike the anomalous Hall effect, the large contribution of surface states to the dc conductivity is also present in time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals, where the surface states come in counter-propagating time-reversed pairs. While the Hall voltage vanishes in the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the twinned chiral surface currents develop similarly as in the time-reversal broken case. For this effect to occur, the relaxation length associated with scattering between time-reversed partner states needs to be larger than the separation of contributing surfaces, which results in a characteristic size dependence of the resistivity and a highly inhomogeneous current-density profile across the sample."

In contrast to traditional relational learning methods that leverage first-order logic for representing such data, these deep learning methods aim at re-representing symbolic relational data in Euclidean spaces. They offer better scalability, but can only numerically approximate relational structures and are less flexible in terms of reasoning tasks supported. This paper introduces a novel framework for relational representation learning that combines the best of both worlds. This framework, inspired by the auto-encoding principle, uses first-order logic as a data representation language, and the mapping between the original and latent representation is done by means of logic programs instead of neural networks. We show how learning can be cast as a constraint optimisation problem for which existing solvers can be used. The use of logic as a representation language makes the proposed framework more accurate (as the representation is exact, rather than approximate), more flexible, and more interpretable than deep learning methods. We experimentally show that these latent representations are indeed beneficial in relational learning tasks."

We present silicon nitride broadband asymmetric directional coupler designs with 50/50 and 90/10 splitting ratios with a central wavelength of 840 nm for both TE- and TM-like polarization. We show that silicon nitride broadband asymmetric directional couplers can be designed accurately in a time efficient way by using a general implementation of the coupled mode theory.

In this paper, we study analogues of the Birkhoff polytope for finite irreducible Coxeter groups of other types. We focus on a type-$B$ Birkhoff polytope $\mathcal{BB}(n)$ arising from signed permutation matrices and prove that it and its dual polytope are reflexive, and hence Gorenstein, and also possess regular, unimodular triangulations. Noting that our triangulation proofs do not rely on the combinatorial structure of $\mathcal{BB}(n)$, we define the notion of an orthant-lattice property polytope and use this to prove more general results for the existence of regular, unimodular triangulations and unimodular covers for a significant family of reflexive polytopes.

Here we present anomalous behaviour seen in the blazar 3C 454.3 based on an analysis of quasi-simultaneous data at optical, UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray energies, spanning about 9 years from August 2008 to February 2017. We have identified four time intervals (epochs), A, B, D and E, when the source showed large-amplitude optical flares. In epochs A and B the optical and $\gamma$-ray flares are correlated, while in D and E corresponding flares in $\gamma$-rays are weak or absent. In epoch B the degree of optical polarization strongly correlates with changes in optical flux during a short-duration optical flare superimposed on one of long duration. In epoch E the optical flux and degree of polarization are anti-correlated during both the rising and declining phases of the optical flare. We carried out broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the source for the flaring epochs A,B, D and E, and a quiescent epoch, C. Our SED modeling indicates that optical flares with absent or weak corresponding $\gamma$-ray flares in epochs D and E could arise from changes in a combination of parameters, such as the bulk Lorentz factor, magnetic field and electron energy density, or be due to changes in the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting regions."

Linear stability analysis is performed to study the nature of the equilibrium states against uniform and nonuniform perturbations. Emphasis is given to the occurrence of Hopf, Turing and Wave bifurcations. The weakly nonlinear analysis is then employed to deduce the equation governing the time evolution of pattern amplitude and to obtain the analytical approximated solution. The influence of the hyperbolic structure of the model on the pattern formation as well as on the transient regimes is highlighted. The theoretical predictions are illustrated on the hyperbolic Schnakenberg model and linear and weakly nonlinear stability are investigated both analytically and numerically."

From the dendrogram analysis, we identified several accretion flows feeding the circumbinary disk in a highly anisotropic manner. Stream-like SO emission around the circumbinary disk reveals the complicated shocks caused by the interactions between the disk, accretion flows and outflows. A wall-like structure is discovered south of VLA1623B. The discovery of two outflow cavity walls at the same position traveling at different velocities suggests the two outflows from both VLA1623A and VLA1623B overlays on top of each other in the plane of sky. Our detailed flat and flared disk modeling shows that Cycle 2 C18O J = 2-1 data is inconsistent with the combined binary mass of 0.2 Msun as suggested by early Cycle 0 studies. The combined binary mass for VLA1623A should be modified to 0.3 ~ 0.5 Msun."

Our Multi Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS) has been used to simulate the propagation of a CME in a data driven solar corona background computed using the photospheric magnetogram data. We constrain the CME model parameters using the observations of such key CME properties as its speed, orientation, and poloidal flux. The speed and orientation are estimated using multi-viewpoint white-light coronagraph images. The reconnected magnetic flux in the area covered by the post eruption arcade is used to estimate the poloidal flux in the CME flux rope. We simulate the partial halo CME on 7 March 2011 to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. This CME erupted with the speed of 812 km/s and its poloidal flux, as estimated from source active region data, was 4.9e21 Mx. Using our approach, we were able to simulate this CME with the speed 840 km/s and the poloidal flux of 5.1e21 Mx, in remarkable agreement with the observations."

Measured by the expected loss under the worst-case scenario, financial risk caused by model uncertainty is regarded as a result of the interaction between financial market and external information sources. This forms a thermodynamic picture in which a closed system interacts with an external reservoir, reaching its equilibrium at the worst-case scenario. The severity of the worst-case scenario depends on the rate of heat dissipation, caused by information sources reducing the entropy of the system. This thermodynamic picture leads to simple and natural derivation of the characterization rules of the worst-case risk, and gives its Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms. With its help financial practitioners may evaluate risks utilizing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics."

This layer seeks to extract the underlying subspace from a latent representation of the given data and removes outliers that lie away from this subspace. It is used within an autoencoder. The encoder maps the data into a latent space, from which the RSR layer extracts the subspace. The decoder then smoothly maps back the underlying subspace to a ""manifold"" close to the original inliers. Inliers and outliers are distinguished according to the distances between the original and mapped positions (small for inliers and large for outliers). Extensive numerical experiments with both image and document datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art precision and recall."

It aims at recognizing unseen class instances with knowledge transferred from seen classes. This is typically achieved by exploiting a pre-defined semantic feature space (FS), i.e., semantic attributes or word vectors, as a bridge to transfer knowledge between seen and unseen classes. However, due to the absence of unseen classes during training, the conventional ZSR easily suffers from domain shift and hubness problems. In this paper, we propose a novel ZSR learning framework that can handle these two issues well by adaptively adjusting semantic FS. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider the adaptive adjustment of semantic FS in ZSR. Moreover, our solution can be formulated to a more efficient framework that significantly boosts the training. Extensive experiments show the remarkable performance improvement of our model compared with other existing methods."

The eigenvalues provide detailed gate information, supplementary to known gate-quality measures such as the gate fidelity, and can be used as a gate diagnostic tool.

Its key ingredient is a process that we call focusing, which allows to obtain a schema for a (possibly knowledge-enriched) database semi-automatically, given an ontology and a specification of the scope of the desired system. We formalize the inputs and outputs of focusing, and identify relevant computational problems: finding a schema via focusing, testing its consistency, and answering queries in the knowledge-enriched databases it produces. These definitions are fully independent of the ontology language. We then instantiate the framework using selected description logics as ontology languages, and popular classes of queries for specifying the scope of the system. For several representative combinations, we study the decidability and complexity of the identified computational problems. As a by-product, we isolate (and solve) variants of classical decision problems in description logics, that are interesting in their own right."

For this purpose, we obtain the effective density and pressure for Einstein-Aether theory. We reconstruct the Einstein-Aether models by comparing its energy density with various newly proposed holographic dark energy models such as Tsallis, R$\acute{e}$nyi and Sharma-Mittal. For this reconstruction, we use two forms of scale factor, power-law and exponential forms. The cosmological analysis of underlying scenario has been done by exploring different cosmological parameters. This includes equation of state parameter, squared speed of sound and evolutionary equation of state parameter via graphical representation. We obtain some favorable results for some values of model parameters."

We present a modification of the embedded atom method (EAM) which allows for electronic polarization of the metal by treating the valence density around each atom as a fluctuating dynamical quantity. The densities are represented by a set of additional fluctuating variables (and their conjugate momenta) which are propagated along with the nuclear coordinates. This ``density readjusting EAM'' (DR-EAM) preserves nearly all of the useful qualities of traditional EAM, including bulk elastic properties and surface energies. However, it also allows valence electron density to migrate through the metal in response to external perturbations. We show that DR-EAM can successfully model polarization in response to external charges, capturing the image charge effect in atomistic simulations. DR-EAM also captures some of the behavior of metals in the presence of uniform electric fields, predicting surface charging and shielding internal to the metal. We further show that it predicts charge transfer between the constituent atoms in alloys, leading to novel predictions about unit cell geometries in layered L$1_0$ structures."

Diagnostics","Stellar bow shocks, bow waves, and dust waves all result from the action of a star's wind and radiation pressure on a stream of dusty plasma that flows past it. The dust in these bows emits prominently at mid-infrared wavelengths in the range 8 to 60 micron. We propose a novel diagnostic method, the tau-eta diagram, for analyzing these bows, which is based on comparing the fractions of stellar radiative energy and stellar radiative momentum that is trapped by the bow shell. This diagram allows the discrimination of wind-supported bow shocks, radiation-supported bow waves, and dust waves in which grains decouple from the gas. For the wind-supported bow shocks, it allows the stellar wind mass-loss rate to be determined. We critically compare our method with a previous method that has been proposed for determining wind mass-loss rates from bow shock observations. This comparison points to ways in which both methods can be improved and suggests a downward revision by a factor of two with respect to previously reported mass-loss rates. From a sample of 23 mid-infrared bow-shaped sources, we identify at least 4 strong candidates for radiation-supported bow waves, which need to be confirmed by more detailed studies, but no strong candidates for dust waves."

HD\,176843 is classified as a marginal Am star that shows $\delta$\ Sct type pulsations. From an analysis of the {\it Kepler} time series, we find that the light curve of HD\,176843 is dominated by three modes with frequencies $f_{1}$=0.1145, $f_{2}$=0.0162 and $f_{3}$=0.1078 d$^{-1}$. The amplitude of the radial velocity variations of about 10 km/s is much more than the radial velocity errors and allows us to conclude clear radial velocity variations. Using the radial velocity data and the adopted spectra, the orbital solution of HD\,176843 is also obtained with an orbital period of 34.14 days. However, the available photometric data show no significant evidence for any possible motion in the binary system."

The existing blockchain solutions have downsides in communication and storage efficiency, convergence to centralization, and consistency problems. In this paper, we propose LightChain, which is the first blockchain architecture that operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers. LightChain is a permissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and transactions within the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all the peers. Each block and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and is retrieved in an on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not required to retrieve or keep the entire blockchain. LightChain is fair as all of the participating peers have a uniform chance of being involved in the consensus regardless of their influence such as hashing power or stake. LightChain provides a deterministic fork-resolving strategy as well as a blacklisting mechanism, and it is secure against colluding adversarial peers attacking the availability and integrity of the system. We provide mathematical analysis and experimental results on scenarios involving 10K nodes to demonstrate the security and fairness of LightChain."

This calculation is based on boundary string field theory, and we have a problem of a choice of Weyl factors on the two boundaries of one-loop open string world-sheet. We have chosen one of them and compute the one-loop free energy. In this paper, we derive the mass spectrum of open strings on a D-brane--anti-D-brane pair supposing that the world-sheet is a strip, and compute the thermal vacuum state, free energy and the partition function for a single open string in the framework of thermo field dynamics. From this we can reproduce the free energy for multiple strings in the case of Matsubara method. This fact reinforces our argument of the choice of the Weyl factors in the case of Matsubara formalism."

The development of automatic classification requires the collection of a complete labeled data set, where true clinical outcomes are obtained by human expert manual review. For example, the development of natural language processing algorithms requires the abstraction of clinical text data to obtain outcome information necessary for training models. However, if the outcome is rare then simple random sampling results in very few cases and insufficient information to develop accurate classifiers. Since large scale detailed abstraction is often expensive, time-consuming, and not feasible, more efficient strategies are needed. Under such resource constrained settings, we propose a class of enrichment sampling designs, where selection for abstraction is stratified by auxiliary variables related to the true outcome of interest. Stratified sampling on highly specific variables results in targeted samples that are more enriched with cases, which we show translates to increased model discrimination and better statistical learning performance. We provide mathematical details, and simulation evidence that links sampling designs to their resulting prediction model performance. We discuss the impact of our proposed sampling on both model development and validation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed designs for outcome label collection and subsequent machine-learning, using radiology report text data from the Lumbar Imaging with Reporting of Epidemiology (LIRE) study."

Under deterministic spin precessional dynamics, we unveil the full range of quasistationary behavior observed during relaxation to equilibrium, whereby the system is trapped in nonequilibrium states for times that diverge with the system size. The corresponding stochastic dynamics, modeling interaction with the environment and constructed in the spirit of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, however shows a fast relaxation to equilibrium on a size-independent timescale and no signature of quasistationarity, provided the noise is strong enough. Similar fast relaxation is also seen in Glauber Monte Carlo dynamics of the model, thus establishing the ubiquity of what has been reported earlier in particle dynamics (hence distinct from the spin dynamics considered here) of long-range interacting systems, that quasistationarity observed in deterministic dynamics is washed away by fluctuations induced through contact with the environment."

This is because of the potential to remove human experts from the design loop which can reduce costs and decrease time to model deployment. Neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have improved significantly in their computational efficiency since the original NAS was proposed. This reduction in computation is enabled via weight sharing such as in Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). However, recently a body of work confirms our discovery that ENAS does not do significantly better than random search with weight sharing, contradicting the initial claims of the authors. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by investigating the interpretability of the ENAS controller's hidden state. We find models sampled from identical controller hidden states have no correlation with various graph similarity metrics, so no notion of structural similarity is learned. This failure mode implies the RNN controller does not condition on past architecture choices. Lastly, we propose a solution to this failure mode by forcing the controller's hidden state to encode pasts decisions by training it with a memory buffer of previously sampled architectures. Doing this improves hidden state interpretability by increasing the correlation between controller hidden states and graph similarity metrics."

Recently a statistical ensemble of random graphs with a regular block structure, i.e. the ensemble of equitable graphs, has been introduced and analytic results have been derived in the computationally-hard context of graph partitioning and community detection.

The increased need for protein function in different applications requires improvements of measurement systems assessing protein thermodynamics to handle many kinds of samples quickly. We have developed a passive millimeter-wave microscope that allows near-field imaging of thermal radiation, even in the low temperature range under room temperature where passive infrared imaging systems are ineffective. This advantage of our microscope system in combination with low thermal emission property of water ice in the millimeter-wave region enables the characterization of the thermal radiation from the proteins themselves in aqueous solution at a temperature range low enough to freeze water and to trap conformation intermediates in the proteins. Experiments performed at a millimeter-wave frequency of 50 GHz in a temperature range from 130 K to 270 K for a 20 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) aqueous solution showed a displacement between two conformational states of BSA at a temperature of approximately 190 K as a boundary.

We find four sharp resonance states near the $\Sigma_c N$ and $\Sigma^*_c N$ thresholds. From the analysis of the binding energies of partial channel systems, we conclude that these resonance states are Feshbach resonances.

We show that the properties of the D_0 meson can be successfully reproduced as the chiral partner of the D meson coupled with the D pi scattering states.

Here for any real x, x denotes the distance from its nearest integer. The problem of classifying all real algebraic numbers greater than one exhibiting the above phenomenon was suggested by Mahler. This was solved by a beautiful work of Corvaja and Zannier. On the other hand, for non-zero real numbers $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ with $\alpha$ > 1, Hardy about a century ago asked ''In what circumstances can it be true that $\lambda$$\alpha$ n $\rightarrow$ 0 as n $\rightarrow$ $\infty$? '' This question is still open in general. In this note, we study its analogue in the context of the problem of Mahler. We first compare and contrast with what is known visa -vis the original question of Hardy. We then suggest a number of questions that arise as natural consequences of our investigation. Of these questions, we answer one and offer some insight into others."

Weakly guided modes (bare photonic modes) are found through a classical analysis, identifying those lowest-order modes presenting large electromagnetic fields spreading outside the nanowire, while preserving their robust guided behavior. Experimental fits of the dielectric permittivity of an organic dye that exhibits excitonic states are used for realistic scenarios. A quantum model properly confirms through an avoided mode crossing that the strong coupling regime can be achieved for this configuration, leading to Rabi splitting values above 100 meV. In addition, it is shown that the coupling strength depends on the fraction of energy spread outside the nanowire, rather than on the mode field localization. These results open up a new avenue towards strong coupling phenomenology involving propagating modes in non-absorbing media."

In this paper, we introduce a new approach to estimate the part of the effect of the two drugs due to the interaction of the compounds, i.e. which is due to synergistic or antagonistic effects of the two drugs, compared to a reference value representing the condition when the combined compounds do not interact, called zero-interaction. We describe an in-vitro cell viability experiment as a random experiment, by interpreting cell viability as the probability of a cell in the experiment to be viable after treatment, and including information related to different exposure conditions. We propose a flexible Bayesian spline regression framework for modelling the viability surface of two drugs combined as a function of the concentrations. Since the proposed approach is based on a statistical model, it allows to include replicates of the experiments, to evaluate the uncertainty of the estimates, and to perform prediction. We test the model fit and prediction performance on a simulation study, and on an ovarian cancer cell dataset. Posterior estimates of the zero-interaction level and of the synergy term, obtained via adaptive MCMC algorithms, are used to compute interpretable measures of efficacy of the combined experiment, including relative volume under the surface (rVUS) measures to summarise the zero-interaction and synergy terms and a bi-variate alternative to the well-known EC50 measure."

In this theoretical study, a wave-Reynolds number is introduced to characterize general solutions to these modulation equations. This non-dimensional number relates the vertical linear group velocity with wavenumber, pressure scale height and kinematic molecular/eddy viscosity. It is demonstrated by analytic and numerical methods that Lindzen-type waves in the saturation region, i.e. where the wave-Reynolds number is of order unity, destabilize by transient perturbations. It is proposed that this mechanism may be a generator for secondary waves due to direct wave-mean-flow interaction. By assumption the primary waves are exactly such that altitudinal amplitude growth and viscous damping are balanced and by that the amplitude is maximized. Implications of these results on the relation between mean-flow acceleration and wave breaking heights are discussed."

Despite this ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how complex network structures and heterogeneous local dynamics combine to either promote or inhibit synchronization. Moreover, for most real-world applications it is impossible to obtain the exact specifications of the system, and there is a lack of theory for how uncertainty affects synchronization. We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing synchronization, and we provide new perspectives for why synchronization is generically promoted by network properties including degree-frequency correlations, link directedness, and link weight delocalization."

In this note, we consider a more general version of c-vectors defined for arbitrary cluster algebras of geometric type and formulate a conjecture describing their asymptotic behavior. This conjecture, which is called the asymptotic sign coherence conjecture, states that for any infinite sequence of matrix mutations that satisfies certain natural conditions, the corresponding c-vectors eventually become sign coherent. We prove this conjecture for rank 2 cluster algebras of infinite type and for a particular sequence of mutations in a cluster algebra associated with the Markov quiver."

While an interesting class of strategies, the definitions of extortionate strategies are algebraically rigid, apply only to memory-one strategies, and require complete knowledge of a strategy (memory-one cooperation probabilities). We describe a method to detect extortionate behaviour from the history of play of a strategy. When applied to a corpus of 204 strategies this method detects extortionate behaviour in well-known extortionate strategies as well others that do not fit the algebraic definition. The highest performing strategies in this corpus are able to exhibit selectively extortionate behavior, cooperating with strong strategies while exploiting weaker strategies, which no memory-one strategy can do. These strategies emerged from an evolutionary selection process and their existence contradicts widely-repeated folklore in the evolutionary game theory literature: complex strategies can be extraordinarily effective, zero-determinant strategies can be outperformed by non-zero determinant strategies, and longer memory strategies are able to outperform short memory strategies. Moreover, while resistance to extortion is critical for the evolution of cooperation, the extortion of weak opponents need not prevent cooperation between stronger opponents, and this adaptability may be crucial to maintaining cooperation in the long run."

Among the methods used to estimate the degree in which a text expresses a given sentiment, are those based on Gaussian Processes. However, traditional Gaussian Processes methods use a predefined kernel with hyperparameters that can be tuned but whose structure can not be adapted. In this paper, we propose the application of Genetic Programming for evolving Gaussian Process kernels that are more precise for sentiment analysis. We use use a very flexible representation of kernels combined with a multi-objective approach that simultaneously considers two quality metrics and the computational time spent by the kernels. Our results show that the algorithm can outperform Gaussian Processes with traditional kernels for some of the sentiment analysis tasks considered."

The causal diamond geometry is calculated perturbatively using Riemann normal coordinate expansion up to the leading order in both vacuum and non-vacuum. We provide a collection of results including the area of the codimension-two edge, the maximal hypersurface volume and their isoperimetric ratio for each construction, which will be useful for any applications involving the quantitative properties of causal diamonds. In particular, by solving the dynamical equations of the expansion and the shear on the lightcone, we find that intriguingly only the light-cone cut construction yields an area deficit proportional to the Bel-Robinson superenergy density W in four dimensional spacetime, but such a direct connection fails to hold in any other dimension. We also compute the volume of the Alexandrov interval causal diamond in vacuum, which we believe is important but missing from the literatures. Our work complements and extends the earlier works on the causal diamond geometry by Gibbons and Solodukhin, Jacobson, Senovilla and Speranza and others. Some potential applications of our results in mathematical general relativity and quantum gravity are discussed."

Their concurrent conjecture that the two-dimensional AKLT model on the hexagonal lattice is also gapped remains open.

The argument is based on explicitly verifying a finite-size criterion which is tailor-made for the system at hand. We also discuss generalizations of the method to the full hexagonal lattice."

Our analysis shows that the strongest driver of romantic interaction at the national level is simple geographic proximity, but at the local level other demographic factors come into play. We find that dating markets in each city are partitioned into submarkets along lines of age and ethnicity. Sex ratio varies widely between submarkets, with younger submarkets having more men and fewer women than older ones. There is also a noticeable tendency for minorities, especially women, to be younger than the average in older submarkets, and our analysis reveals how this kind of racial stratification arises through the messaging decisions of both men and women. Our study illustrates how network techniques applied to online interactions can reveal the aggregate effects of individual behavior on social structure."

Due to its proximity (780 kpc), M31 can be resolved into individual stars like the Milky Way (MW). Unlike the MW, we have the advantage of a global view of M31, enabling M31 to be observed with techniques that also apply to more distant galaxies. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that M31 may have survived a major merger within the last several Gyr, shaping the morphology of its stellar halo and triggering a starburst, while leaving the stellar disk largely intact. The MW and M31 thus provide complementary opportunities for in-depth studies of the disks, halos, and satellites of L* galaxies.   Our understanding of the M31 system will be transformed in the 2020s if they include wide field facilities for both photometry (HST-like sensitivity and resolution) and spectroscopy (10-m class telescope, >1 sq. deg. field, highly multiplexed, R~ 3000 to 6000). We focus here on the power of these facilities to constrain the past, present, and future merger history of M31, via chemo-dynamical analyses and star formation histories of phase-mixed stars accreted at early times, as well as stars in surviving tidal debris features, M31's extended disk, and intact satellite galaxies that will eventually be tidally incorporated into the halo. This will yield an unprecedented view of the hierarchical formation of the M31 system and the subhalos that built it into the L* galaxy we observe today."

The MUN Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is built to do mapping-type missions of seabeds as well as survey missions. These missions require a great deal of power to reach underwater depths (i.e. 3000 meters). The MUN Explorer uses 11 rechargeable Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries as the main power source with a total capacity of 14.6kWh to 17.952kWh, and the vehicle can run for 10 hours. The draw-backs of operating the existing power system of the MUN Explorer, which was done by the researcher at the Holyrood management facility, include mobilization costs, logistics and transport, and facility access, all of which should be taken into consideration. Recharging the batteries for at least 8 hours is also very challenging and time consuming. To overcome these challenges and run the MUN Explorer for a long time, it is essential to integrate a fuel cell into an existing power system (i.e. battery bank). The integration of the fuel cell not only will increase the system power, but it will also reduce the number of batteries needed as suggested by HOMER software. In this paper, an integrated fuel cell is designed to be added into the MUN Explorer AUV along with a battery bank system to increase its power system. The system sizing is performed using HOMER software. The results from HOMER software show that a 1kW fuel cell and 8 Li-ion batteries can increase the power system capacity to 68 kWh. The dynamic model is then built in MATLAB/Simulink environment to provide a better understanding of the system behavior.The 1kW fuel cell is connected to a DC/DC Boost Converter to increase the output voltage from 24V to 48V as required by the battery and DC motor."

The region is embedded with Darcy-Forchheimer medium which supports permeability. The porous matrix is suspended with nanofluid, and surface is under the influence of inconsistent heat source/sink. Using similarity functions, framed governing equations are switched to a collection of ordinary differential equations. Output is procured via optimal homotopy asymptotic method (OHAM). Basic notion of OHAM for a vector differential set-up is presented along with required convergence theorems. At different flow stagnation strengths, nanofluid behavior is investigated with respect to variations in porosity parameter, Forchheimer number, Brownian motion, stretching ratio, thermophoretic force, heat source/sink and Schimdt number. Stagnation flow strength invert the pattern of boundary layer profiles of primary velocity. Heat transfer has straightforward relation with Forchheimer number when stagnation forces dominate stretching forces"

The improvement comes from the fact that we can account for a richer and finer preference information provided by the decision-makers, which permits a more accurate modelling of the strength of preference between two consecutive levels of a scale. Instead of considering only the number of blank cards between consecutive positions in the ranking of objects such as criteria and scale levels, we consider also the number of blank cards between non consecutive positions in the ranking. This information is collected in a pairwise comparison table that it is not necessarily built with precise values. We can consider also missing information and imprecise information provided in the form of ranges. Since the information provided by the decision-makers is not necessarily consistent, we propose also some procedures to help the decision-maker to make consistent his evaluations in a co-constructive way interacting with an analyst and reflecting and revising her/his judgments. The method is illustrated through and example in which, generalizing the SWING method, interacting criteria are aggregated through the Choquet integral."

To get a deeper insight about CHO, a more generalized form of these quantities with R\'enyi entropy ($R$) is invoked here. The importance of scaling parameter in the exponential part is also investigated. $R$ is estimated considering order of entropic moments $\alpha, \beta$ as $(\frac{2}{3},3)$ in $r$ and $p$ spaces respectively. Explicit results of these measures with respect to variation of confinement radius $r_c$ is provided systematically for first eight energy states, namely, $1s,~1p,~1d,~2s,~1f,~2p,~1g$ and $2d$. Detailed analysis of these complexity measures provides many hitherto unreported interesting features."

A departure from the widely studied setting of classical phylogenetics, where trees are leaf-labelled, tumoral trees are fully labelled, i.e., \emph{every} vertex has a label.   In this paper we provide a rearrangement distance measure between two fully-labelled trees. This notion originates from two operations: one which modifies the topology of the tree, the other which permutes the labels of the vertices, hence leaving the topology unaffected. While we show that the distance between two trees in terms of each such operation alone can be decided in polynomial time, the more general notion of distance when both operations are allowed is NP-hard to decide. Despite this result, we show that it is fixed-parameter tractable, and we give a 4-approximation algorithm when one of the trees is binary."

A Gaussian free field is a spin system that takes values in Euclidean space, and this article generalises the classical isomorphism theorems to spin systems taking values in hyperbolic and spherical geometries. The corresponding random walks are no longer Markovian: they are the vertex-reinforced and vertex-diminished jump processes. We also investigate supersymmetric versions of these formulas.   Our proofs are based on exploiting the continuous symmetries of the corresponding spin systems. The classical isomorphism theorems use the translation symmetry of Euclidean space, while in hyperbolic and spherical geometries the relevant symmetries are Lorentz boosts and rotations, respectively. These very short proofs are new even in the Euclidean case.   Isomorphism theorems are useful tools, and to illustrate this we present several applications. These include simple proofs of exponential decay for spin system correlations, exact formulas for the resolvents of the joint processes of random walks together with their local times, and a new derivation of the Sabot--Tarres formula for the limiting local time of the vertex-reinforced jump process."

Our investigations are based on a specialized simulation technique which faithfully takes into account the hydrodynamic interactions of the surrounding, Newtonian solvent. We find that the combination of magnetic field (including both strength and direction) and shear rate controls the mean number of magnetic clusters, which in turn is largely responsible for the static and dynamic behavior. While some properties are similar to comparable non-magnetic star polymers, others exhibit novel phenomena; examples of the latter include the breakup and reorganization of the clusters beyond a critical shear rate, and a strong dependence of the efficiency with which shear rate is translated into whole-body rotations on the direction of the magnetic field."

Calibration-the idea that a model's predicted probabilities of outcomes reflect true probabilities of those outcomes-formalizes this notion. While analyzing the calibration of deep neural networks, we've identified core problems with the way calibration is currently measured. We design the Thresholded Adaptive Calibration Error (TACE) metric to resolve these pathologies and show that it outperforms other metrics, especially in settings where predictions beyond the maximum prediction that is chosen as the output class matter. There are many cases where what a practitioner cares about is the calibration of a specific prediction, and so we introduce a dynamic programming based Prediction Specific Calibration Error (PSCE) that smoothly considers the calibration of nearby predictions to give an estimate of the calibration error of a specific prediction."

Defying this intuition, this paper develops a framework that allows the disclosure of collective properties of datasets without compromising the privacy of individual data samples. We present an algorithm to build an optimal disclosure strategy/mapping, and discuss it fundamental limits on finite and asymptotically large datasets. Furthermore, we present explicit expressions to the asymptotic performance of this scheme in some scenarios, and study cases where our approach attains maximal efficiency. We finally discuss suboptimal schemes to provide sample privacy guarantees to large datasets with a reduced computational cost."

These maximizing paths and their energies may be viewed via a coordinate system that respects these scalings. What emerges by doing so is a system indexed by $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$ with $s < t$ of unit order quantities $W_n\big( x,s ; y,t \big)$ specifying the scaled energy of the maximizing path that moves in scaled coordinates between $(x,s)$ and $(y,t)$. The space-time Airy sheet is, after a parabolic adjustment, the putative distributional limit $W_\infty$ of this system as $n \to \infty$. The Airy sheet has recently been constructed in [15] as such a limit of Brownian last passage percolation. In this article, we initiate the study of fractal geometry in the Airy sheet. We prove that the scaled energy difference profile given by $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}: z \to W_\infty \big( 1,0 ; z,1 \big) - W_\infty \big( -1,0 ; z,1 \big)$ is a non-decreasing process that is constant in a random neighbourhood of almost every $z \in \mathbb{R}$; and that the exceptional set of $z \in \mathbb{R}$ that violate this condition almost surely has Hausdorff dimension one-half. Points of violation correspond to special behaviour for scaled maximizing paths, and we prove the result by investigating this behaviour, making use of two inputs from recent studies of scaled Brownian LPP; namely, Brownian regularity of profiles, and estimates on the rarity of pairs of disjoint scaled maximizing paths that begin and end close to each other."

Solving this kind of combinatorial optimization problem is a very difficult problem in computational science, and quantum computing is expected to play an important role in this field. In this article, we propose a method and obtained specific formulas to find solutions for tetromino tiling puzzles using a quantum annealer. In addition, we evaluated these formulas using a simulator and using actual hardware DW2000Q."

However, most computational affect recognition (AR) approaches examine ads via the text modality, and only limited work has been devoted to decoding ad emotions from audiovisual or user cues. This work (1) compiles an affective ad dataset capable of evoking coherent emotions across users; (2) explores the efficacy of content-centric convolutional neural network (CNN) features for AR vis-\~a-vis handcrafted audio-visual descriptors; (3) examines user-centric ad AR from Electroencephalogram (EEG) responses acquired during ad-viewing, and (4) demonstrates how better affect predictions facilitate effective computational advertising as determined by a study involving 18 users. Experiments reveal that (a) CNN features outperform audiovisual descriptors for content-centric AR; (b) EEG features are able to encode ad-induced emotions better than content-based features; (c) Multi-task learning performs best among a slew of classification algorithms to achieve optimal AR, and (d) Pursuant to (b), EEG features also enable optimized ad insertion onto streamed video, as compared to content-based or manual insertion techniques in terms of ad memorability and overall user experience."

This problem finds numerous applications on large-scale graphs. Recently, heat kernel PageRank (HKPR), which is a measure of the proximity of nodes in graphs, is applied to this problem and found to be more efficient compared with prior methods. However, existing solutions for computing HKPR either are prohibitively expensive or provide unsatisfactory error approximation on HKPR values, rendering them impractical especially on billion-edge graphs.   In this paper, we present TEA and TEA+, two novel local graph clustering algorithms based on HKPR, to address the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, these algorithms provide non-trivial theoretical guarantees in relative error of HKPR values and the time complexity. The basic idea is to utilize deterministic graph traversal to produce a rough estimation of exact HKPR vector, and then exploit Monte-Carlo random walks to refine the results in an optimized and non-trivial way. In particular, TEA+ offers practical efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial optimizations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TEA+ outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by more than four times on most benchmark datasets in terms of computational time when achieving the same clustering quality, and in particular, is an order of magnitude faster on large graphs including the widely studied Twitter and Friendster datasets."

From the viewpoint of combinatorial Hodge theory, it is natural to ask whether these functions are ""strictly"" log-concave for simple matroids. In this paper, we show this strictness for simple graphic matroids, that is, we show that Kirchhoff polynomials of simple graphs are strictly log-concave. Our key observation is that the Kirchhoff polynomial {of a complete graph} can be seen as the (irreducible) relative invariant of a certain prehomogeneous vector space, which may be independently interesting in its own right. Furthermore, we prove that for any $a_i\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_n\in R^1_{M}$ satisfies the strong Lefschetz property (moreover, Hodge--Riemann bilinear relation) at degree one of the Artinian Gorenstein algebra $R^*_M$ associated to a graphic matroid $M$, which is defined by Maeno and Numata for all matroids."

However, they usually ignore the correlation between multiple instances, which is also valuable for knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a new framework named correlation congruence for knowledge distillation (CCKD), which transfers not only the instance-level information, but also the correlation between instances. Furthermore, a generalized kernel method based on Taylor series expansion is proposed to better capture the correlation between instances. Empirical experiments and ablation studies on image classification tasks (including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K) and metric learning tasks (including ReID and Face Recognition) show that the proposed CCKD substantially outperforms the original KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared with other SOTA KD-based methods. The CCKD can be easily deployed in the majority of the teacher-student framework such as KD and hint-based learning methods."

In spite of advances in photogrammetry, remote sensing and computer vision, this task remains challenging due to object and data complexity. The development of object extraction approaches is promoted through publically available benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks. Many aspects of performance evaluation have already been studied. This study collects the best practices from literature, puts the various aspects in one evaluation framework, and demonstrates its usefulness to a case study on mapping object outlines. The evaluation framework includes five dimensions: the robustness to changes in resolution, input, location, parameters, and application. Examples for investigating these dimensions are provided, as well as accuracy measures for their qualitative analysis. The measures consist of time efficiency and a procedure for line-based accuracy assessment regarding quantitative completeness and spatial correctness. The delineation approach to which the evaluation framework is applied, was previously introduced and is substantially improved in this study."

Numerically solving the linearized Eliashberg equation for the superconducting (SC) gap function with the random phase approximation, we systematically examine both singlet and triplet SC gap functions with possible pairing symmetries and the parameter dependence of the superconductivity. For the realistic SOC $\lambda$ and Hund's coupling $J/U$ relevant to Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, namely, for a large $\lambda$ and small $J/U$ region, we find that the intra-band antiferromagnetic (AF) pseudospin $\bm{j}_{\text{eff}} = -\bm{l}+\bm{s}$ fluctuations favor a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pseudospin $j_{\text{eff}}=1/2$ singlet pairing in the electron-doping. We also find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is more stabilized with increasing the SOC and decreasing the Hund's coupling. Furthermore, we show for a small $\lambda$ and large $J/U$ region that an $s_{\pm}$-wave singlet pairing is favored in the hole-doped region. The origin of the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing is due to the inter-band pair scattering arising from the intra-orbital AF spin $\bm s$ fluctuations. Although the possibility of a pseudospin triplet pairing is considered, we find it always unfavorable for all parameters studied here. The experimental consequences for other strongly correlated materials with a large SOC are also discussed."

This work builds upon a beautiful recent experiment by Urtecho et al. who measured the gene expression of over 10,000 promoters spanning all possible combinations of a small set of regulatory elements. Using this data, we demonstrate that a central claim in energy matrix models of gene expression - that each promoter element contributes independently and additively to gene expression - contradicts experimental measurements. We propose that a key missing ingredient from such models is the avidity between the -35 and -10 RNA polymerase binding sites and develop what we call a refined energy matrix model that incorporates this effect. We show that this the refined energy matrix model can characterize the full suite of gene expression data and explore several applications of this framework, namely, how multivalent binding at the -35 and -10 sites can buffer RNAP kinetics against mutations and how promoters that bind overly tightly to RNA polymerase can inhibit gene expression. The success of our approach suggests that avidity represents a key physical principle governing the interaction of RNA polymerase to its promoter."

After decoupling it condensates to super-structures with cosmic voids similar to current picture of the universe. With the help of the equation of state of dry foam (equivalently a fluid with voids in it) from fluid mechanics it is possible to show that tension within these cosmic walls due to their binding interaction may cause accelerated expansion in the absence of dark energy."

The optical spectra of the molecular semiconductors are difficult to solve an model from first-principles because (i) the very large number of atoms in a unit cell and (ii) the accurate theoretical excited state is still under development. Here we present a tight-binding model of an exciton band structure in a molecular chain. We take into account the intra-molecule and charge-transfer excitation within a molecular dimer in a unit cell, then we apply the tight-binding model by including the coupling between two types of excitations. We not only found that our calculations can explain a body of UV-Vis optical spectra of transition-metal phthalocyanines, but also a one-dimensional excitonic topological band structure if we fine-tune the couplings in a dimerized molecular chain. We have found a large space to obtain the topological Zak phase in the parameter space, in which there is a simple linear relationship between the hopping integrals between cells and within cell."

For semantic segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real ""target domain"" data models that are trained on annotated images from a different ""source domain"", notably a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain. As a result, the performance of the trained semantic segmentation model on the target domain is boosted. Our novel approach indeed achieves state-of-the-art performance on different challenging synthetic-2-real benchmarks."

Smartphones harbor sensor and personal context data that can be used for user profiling. Yet, one vast source of personal data, that is text messaging data, has hardly been studied for user profiling. We see three reasons for this: First, private text messaging data is not shared due to their intimate character. Second, the definition of an appropriate privacy-preserving similarity measure is non-trivial. Third, assessing the quality of a similarity measure on text messaging data representing a potentially infinite set of topics is non-trivial. In order to overcome these obstacles we propose affinity, a system that assesses the similarity between text messaging histories of users reliably and efficiently in a privacy-preserving manner. Private texting data stays on user devices and data for comparison is compared in a latent format that neither allows to reconstruct the comparison words nor any original private plain text. We evaluate our approach by calculating similarities between Twitter histories of 60 US senators. The resulting similarity network reaches an average 85.0% accuracy on a political party classification task."

The animation is driven by human interpretable control signals consisting of head pose angles and the Action Unit (AU) values. The control information can be obtained from multiple sources including external driving videos and manual controls. Due to the interpretable nature of the driving signal, one can easily mix the information between multiple sources (e.g. pose from one image and expression from another) and apply selective post-production editing. The proposed face animator is implemented as a two-stage neural network model that is learned in a self-supervised manner using a large video collection. The proposed Interpretable and Controllable face reenactment network (ICface) is compared to the state-of-the-art neural network-based face animation techniques in multiple tasks. The results indicate that ICface produces better visual quality while being more versatile than most of the comparison methods. The introduced model could provide a lightweight and easy to use tool for a multitude of advanced image and video editing tasks."

In our calculations, we employed the $\Lambda^*\Lambda^*$ interaction compatible with the $\Lambda^*\Lambda^*$ binding energy $B_{\Lambda^*\Lambda^*}=40$~MeV given by the phenomenological energy-independent $\bar{K}N$ interaction model by Yamazaki and Akaishi (YA). We found that the binding energy per $\Lambda^*$, as well as the central density in $\Lambda^*$ many-body systems saturates for mass number $A\geq120$, leaving $\Lambda^*$ aggregates highly unstable against strong interaction decay. Moreover, we confronted the YA interaction model with kaonic atom data and found that it fails to reproduce the $K^-$ single-nucleon absorption fractions at rest from bubble chamber experiments."

The stress-strain behavior obtained from both techniques are in excellent agreement. Variation of the layer thickness in simulations reveals an increase of the strength with decreasing layer thickness. Pillars fail through the formation of shear bands whose nucleation we trace back to the existence of surface flaws. Our combined approach demonstrates the crucial role of contact geometry in controlling the deformation mode and suggests that modulus-matched nanolaminates should be able to suppress strain localization while maintaining controllable strength.

An anomalous moment found to persist above the Curie temperature of the La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ films is not attributed to the films, but to oxygen vacancies at or near the surface of the substrate. The contribution to the moment from the substrate is as high as 20 $\mu$B/nm$^2$ in the case of STO or LSAT. The effect is increased by adding an STO cap layer. Taking this d-zero magnetism into account, extrapolated magnetic dead layer thicknesses of 0.8 nm, 1.5 nm and 3.0 nm are found for the manganite films grown on LSAT, STO and LAO substrates, respectively. An STO cap layer eliminates the LSMO dead layer."

The stream, previously identified in deep Large Binocular Telescope images as a diffuse low surface brightness structure, is resolved into individual stars in the F606W (broad V) and F814W ($\sim$I) images acquired with the Wide Field Camera 3. The resulting V, I color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the resolved stars is dominated by old (age$\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr) red giant branch (RGB) stars. From the observed RGB tip, we conclude that the stream is at the same distance as DDO 68, confirming the physical association with it. A synthetic CMD analysis indicates that the large majority of the star formation activity in the stream occurred at epochs earlier than $\sim$1 Gyr ago, and that the star formation at epochs more recent than $\sim$500 Myr ago is compatible with zero. The total stellar mass of the stream is $\sim10^{6} M_{\odot}$, about 1/100 of that of DDO~68. This is a striking example of hierarchical merging in action at the dwarf galaxy scales."

The 39.3 nm films deposited on (100) MgO substrates exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy due to a small 1% tetragonal elongation induced by substrate strain. The main change on annealing is a modification in the compensation temperature, which first increases from 50 K for the as-deposited film to 185 K after annealing at 250 degree Celsius, and then falls to 140 K after annealing at 400 degree Celsius. There are minor changes in the atomic order, coercivity, resistivity and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), but the net magnetization measured by SQUID magnetometry with the field applied in-plane or perpendicular-to-the-plane changes more significantly. It saturates at 20 to 30 kA/m at room temperature, and a small soft component is seen in the perpendicular SQUID loops which is absent in the square AHE hysteresis loops. This is explained by the half-metallic nature of the compound; the AHE probes only the 4c Mn sublattice that provides the spin-polarized electrons at the Fermi level, whereas the SQUID measures the sum of the oppositely-aligned 4c and 4a sublattice magnetisations."

Typically, this structure is inferred based only on a binary network representing the presence or absence of interactions between nodes, which limits the amount of information that can be extracted from the data. In practice, many interaction networks contain much more information about the relationship between two nodes. For example, in an email network, the volume of communication between two users and the content of that communication can give us information about both the strength and the nature of their relationship.   In this paper, we propose the Topic Blockmodel, a stochastic blockmodel that uses a count-based topic model to capture the interaction modalities within and between latent communities. By explicitly incorporating information sent between nodes in our network representation, we are able to address questions of interest in real-world situations, such as predicting recipients for an email message or inferring the content of an unopened email. Further, by considering topics associated with a pair of communities, we are better able to interpret the nature of each community and the manner in which it interacts with other communities."

Its worst-case hardness lies at the core of computational complexity theory, for example in the form of NP-hardness and the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis. In practice however, SAT instances can often be solved efficiently. This contradicting behavior has spawned interest in the average-case analysis of SAT and has triggered the development of sophisticated rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures.   Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, most theoretical work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. In contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable occurrence. This can be modeled by a non-uniform distribution of the variables, which can result in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.   We study satisfiability thresholds of non-uniform random $2$-SAT with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses and with an arbitrary probability distribution $(p_i)_{i\in[n]}$ with $p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \ldots \ge p_n > 0$ over the n variables. We show for $p_1^2=\Theta(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ that the asymptotic satisfiability threshold is at $m=\Theta( (1-\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)/(p_1\cdot(\sum_{i=2}^n p_i^2)^{1/2}) )$ and that it is coarse. For $p_1^2=o(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ we show that there is a sharp satisfiability threshold at $m=(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)^{-1}$. This result generalizes the seminal works by Chvatal and Reed [FOCS 1992] and by Goerdt [JCSS 1996]."

We depict a linear-time algorithm the receiver can use to determine the minimum amount of information to be requested from the sender in order to repair all transmission errors. Repairs may possibly occur over several cycles of emissions and requests. We show that the expected bandwidth use on the backward channel by our protocol is asymptotically small. In most configurations we give the explicit asymptotic expansion for said expectation. This is obtained by linking our problem to a well known algorithmic problem on a gadget graph, feedback edge set. The little use of the backward channel makes our protocol suitable where one could otherwise simply use backward error correction, e.g. TCP, but where overly using the backward channel is undesirable. We confront our protocol to numerical analysis versus TCP protocol. In most cases our protocol allows to reduce the number of iterations down to 60%, while requiring only negligibly more packages."

These malware are continuously growing and are also used for military espionage, disrupting the industry, power grids, etc. To detect these malware, traditional signature matching techniques are widely used. However, such strategies are not capable to detect the advanced Android malicious apps because malware developer uses several obfuscation techniques. Hence, researchers are continuously addressing the security issues in the Android based smart devices. Therefore, in this paper using Drebin benchmark malware dataset we experimentally demonstrate how to improve the detection accuracy by analyzing the apps after grouping the collected data based on the permissions and achieved 97.15% overall average accuracy.

By adaptively allocating samples based on posterior structure, Dynamic Nested Sampling has the benefits of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms that focus exclusively on posterior estimation while retaining Nested Sampling's ability to estimate evidences and sample from complex, multi-modal distributions. We provide an overview of Nested Sampling, its extension to Dynamic Nested Sampling, the algorithmic challenges involved, and the various approaches taken to solve them. We then examine dynesty's performance on a variety of toy problems along with several astronomical applications. We find in particular problems dynesty can provide substantial improvements in sampling efficiency compared to popular MCMC approaches in the astronomical literature. More detailed statistical results related to Nested Sampling are also included in the Appendix."

However, several processing challenges related to organic contamination at the interfaces of the 2D material and the gate oxide must be overcome to realize robust devices with high yield. Here, we demonstrate an optimized process to realize high-performance field-effect transistor (FET) arrays from large-area (~5000 um2) monolayer MoS2 with a yield of 85 %. A central element of this process is an exposed material forming gas anneal (EM-FGA) that results in uniform FET performance metrics (i.e., field-effect mobilities, threshold voltages, and contact performance). Complementary analytical measurements show that the EM-FGA process reduces deleterious channel doping effects by decreasing organic contamination, while also reducing the prevalence of insulating molybdenum oxide, effectively improving the MoS2-gate oxide interface. The uniform FET performance metrics and high device yield achieved by applying the EM-FGA technique on large-area 2D material flakes will help advance the fabrication of complex 2D nanoelectronics devices and demonstrates the need for improved engineering of the 2D material-gate oxide interface."

However, when users of a road network choose their routes selfishly, the resulting traffic configuration may be very inefficient. Because of this, we consider how to influence human decisions so as to decrease congestion on these roads. We consider a network of parallel roads with two modes of transportation: (i) human drivers who will choose the quickest route available to them, and (ii) ride hailing service which provides an array of autonomous vehicle ride options, each with different prices, to users. In this work, we seek to design these prices so that when autonomous service users choose from these options and human drivers selfishly choose their resulting routes, road usage is maximized and transit delay is minimized. To do so, we formalize a model of how autonomous service users make choices between routes with different price/delay values. Developing a preference-based algorithm to learn the preferences of the users, and using a vehicle flow model related to the Fundamental Diagram of Traffic, we formulate a planning optimization to maximize a social objective and demonstrate the benefit of the proposed routing and learning scheme."

We compute the leading asymptotics of the probability that a large random $d$-regular graph has at least $c \cdot T_{\max}$ triangles, and provide a strong structural description of such graphs.   When $d$ is fixed, we show that such graphs typically consist of many disjoint $d+1$-cliques and an almost triangle-free part. When $d$ is allowed to grow with $n$, we show that such graphs typically consist of $d+o(d)$ sized almost cliques together with an almost triangle-free part."

Each site can either be vacant or occupied by individuals of species $A$ and/or $B$. Multiple occupancy by the same species at a single site is prohibited. The name symbiotic comes from the fact that if only one species is present at a site then that particle dies with rate 1 but if both species are present then the death rate is reduced to $\mu \le 1$ for each particle at that site. We show the critical birth rate $\lambda_c(\mu)$ for weak survival is of order $\sqrt{\mu}$ as $\mu \to 0$. Mean-field calculations predict that when $\mu < 1/2$ there is a discontinuous transition as $\lambda$ is varied. In contrast, we show that, in any dimension, the phase transition is continuous. To be fair to physicists the paper that introduced the model, the authors say that the symbiotic contact process is in the directed percolation universality class and hence has a continuous transition. However, a 2018 paper asserts that the transition is discontinuous above the upper critical dimension, which is 4 for oriented percolation."

We find that these datasets exhibit biases that allow methods that ignore relationships to perform relatively well. We also describe several other problems with the IRSG dataset, and report on experiments using a subset of the dataset in which the biases and other problems are removed. Our studies contribute to a more general effort: that of better understanding what machine learning methods that combine language and vision actually learn and what popular datasets actually test."

The goal of this paper is to present two independent proofs that are purely combinatorial and generalise in various directions, such as to the setting of stuffed maps and hypermaps.

Given $n$ $d$-dimensional data points, the state-of-the-art (and optimal) classical algorithm for training classifiers with constant margin runs in $\tilde{O}(n+d)$ time. We design sublinear quantum algorithms for the same task running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} +\sqrt{d})$ time, a quadratic improvement in both $n$ and $d$. Moreover, our algorithms use the standard quantization of the classical input and generate the same classical output, suggesting minimal overheads when used as subroutines for end-to-end applications. We also demonstrate a tight lower bound (up to poly-log factors) and discuss the possibility of implementation on near-term quantum machines. As a side result, we also give sublinear quantum algorithms for approximating the equilibria of $n$-dimensional matrix zero-sum games with optimal complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{n})$."

A cloud infrastructure with portable software tools can provide much needed resources enabling faster processing of much larger datasets than would be possible at any individual lab. The PhenoMeNal project has developed such an infrastructure, allowing users to run analyses on local or commercial cloud platforms. We have examined the computational scaling behaviour of the PhenoMeNal platform using four different implementations across 1-1000 virtual CPUs using two common metabolomics tools.   Results: Our results show that data which takes up to 4 days to process on a standard desktop computer can be processed in just 10 min on the largest cluster. Improved runtimes come at the cost of decreased efficiency, with all platforms falling below 80% efficiency above approximately 1/3 of the maximum number of vCPUs. An economic analysis revealed that running on large scale cloud platforms is cost effective compared to traditional desktop systems.   Conclusions: Overall, cloud implementations of PhenoMeNal show excellent scalability for standard metabolomics computing tasks on a range of platforms, making them a compelling choice for research computing in metabolomics."

Group formation experiments avoid this problem by randomly assigning individuals to groups and observing their responses; for example, do first-year students have better grades when they are randomly assigned roommates who have stronger academic backgrounds? Standard approaches for analyzing these experiments, however, are heavily model-dependent and generally fail to exploit the randomized design. In this paper, we extend methods from randomization-based testing under interference to group formation experiments. The proposed tests are justified by the randomization itself, require relatively few assumptions, and are exact in finite samples. First, we develop procedures that yield valid tests for arbitrary group formation designs. Second, we derive sufficient conditions on the design such that the randomization test can be implemented via simple random permutations. We apply this approach to two recent group formation experiments."

Our non-local game is inspired by the three-player non-local game of Ji, Leung and Vidick [arXiv:1802.04926]. It reduces the number of players from three to two, as well as the question and answer set sizes.

Gaz. 47 (1963)] proved that every tournament on $n$ vertices has a directed dominating set of at most $\log (n+1)$ vertices, where $\log$ is the logarithm to base $2$. He also showed that there is a tournament on $n$ vertices with no directed domination set of cardinality less than $\log n - 2 \log \log n + 1$. This notion of directed domination number has been generalized to arbitrary graphs by Caro and Henning in [Directed domination in oriented graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. (2012) 160:7--8.]. However, the generalization to directed r-uniform hypergraphs seems to be rare. Among several results, we prove the following upper and lower bounds on $\overrightarrow{\Gamma}_{r-1}(H(n,r))$, the upper directed $(r-1)$-domination number of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices $H(n,r)$, which is the main theorem of this paper: \[c (\ln n)^{\frac{1}{r-1}} \le \overrightarrow{\Gamma}_{r-1}(H(n,r)) \le C \ln n,\] where $r$ is a positive integer and $c= c(r) > 0$ and $C = C(r) > 0$ are constants depending on $r$."

Using Schwinger-DeWitt proper time formalism, we calculate the vacuum expectation value $<\phi^{2}>$, when the Compton length of the quantum field is much less than the characteristic radius of the curvature of the background geometry, and we can ignore nonlocal contributions. Explicit analytic expressions are obtained for a general curvature coupling parameter, and specified to the more physical cases of minimal and conformal coupling. Comparing the leading term of $<\phi^{2}>$, proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $a_{2}$, with higher order terms, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $a_{5}$, we conclude that the next to next to next to leading approximation need to be used to give a more precise description of vacuum polarization effects in this structures. We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation."

Each receiver demands a unique message and has some side-information. Weakly secure index coding problem is a practical version of the index coding problem in the presence of an eavesdropper. The eavesdropper can not gain any information about the messages he does not have, by listening to the senders' transmissions. We provide constructions of weakly secure linear codes for different classes of the two-sender unicast index coding problem, using those of its sub-problems. The constructions are valid only if such codes exist for all the sub-problems under consideration. We identify some classes of the two-sender problem, where the constructions provide optimal weakly secure linear index codes."

One reason this is difficult is the challenge of learning accurate models of an environment. If such a model is inaccurate, the agent's plans and actions will likely be sub-optimal, and likely lead to the wrong outcomes. Recent progress in model-based reinforcement learning has improved the ability for agents to learn and use predictive models. In this paper, we extend a recent deep learning architecture which learns a predictive model of the environment that aims to predict only the value of a few key measurements, which are be indicative of an agent's performance. Predicting only a few measurements rather than the entire future state of an environment makes it more feasible to learn a valuable predictive model. We extend this predictive model with a small, evolving neural network that suggests the best goals to pursue in the current state. We demonstrate that this allows the predictive model to transfer to new scenarios where goals are different, and that the adaptive goals can even adjust agent behavior on-line, changing its strategy to fit the current context."

We consider a fast-rolling relaxion field, which can go over the bumps created by QCD-like dynamics. Then, in one of the mechanisms, we stop it with a parametric resonance of the Higgs field. The mechanisms are free from a super-Planckian field excursion or a gigantic number of e-folds of inflation. The relaxion has a mass around the weak scale and mixes with the Higgs boson, which enhances the testability of our mechanisms."

However, challenges such as occlusion and view change remain obstacles in real world deployment. A natural solution to these challenges is to use multiple cameras with multiview inputs, though existing systems are mostly limited to specific targets (e.g. human), static cameras, and/or camera calibration. To break through these limitations, we propose a generic multiview tracking (GMT) framework that allows camera movement, while requiring neither specific object model nor camera calibration. A key innovation in our framework is a cross-camera trajectory prediction network (TPN), which implicitly and dynamically encodes camera geometric relations, and hence addresses missing target issues such as occlusion. Moreover, during tracking, we assemble information across different cameras to dynamically update a novel collaborative correlation filter (CCF), which is shared among cameras to achieve robustness against view change. The two components are integrated into a correlation filter tracking framework, where the features are trained offline using existing single view tracking datasets. For evaluation, we first contribute a new generic multiview tracking dataset (GMTD) with careful annotations, and then run experiments on GMTD and the PETS2009 datasets. On both datasets, the proposed GMT algorithm shows clear advantages over state-of-the-art ones."

It does not take into account magnetic interactions, retardation effects, and radiation losses. Magnetic interactions play a dominant role in the scattering from dielectric nanoparticles. The retardation effects play a fundamental role in the coupling of the modes with the incident radiation and in determining their radiative strength; their exclusion may lead to erroneous predictions of the excited modes and of the scattered power spectra. Radiation losses may lead to a significant broadening of the scattering resonances. We propose a hybridization theory for non-hermitian composite systems based on the full-Maxwell equations that, overcoming all the limitations of the plasmon hybridization theory, unlocks the description of dielectric dimers. As an example, we decompose the scattered field from silicon and silver dimers, under different excitation conditions and gap-sizes, in terms of dimer modes, pinpointing the hybridizing isolated-sphere modes behind them."

We use a coupled first-order symmetric stress-velocity formulation. Careful attention is directed at (a) the derivation of an energy-stable penalty-based numerical flux, which offers high-order accuracy in presence of material discontinuities, and (b) proper treatment of micro-heterogeneities (sub-element variations) in the numerical scheme. The use of a penalty-based numerical flux avoids the diagonalization of Jacobian matrices into polarized wave constituents necessary when solving element-wise Riemann problems. Micro-heterogeneities are accurately and stably incorporated in the numerical scheme using easily-invertible weight-adjusted mass matrices. The convergence of the proposed numerical scheme is proven and verified by using convergence studies against analytical plane wave solutions. The proposed method is also compared against an existing implementation using the spectral element method to solve the poroelastic wave equation."

When scanning the temporal delay between our 130 fs long signal- and pump pulses, we observe a RIN minimum with a 3 dB width of 20 fs delay and an RIN increase of 20 dB in 40 fs delay at the edges of this minimum. We also demonstrate active long-term stabilization of the mid-infrared frequency comb source to the temporal overlap setting corresponding to the lowest RIN operation point by an on-line RIN-detector and active feedback control of the pump-signal- pulse delay. This active stabilization set-up allowed us to dramatically increase the signal-to-noise ratio of mid-infrared absorption spectra."

A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss functions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the approaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic similarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric, we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks, including CARS196, CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10, our DSML has shown its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we extend our SNR distance metric to deep hashing learning, and conduct experiments on two benchmarks, including CIFAR10 and NUS-WIDE, to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our SNR distance metric."

The theorem applies to the ground state and to the thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature, irrespective of the details of the Hamiltonian as far as all terms in the Hamiltonian are finite ranged. In this work we present a simple yet rigorous proof for general lattice models. For large but finite systems, we find that both the discussion and the conclusion are sensitive to the boundary condition one assumes: under the periodic boundary condition, one can only prove that the current expectation value is inversely proportional to the linear dimension of the system, while the current expectation value completely vanishes before taking the thermodynamic limit when the open boundary condition is imposed. We also provide simple tight-binding models that clarify the limitation of the theorem in dimensions higher than one."

And yet, the formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least 4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints --- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties. We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13 additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9 others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions, supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a total of 50 binary systems (100 stars)."

Here we present a deep learning model capable of performing triage and vetting on TESS candidates. Our model is modified from an existing neural network designed to automatically classify Kepler candidates, and is the first neural network to be trained and tested on real TESS data. In triage mode, our model can distinguish transit-like signals (planet candidates and eclipsing binaries) from stellar variability and instrumental noise with an average precision (the weighted mean of precisions over all classification thresholds) of 97.0% and an accuracy of 97.4%. In vetting mode, the model is trained to identify only planet candidates with the help of newly added scientific domain knowledge, and achieves an average precision of 69.3% and an accuracy of 97.8%. We apply our model on new data from Sector 6, and present 288 new signals that received the highest scores in triage and vetting and were also identified as planet candidates by human vetters. We also provide a homogeneously classified set of TESS candidates suitable for future training."

Recent research has applied sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models to this task, focusing largely on training-time improvements via reinforcement learning and memory augmentation. One of the main problems with applying generic Seq2Seq models for simplification is that these models tend to copy directly from the original sentence, resulting in outputs that are relatively long and complex. We aim to alleviate this issue through the use of two main techniques. First, we incorporate content word complexities, as predicted with a leveled word complexity model, into our loss function during training. Second, we generate a large set of diverse candidate simplifications at test time, and rerank these to promote fluency, adequacy, and simplicity. Here, we measure simplicity through a novel sentence complexity model. These extensions allow our models to perform competitively with state-of-the-art systems while generating simpler sentences. We report standard automatic and human evaluation metrics."

The total cross sections are determined at incident energies ranging from 1.09 to 1.15 GeV. The 1/2 and 3/2 spin-averaged scattering length $a_{\omega p}$ and effective range $r_{\omega p}$ between the $\omega$ meson and proton are estimated from the shape of the total cross section as a function of the incident photon energy: $a_{\omega p} = \left(-0.97^{+0.16_{\rm stat}}_{-0.16_{\rm stat}}{}^{+0.03_{\rm syst}}_{-0.00_{\rm syst}}\right)+i \left(0.07^{+0.15_{\rm stat}}_{-0.14_{\rm stat}}{}^{+0.17_{\rm syst}}_{-0.09_{\rm syst}}\right)$ fm and $r_{\omega p}=\left(+2.78^{+0.68_{\rm stat}}_{-0.54_{\rm stat}}{}^{+0.11_{\rm syst}}_{-0.13_{\rm syst}}\right)+i\left(-0.01^{+0.46_{\rm stat}}_{-0.50_{\rm stat}}{}^{+0.07_{\rm syst}}_{-0.00_{\rm syst}}\right)$ fm, resulting in a repulsive force.

This includes bilayer states in GaAs, several half-integer plateaus in ZnO-based heterostructures, and quantum Hall liquids in graphene. In all cases, Cooper pairing of composite fermions is believed to explain the plateaus. The nature of Cooper pairing and the topological order on those plateaus are hotly debated. Different orders are believed to be present in different systems. This makes it important to understand experimental signatures of all proposed orders. We review the expected experimental signatures for all possible composite-fermion states at half-integer filling. We address Mach-Zehnder interferometry, thermal transport, tunneling experiments, and Fabry-P\'{e}rot interferometry. For this end, we introduce a uniform description of the topological orders of Kitaev's sixteenfold way in terms of their wave-functions, effective Hamiltonians, and edge theories."

Three sections of a mechanics physics course taught at a Chilean University in Coquimbo were investigated. Each section had a weekly problem-solving session using different sets of well and/or ill-structured problems (i.e., algebra-based and open-ended problems respectively), as well as instructional strategies for guiding the problem-solving sessions. Data was collected on networks of information seeking and perceptions of good physics students, during a problem-solving session. We used social network analysis (SNA) for constructing variables while conducting the study. Results suggest that the teaching and learning strategies to guide problem-solving of well and ill-structured problems yield different levels of social interaction among classmates, and significant levels of activity in seeking out information for learning and problem-solving. While strategies for guiding problem-solving lend to significant differences for network connectivity, well and ill-structured physics problems predict similar levels of social activity."

The present work develops a randomized approach to detecting such perturbations based on minimum uncertainty metrics that rely on sampling at the hidden layers during the DNN inference stage. The sampling probabilities are designed for effective detection of the adversarially corrupted inputs. Being modular, the novel detector of adversaries can be conveniently employed by any pre-trained DNN at no extra training overhead. Selecting which units to sample per hidden layer entails quantifying the amount of DNN output uncertainty from the viewpoint of Bayesian neural networks, where the overall uncertainty is expressed in terms of its layer-wise components - what also promotes scalability. Sampling probabilities are then sought by minimizing uncertainty measures layer-by-layer, leading to a novel convex optimization problem that admits an exact solver with superlinear convergence rate. By simplifying the objective function, low-complexity approximate solvers are also developed. In addition to valuable insights, these approximations link the novel approach with state-of-the-art randomized adversarial detectors. The effectiveness of the novel detectors in the context of competing alternatives is highlighted through extensive tests for various types of adversarial attacks with variable levels of strength."

In the blow-down limit, the obtained wavefunctions of chiral zero-modes result in those on the magnetized $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold models, but the wavefunctions of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-invariant zero-modes receive the blow-up effects around fixed points of $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds.

In many biostatistical applications, labels are manually assigned by experts, who may leave some observations unlabelled due to class uncertainty. We analyse semi-supervised learning as a missing data problem and identify situations where the missing label pattern is non-ignorable for the purposes of maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we find that a relationship between classification difficulty and the missing label pattern implies a non-ignorable missingness mechanism. We examine a number of real datasets and conclude the pattern of missing labels is related to the difficulty of classification. We propose a joint modelling strategy involving the observed data and the missing label mechanism to account for the systematic missing labels. Full likelihood inference including the missing label mechanism can improve the efficiency of parameter estimation, and increase classification accuracy."

However, a key component of the dual-phase detector technology--the efficiency of charge extraction from liquid xenon into gas--has not been well characterized. In this paper, we report a new measurement of the electron extraction efficiency (EEE) in a small xenon detector using two mono-energetic decay features of $^{37}$Ar. By achieving stable operation at very high voltages, we measured the EEE values at the highest extraction electric field strength reported to date. For the first time, an apparent saturation of the EEE is observed over a large range of electric field; between 7.5 kV/cm and 10.4 kV/cm extraction field in the liquid xenon the EEE stays stable at the level of 1%(kV/cm)$^{-1}$. In the context of electron transport models developed for xenon, we discuss how the observed saturation may help calibrate this relative EEE measurement to the absolute EEE values. In addition, we present the implications of this result not only to current and future xenon-based dark matter searches, but also to xenon-based searches for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scatters."

For instance, video editing requires temporal coherence across multiple clips and thus poses both start and end constraints within a video sequence. We introduce point-to-point video generation that controls the generation process with two control points: the targeted start- and end-frames. The task is challenging since the model not only generates a smooth transition of frames, but also plans ahead to ensure that the generated end-frame conforms to the targeted end-frame for videos of various length. We propose to maximize the modified variational lower bound of conditional data likelihood under a skip-frame training strategy. Our model can generate sequences such that their end-frame is consistent with the targeted end-frame without loss of quality and diversity. Extensive experiments are conducted on Stochastic Moving MNIST, Weizmann Human Action, and Human3.6M to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We demonstrate our method under a series of scenarios (e.g., dynamic length generation) and the qualitative results showcase the potential and merits of point-to-point generation.

We have modelled the changes in the optical spin period pulse shape using a cyclotron emission mapping technique. The resulting cyclotron emission maps of the magnetic white dwarf reveal how the accretion geometry changes from single to two pole accretion and back over the beat cycle. Finally, we present the results from particle based numerical magnetic accretion simulations, that agree with our interpretation of the changing accretion scenario."

Detailed electron backscatter diffraction analysis revealed that, in contrast to the predictions of shear-coupled grain boundary migration model, the grain coarsening is isotropic and coarsened grains do not exhibit any specific crystallographic orientations or misorientations to the neighboring grains. It is shown that a thermodynamic model where the driving force appears due to the difference in yield stresses between the grains with different sizes provides an adequate explanation of the experimental data."

Finally, we discuss the collisional evolution of the KBO population, arguing that the current size-frequency distribution below 100~km in size has been achieved as a collisional equilibrium in a few tens of My inside the original massive trans-Neptunain disk, possibly with the exception of the cold population sub-component."

Key determinants for household food insecurity are income and food costs. Whereas short-term household incomes are likely to remain static, increased food prices would be a significant driver of food insecurity. To investigate food price drivers for household food security and its health consequences in the UK under scenarios of Deal and No deal for Brexit . To estimate the 5\% and 95\% quantiles of the projected price distributions. Structured expert judgement elicitation, a well-established method for quantifying uncertainty, using experts. In July 2018, each expert estimated the median, 5\% and 95\% quantiles of changes in price for ten food categories under Brexit Deal and No-deal to June 2020 assuming Brexit had taken place on 29th March 2019. These were aggregated based on the accuracy and informativeness of the experts on calibration questions. Ten specialists in food procurement, retail, agriculture, economics, statistics and household food security. Results: when combined in proportions used to calculate Consumer Prices Index food basket costs, median food price change for Brexit with a Deal is expected to be +6.1\% [90\% credible interval:-3\%, +17\%] and with No deal +22.5\% [+1\%, +52\%]. The number of households experiencing food insecurity and its severity are likely to increase because of expected sizeable increases in median food prices after Brexit. Higher increases are more likely than lower rises and towards the upper limits, these would entail severe impacts. Research showing a low food budget leads to increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services in both the short and longer term is likely to increase due to the effects of food insecurity on the incidence and management of diet-sensitive conditions."

These data can provide a novel way to learn about the nature of dark matter, in particular about the formation of small size dark matter halos. However, the connection between the formation of structures and 21-cm signal requires knowledge of stellar to total mass relation, escape fraction of UV photons, and other parameters that describe star formation and radiation at early times. This baryonic physics depends on the properties of dark matter and in particular in warm-dark-matter (WDM) models, star formation may follow a completely different scenario, as compared to the cold-dark-matter case. We use the recent measurements by the EDGES [J. D. Bowman, A. E. E. Rogers, R. A. Monsalve, T. J. Mozdzen, and N. Mahesh, An absorption profile centred at 78 megahertz in thesky-averaged spectrum,Nature (London) 555, 67 (2018).] to demonstrate that when taking the above considerations into account, the robust WDM bounds are in fact weaker than those given by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest method and other structure formation bounds. In particular, we show that resonantly produced 7 keV sterile neutrino dark matter model is consistent with these data. However, a holistic approach to modelling of the WDM universe holds great potential and may in the future make 21-cm data our main tool to learn about dark matter clustering properties."

Surprisingly, we find that at $B_{||} = 0$ QHSs in our samples are aligned along $\left < 110 \right >$ direction and can be reoriented only perpendicular to $B_{||}$. These findings suggest that high density alone is not a decisive factor for either abnormal native QHS orientation or alignment with respect to $B_{||}$, while quantum confinement of the 2DEG likely plays an important role."

However, the interplay of structural and chemical degrees of freedom introduces enormous complexity, which the current state-of-the-art tools are not yet designed to handle. The availability of large molecular databases generated by quantum mechanics (QM) computations using first principles open new venues for data science to accelerate the discovery of new compounds. In recent years, models that combine QM with machine learning (ML) known as QM/ML models have been successful at delivering the accuracy of QM at the speed of ML. The goals are to develop a framework that will accelerate the extraction of knowledge and to get insights from quantitative process-structure-property-performance relationships hidden in materials data via a better search of the chemical compound space, and to infer new materials with targeted properties. In this study, we show that by integrating well-known signal processing techniques such as discrete Fourier transform in the QM/ML pipeline, the outcomes can be significantly improved in some cases.

In this work, we explore relations between the chaotic dynamics of an observable and the dynamics of information (entropy) contained in this observable, focussing on a disordered metal coupled to a dissipative, e.g. phononic, bath. The chaotic dynamics is characterised by Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$, the rates of growth of out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), quantities of the form $\langle[\hat A(t),\hat B(0)]^{2}\rangle\propto\exp(2\lambda t)$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are the operators of, e.g., the total current of electrons in a metallic quantum dot. We demonstrate that the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ matches the rate of decay of information stored in the observable $\langle \hat A(t)\rangle$ after applying a small perturbation with a small classical uncertainty. This relation suggests a way to measure Lyapunov exponents in experiment. We compute both the Lyapunov exponent and the rate of decay of information microscopically in a disordered metal in the presence of a bosonic bath, which may, in particular, represent interactions in the system. For a sufficiently short range of the correlations in the bath, the exponent has the form $\lambda=\lambda_{0}-1/\tau$, where $\lambda_{0}$ is the (temperature-independent) Lyapunov exponent in the absence of the bath and $1/\tau$ is the inelastic scattering rate. Our results demonstrate also the existence of a transition between chaotic and non-chaotic behaviour at $\lambda_{0}=1/\tau$, which may be triggered, e.g., by changing the temperature of the bath."

We discuss a complementary picture, using the relatively familiar velocity field, instead of the tidal field, whose intuitive connection to the surrounding, possibly faraway matter arrangement is more obscure. In this 'spin from primordial inner motions' (SPIM) concept, implicit in TTT derivations but not previously emphasized, the angular momentum from the gravity-sourced velocity field inside a protohalo largely cancels out, but has some excess from the aspherical outskirts. At first, the net spin scales according to linear theory, a sort of comoving conservation of familiar angular momentum. Then, at collapse, it is conserved in physical coordinates. Small haloes are then typically subject to secondary exchanges of angular momentum. The TTT is useful for analytic estimates. But a literal interpretation of the TTT is inaccurate in detail, without some implicit concepts about smoothing of the velocity and tidal fields. This could lead to misconceptions, for those first learning about how galaxies come to spin. Protohaloes are not perfectly ellipsoidal and do not uniformly torque up, as in a naive interpretation of the TTT; their inner velocity fields retain substantial dispersion. Furthermore, quantitatively, given initial conditions and protohalo boundaries, SPIM is more direct and accurate than the TTT to predict halo spins. We also discuss how SPIM applies to rotating filaments, and the relation between halo mass and spin, in which the total spin of a halo can be thought of as a sum of random contributions."

The goal is to choose a subgraph of $G$ with at most $k$ edges to minimize the $s$-$t$ effective resistance. This problem is an interpolation between the shortest path problem and the minimum cost flow problem and has applications in electrical network design.   We present several algorithmic and hardness results for this problem and its variants. On the hardness side, we show that the problem is NP-hard, and the weighted version is hard to approximate within a factor smaller than two assuming the small-set expansion conjecture. On the algorithmic side, we analyze a convex programming relaxation of the problem and design a constant factor approximation algorithm. The key of the rounding algorithm is a randomized path-rounding procedure based on the optimality conditions and a flow decomposition of the fractional solution. We also use dynamic programming to obtain a fully polynomial time approximation scheme when the input graph is a series-parallel graph, with better approximation ratio than the integrality gap of the convex program for these graphs."

By taper cut-back, we observed that the dissipative landscape i.e., a non-monotonic variation of the average beam power along the MMF leads to modal transitions of self-cleaned beams along the taper length."

Rev. {\bf 71}, 195 (1947)] we obtain analytic expressions for the Jost functions and the residui of the S-matrix of both (i) redundant poles and (ii) the poles corresponding to true bound states. This enables us to demonstrate that the Heisenberg condition is valid in spite of the presence of redundant poles and singular behaviour of the S-matrix for $k\to \infty$. In addition, we analytically determine the overall contribution of redundant poles to the asymptotic completeness relation, provided that the residuum theorem can be applied. The origin of redundant poles and zeros is shown to be related to peculiarities of analytic continuation of a parameter of two linearly independent analytic functions."

Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark."

Such theory and accompanying tools already existed almost 50 years ago in applied psychology. The core ideas of Agile Process Consultation are that a client initiating a change toward more agility often does not know what is wrong and the consultant needs to diagnose the problem jointly with the client. It is also assumed that the agile consultant cannot know the organizational culture of the client's organization, which means that the client needs to be making the decisions based on the suggestions provided by the consultant. Since agile project management is spreading across the enterprise and outside of software development, we need situational approaches instead of prescribing low-level practices."

A consequence describes the distribution of the all-time supremum of Dyson Brownian motion with drift. A finite temperature version relates the point-to-line partition functions of two directed polymers, with an inverse-gamma and a Brownian environment, and generalises Dufresne's identity. Our proof introduces an interacting system of Brownian motions with an invariant measure given by a field of point-to-line log partition functions for the log-gamma polymer."

However, acquiring a large number of training videos with temporal boundary annotations for each text description is extremely time-consuming and often not scalable. In order to cope with this issue, in this work, we introduce the problem of learning from weak labels for the task of text to video moment retrieval. The weak nature of the supervision is because, during training, we only have access to the video-text pairs rather than the temporal extent of the video to which different text descriptions relate. We propose a joint visual-semantic embedding based framework that learns the notion of relevant segments from video using only video-level sentence descriptions. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize latent alignment between video frames and sentence descriptions using Text-Guided Attention (TGA). TGA is then used during the test phase to retrieve relevant moments. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art fully supervised approaches."

Here $\text{Tr}_k[A]$ denotes the $k_{\text{th}}$ elementary symmetric polynomial of the eigenvalues of $A$. This result gives an alternative proof for the concavity of $A\mapsto\text{Tr}_k\big[\exp(H+\log A)\big]^\frac{1}{k}$ that was obtained and used in a recent work to derive expectation estimates and tail bounds on partial spectral sums of random matrices."

NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) maps covering an area of 102 square arcminutes at an angular resolution of ~3.7"" are produced by combining VLA interferometric observations with GBT single dish maps. The combined maps have a spectral resolution of 0.14 km/s and a sensitivity of 4 mJy/beam. We produce integrated intensity maps, peak intensity maps and dispersion maps of NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) and a line-of-sight velocity map of NH3(1,1). These are used to derive the optical depth for the NH3(1,1) main component, the excitation temperature of NH3(1,1), and the rotational temperature, kinetic temperature and column density of NH3 over the mapped area.   We compare these observations with the CARMA J=1-0 observations of N2H+ and H13CO+ and conclude that they all trace the same material in these dense star forming regions. From the NH3(1,1) velocity map, we find that a velocity gradient ridge extends in an arc across the entire southern part of NGC 1333. We propose that a large scale turbulent cell is colliding with the cloud, which could result in the formation of a layer of compressed gas. This region along the velocity gradient ridge is dotted with Class 0/I YSOs, that could have formed from local overdensities in the compressed gas leading to gravitational instabilities. The NH3(1,1) velocity dispersion map also has relatively high values along this region, thereby substantiating the shock layer argument."

Proposed in the early 2010's, the Segment Routing (SR) architecture helps facing these challenging demands and it is being adopted and deployed. The SR architecture is based on the concept of source routing and has interesting scalability properties as it dramatically reduces the amount of state information to be configured in the core nodes to support complex services. The SR architecture has been first implemented with the MPLS dataplane and then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). The IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6) has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to a general network programming approach, making it very suitable for use cases like Service Function Chaining and Network Function Virtualization. In this paper we present a tutorial and a comprehensive survey on the SR technology, analyzing standardization efforts, research activities and implementation results. We start with an introduction on the motivations for Segment Routing and an overview of its evolution and standardization. Then, we provide a tutorial on the Segment Routing technology, with focus on the novel SRv6 solution. We discuss the standardization efforts, providing details on the most important documents and mentioning other ongoing activities. Then, we thoroughly analyze the research activities according to a taxonomy. We have identified 8 main categories during our analysis of the current state of the art: Monitoring, Traffic Engineering, Failure Recovery, Centrally Controlled Architectures, Path Encoding, Network Programming, Performance Evaluation and Miscellaneous.

Similarly, a clear evidence of the photometric variability is also found for an Am star HD 73045 which is likely to be pulsating in nature with a period of about 36-min. We are also found dissimilar behaviour of elemental abundances of various ions for HD 113878 and HD 118660. The basic stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, radius, life time, distance, proper-motion etc.) are determined for each sample stars. The tidal radius and boundaries of habitable zone of each star are also computed to search the extra-terrestrial life.

We argue that existing ICD systems are constrained by the time required to align a given query image with individual reference image coordinates. We utilize an invariant coordinate system (ICS) to replace the time-consuming image alignment with an offline pre-processing procedure. Our key contribution is an extension of the traditional image comparison-based ICD tasks to setups of the image retrieval (IR) task. We replace each component of the 3D ICD system, i.e., (1) image modeling, (2) image alignment, and (3) image differencing, with significantly efficient variants from the bag-of-words (BoW) IR paradigm. Further, we train a deep 3D feature extractor in an unsupervised manner using an unsupervised Siamese network and automatically collected training data. We conducted experiments on a challenging cross-season ICD task using a publicly available dataset and thereby validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

The properties applied to scale mixtures of Gaussian distributions lead to a new mean function of purely statistical origin, unrelated to the classical arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means. We call it the informational mean and show that when the arguments of the mean functions are Hermitian positive definite matrices, not necessarily commuting, the informational mean lies between the arithmetic and harmonic means, playing, in a sense, the role of the geometric mean that cannot be correctly defined in case of non-commuting matrices.\\ Surprisingly the monotonicity and additivity properties of the Fisher information lead to a new generalization of the classical inequality between the arithmetic and harmonic means."

In particular, we aim to address the following question: Given a set of homogeneous agents with periodic clocks sharing the same parameters, what kind of information flow topologies will guarantee that the resulting networked systems can achieve robust global synchronization? To address this question, we rely on the framework of robust hybrid dynamical systems and a class of distributed hybrid resetting algorithms. Using the hybrid-system approach, we provide a partial solution to the question: Specifically, we show that one can achieve robust global synchronization with no purely discrete-time solutions in any networked system whose underlying information flow topology is a rooted acyclic digraph. Such a result is complementary to the existing result [1] in which strongly connected digraphs are considered as the underlying information flow topologies of the networked systems. We have further computed in the paper the convergence time for a networked system to reach global synchronization. In particular, the computation reveals the relationship between convergence time and the structure of the underlying digraph. We illustrate our theoretical findings via numerical simulations towards the end of the paper."

However, due to the popularization of image and video acquisition devices, the growth rate of image and video data is far beyond the improvement of the compression ratio. In particular, it has been widely recognized that there are increasing challenges of pursuing further coding performance improvement within the traditional hybrid coding framework. Deep convolution neural network (CNN) which makes the neural network resurge in recent years and has achieved great success in both artificial intelligent and signal processing fields, also provides a novel and promising solution for image and video compression. In this paper, we provide a systematic, comprehensive and up-to-date review of neural network based image and video compression techniques. The evolution and development of neural network based compression methodologies are introduced for images and video respectively. More specifically, the cutting-edge video coding techniques by leveraging deep learning and HEVC framework are presented and discussed, which promote the state-of-the-art video coding performance substantially. Moreover, the end-to-end image and video coding frameworks based on neural networks are also reviewed, revealing interesting explorations on next generation image and video coding frameworks/standards. The most significant research works on the image and video coding related topics using neural networks are highlighted, and future trends are also envisioned. In particular, the joint compression on semantic and visual information is tentatively explored to formulate high efficiency signal representation structure for both human vision and machine vision, which are the two dominant signal receptor in the age of artificial intelligence."

In this network, Alice acts as a control center to transmit confidential message and artificial noise (AN). The UAV user, moving along a linear flight trajectory, is intended to receive the useful information from Alice. At the same time, it also sends AN signals to further interference Eve's channel. Aiming at maximizing secrecy rate during the UAV flight process, a joint optimization problem is formulated corresponding to power allocation (PA) factors, beamforming vector, AN projection matrices. For simplicity, maximum ratio transmission, null-space projection and the leakage-based method are applied to form the transmit beamforming vector, AN projection matrix at Alice, and AN projection vector at Bob, respectively. Following this, the optimization problem reduces into a bivariate optimization programme with two PA factors. We put forward an alternating iterative algorithm to optimize the two PA factors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy for FD mode achieves a higher SR than the half-duplex (HD) mode, and outperforms the FD mode with fixed PA strategy."

Here we ask: to what extent can the course of morphogenesis be modulated and controlled by an external electric field? We show that above a critical amplitude, an external electric field can halt morphogenesis in Hydra regeneration. Moreover, above this critical amplitude, the electric field can even lead to reversal dynamics: a fully developed Hydra folds back into its incipient spheroid morphology. The potential to renew morphogenesis is re-exposed when the field is reduced back to amplitudes below criticality. These dynamics are accompanied by modulations of the Wnt3 activity, a central component of the head organizer in Hydra. Reversal of morphogenesis is shown to be triggered by enhanced epithelial electrical excitations, accompanied by intensified calcium activity, indicating that electrical processes play an instructive role to a level that can direct developmental trajectories. Reversal of morphogenesis by external fields, calls for extending its framework beyond programmatic, forward-driven, hierarchical processes."

The contributions are threefold: (1) we propose adaptive-NMS, which applies a dynamic suppression threshold to an instance, according to the target density; (2) we design an efficient subnetwork to learn density scores, which can be conveniently embedded into both the single-stage and two-stage detectors; and (3) we achieve state of the art results on the CityPersons and CrowdHuman benchmarks."

The load-balancing objective is to jointly minimize the fraction of lost customer requests due to vehicle unavailability and the fraction of time when vehicles drive empty during load balancing operations. In order to bypass the intractability of a globally optimal solution to this stochastic dynamic optimization problem, we propose a parametric threshold-based control driven by the known relative abundance of vehicles available in and en route to each region. This is still a difficult parametric optimization problem for which one often resorts to trial-and-error methods where multiple sample paths are generated through simulation or from actual data under different parameter settings. In contrast, this paper utilizes concurrent estimation methods to simultaneously construct many sample paths from a single nominal sample path. The performance of the parametric controller for intermediate size systems is compared to that of a simpler single-parameter controller, a state-blind static controller, a policy of no control, and a theoretically-derived lower bound. Simulation results show the value of state information in improving performance."

Our simulations are performed with the very accurate and stable multi-domain spectral code FlatStar and use the MIT Bag model for describing strange quark matter. Our calculations based on a thorough exploration of the solution space show that the maximum mass of strange stars depends on both the degree of differential rotation and a type of solution, similarly to neutron stars described by a polytropic equations of state. The highest increase of the maximum mass (compared to the value for a non-rotating star) is obtained for models with a low degree of differential rotation. This highest mass is over four times larger than that of the equivalent non rotating configuration. Comparing our results with calculations done for realistic models of neutron stars, we conclude that with the help of differential rotation, strange stars can sustain masses much larger than stars made from nuclear matter for low degree of differential rotation which reinforces the hope of demonstrating, or of ruling out, the existence of strange matter through the observation by gravitational waves, by gamma rays or by neutrinos of the massive material object born from the merger of a compact binary system or during some supernova events."

The proposed process is a collective, coherent Raman scattering followed by neutrino-pair emission from an excited state $|e\rangle$ of a long lifetime to a lower energy state $|g\rangle$; $\gamma_0 + | e\rangle \rightarrow \gamma + \sum_{ij} \nu_i \bar{\nu_j} + | g\rangle $ with $ \nu_i \bar{\nu_j}$ consisting of six massive neutrino-pairs. Calculated angular distribution has six $(ij)$ thresholds of massive neutrino-pair emission which show up as steps at different angles in the distribution. Angular locations of thresholds and event rates of the angular distribution make it possible to experimentally determine the smallest neutrino mass to the level of less than 1 meV (accordingly all three masses using neutrino oscillation data) , the mass ordering pattern , normal or inverted, and to distinguish whether neutrinos are of Majorana or Dirac type. Event rates of neutrino-pair emission, when the mechanism of macroscopic coherence amplification works, may become large enough for realistic experiments by carefully selecting certain types of target atoms or ions doped in crystals. The problem to be overcome is macro-coherently amplified quantum electrodynamic background of the process, $\gamma_0 + | e\rangle \rightarrow \gamma +\gamma_2 + \gamma_3+ | g\rangle $, when two extra photons, $\gamma_2\,, \gamma_3$, escape detection.

X-ray Spectral and Long-term Variability Analyses,"We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of 1152 AGNs selected in the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs), in order to identify highly obscured AGNs ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{23}\ \rm cm^{-2}$). By fitting spectra with physical models, 436 (38%) sources with $L_{\rm X} > 10^{42}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$ are confirmed to be highly obscured, including 102 Compton-thick (CT) candidates. We propose a new hardness-ratio measure of the obscuration level which can be used to select highly obscured AGN candidates. The completeness and accuracy of applying this method to our AGNs are 88% and 80%, respectively. The observed logN-logS relation favors cosmic X-ray background models that predict moderate (i.e., between optimistic and pessimistic) CT number counts. 19% (6/31) of our highly obscured AGNs that have optical classifications are labeled as broad-line AGNs, suggesting that, at least for part of the AGN population, the heavy X-ray obscuration is largely a line-of-sight effect, i.e., some high-column-density clouds on various scales (but not necessarily a dust-enshrouded torus) along our sightline may obscure the compact X-ray emitter. After correcting for several observational biases, we obtain the intrinsic NH distribution and its evolution. The CT-to-highly-obscured fraction is roughly 52% and is consistent with no evident redshift evolution. We also perform long-term (~17 years in the observed frame) variability analyses for 31 sources with the largest number of counts available. Among them, 17 sources show flux variabilities: 31% (5/17) are caused by the change of NH, 53% (9/17) are caused by the intrinsic luminosity variability, 6% (1/17) are driven by both effects, and 2 are not classified due to large spectral fitting errors."

Our approach may be described by the following two steps procedure: first the model learns the notion of acoustic units from the labelled data and then the model uses its knowledge to find new acoustic units on the target language. We implement this process with the Bayesian Subspace Hidden Markov Model (SHMM), a model akin to the Subspace Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) where each low dimensional embedding represents an acoustic unit rather than just a HMM's state. The subspace is trained on 3 languages from the GlobalPhone corpus (German, Polish and Spanish) and the AUs are discovered on the TIMIT corpus. Results, measured in equivalent Phone Error Rate, show that this approach significantly outperforms previous HMM based acoustic units discovery systems and compares favorably with the Variational Auto Encoder-HMM."

In this paper, we study the number of stable pairs, that is, the man/woman pairs that appear in some stable matching. We prove that if the preference lists on one side are generated at random using the popularity model of Immorlica and Mahdian, the expected number of stable edges is bounded by $N \ln N + N$, matching the asymptotic value for uniform preference lists. If in addition that popularity model is a geometric distribution, then the number of stable edges is $\mathcal O(N)$ and the incentive to manipulate is limited. If in addition the preference lists on the other side are uniform, then the number of stable edges is asymptotically $N$ up to lower order terms: most participants have a unique stable partner, hence non-manipulability."

While this publication is beneficial for science in general, it often lacks a comprehensive documentation and completeness with respect to the artefacts. This, in turn, prevents the successful reproduction of the analyses. Typical examples are missing scripts, incomplete datasets or specification of used software. Moreover, issues about licences often create legal concerns. This is true for the use of commercial software but also for the publication of research artefacts without proper sharing licence. As a result, the sole publication of research artefacts does not automatically result in reproducible research.   To empirically confirm this, we have been systematically analysing research publications that also published their investigations as Jupyter notebooks. In this paper, we present preliminary results of this analysis for five publications. The results show, that the quality of the published research artefacts must be improved in order to assure reproducibility."

Existing state-of-the-art supervised methods require large amounts of annotated data to achieve good performance and generalization. Collecting labeled data is, however, often expensive. In this paper, we redefine the problem as question-answer extraction, and present SAMIE: Self-Asking Model for Information Ixtraction, a semi-supervised model which dually learns to ask and to answer questions by itself. Briefly, given a sentence $s$ and an answer $a$, the model needs to choose the most appropriate question $\hat q$; meanwhile, for the given sentence $s$ and same question $\hat q$ selected in the previous step, the model will predict an answer $\hat a$. The model can support few-shot learning with very limited supervision. It can also be used to perform clustering analysis when no supervision is provided.

Capture orbits are divided into the pre- and post-maneuver portions. In the pre-maneuver portion, the gravitational capture conditions are discussed by backward numerical integration. In the post-maneuver portion, the smaller alignment index (SALI) is applied to numerically investigate the orbital characters of long-term capture orbits around Charon. The initial conditions corresponding to three types of motion: (i) bounded (regular or chaotic), (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional are classified and studied. Combining results of the pre- and post-maneuver portions, the near-optimal capture method is presented to find optimal capture points by overlay figures, and then the corresponding capture orbits are constructed in the PCRTBP. The different results between the Pluto-Charon system and the Earth-Moon system are compared and analyzed. Our results obtained in this paper, including the optimal capture points and the corresponding capture orbits, could be applied in future space mission design."

Piantadosi gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a valid tiling of any free group. This condition is actually necessary for the existence of a valid tiling for an arbitrary finitely generated group.   We then consider two other conditions: the first, also given by Piantadosi, is a necessary and sufficient condition to decide if a set of Wang tiles gives a strongly periodic tiling of the free group; the second, given by Chazottes et. al., is a necessary condition to decide if a set of Wang tiles gives a tiling of $\mathbb Z^2$.   We show that these last two conditions are equivalent. Joining and generalising approaches from both sides, we prove that they are necessary for having a valid tiling of any finitely generated amenable group, confirming a remark of Jeandel."

Their overabundance pattern shows the signature of s-process nucleosynthesis. Intrinsic, technetium (Tc)-rich S stars are the first objects, on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), to undergo third dredge-up (TDU) events. Gaia exquisite parallaxes now allow to precisely locate these stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Here we report on a population of low-mass, Tc-rich S stars, previously unaccounted for by stellar evolution models. Aims- Our aim is to derive parameters of a sample of low-mass Tc-rich S stars and then, by comparing their location in the HR diagram with stellar evolution tracks, to derive their masses and to compare their measured s-process abundance profiles with recently derived STAREVOL nucleosynthetic predictions for low-mass AGB stars. Methods- The stellar parameters were obtained using a combination of HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia-DR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models and newly-designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Results- We report on 6 Tc-rich S stars lying close to the 1 Msun (initial mass) tracks of AGB stars of the corresponding metallicity and above the predicted onset of TDU, as expected. This provides direct evidence for TDUs occurring in AGB stars with initial masses as low as ~ 1 Msun and at low luminosity, i.e. at the start of the thermally-pulsing AGB. We present AGB models producing TDU in those stars with [Fe/H] in the range -0.25 to -0.5. There is a reasonable agreement between the measured and predicted s-process abundance profiles. For 2 objects however (CD -29 5912 and BD +34 1698), the predicted C/O ratio and s-process enhancements do not match simultaneously the measured ones."

After validating our pipeline using mock datasets, we apply our method to the latest BAO and supernovae observations, and reconstruct $c(z)$ in the redshift range of $z\in[0,1.5]$. We find no evidence of a varying speed of light, although we see some interesting features of $\Delta c(z)$, the fractional difference between $c(z)$ and $c_0$ (the speed of light in SI), \eg, $\Delta c(z)<0$ and $\Delta c(z)>0$ at $0.2\lesssim z\lesssim0.5$ and $0.8\lesssim z\lesssim1.3$, respectively, although the significance of these features is currently far below statistical importance."

By creating polylog copies of our data-structure, we optimally solve any symmetric Approximate Set Similarity Search problem, including approximate versions of Subset Search, Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), Jaccard Similarity Search and Partial Match.   Our algorithm can be seen as a natural generalization of previous work on Set as well as Euclidean Similarity Search, but conceptually it differs by optimally exploiting the information present in the sets as well as their complements, and doing so asymmetrically between queries and stored sets. Doing so we improve upon the best previous work: MinHash [J. Discrete Algorithms 1998], SimHash [STOC 2002], Spherical LSF [SODA 2016, 2017] and Chosen Path [STOC 2017] by as much as a factor $n^{0.14}$ in both time and space; or in the near-constant time regime, in space, by an arbitrarily large polynomial factor.   Turning the geometric concept, based on Boolean supermajority functions, into a practical algorithm requires ideas from branching random walks on $\mathbb Z^2$, for which we give the first non-asymptotic near tight analysis.   Our lower bounds follow from new hypercontractive arguments, which can be seen as characterizing the exact family of similarity search problems for which supermajorities are optimal. The optimality holds for among all hashing based data structures in the random setting, and by reductions, for 1 cell and 2 cell probe data structures. As a side effect, we obtain new hypercontractive bounds on the directed noise operator $T^{p_1 \to p_2}_\rho$."

Our results can be used to demonstrate at a desired significance level that a given Markov Chain state (e.g., a districting) is extremely unusual (rather than just atypical) with respect to the fragility of its characteristics in the chain. We also provide theorems specialized to leverage quantitative improvements when there is a product structure in the underlying probability space, as can occur due to geographical constraints on districtings."

The long mean baseline of 55 years along with a large sample of class II YSOs ($\simeq$15,000) allows us to study approximately 1 million YSO-years. We find 139 objects with $\Delta R\geq1$~mag, most of which are found at amplitudes between 1 and 3 mag. The majority of YSOs in this group show irregular variability or long-lasting fading events, which is best explained as hot spots due to accretion or by variable extinction. There is a tail of YSOs at $\Delta R\geq3$~mag and they seem to represent a different population. Surprisingly many objects in this group show high-amplitude irregular variability over timescales shorter than 10 years, in contrast with the view that high-amplitude objects always have long outbursts. However, we find 6 objects that are consistent with undergoing large, long lasting accretion events, 3 of them previously unknown. This yields an outburst recurrence timescale of 112 kyr, with a 68\% confidence interval [74 to 180] kyr. This represents the first robust determination of the outburst rate in class II YSOs and shows that YSOs in their planet-forming stage do in fact undergo large accretion events, and with timescales of $\simeq$100,000 years. In addition, we find that outbursts in the class II stage are $\simeq$10 times less frequent than during the class I stage."

GVASes can weakly compute all fast growing functions $F_\alpha$ for $\alpha<\omega^\omega$, hence they are computationally more powerful than standard vector addition systems. On the other hand they cannot weakly compute the inverses $F_\alpha^{-1}$ or indeed any sublinear function. The proof relies on a pumping lemma for runs of GVASes that is of independent interest."

However, many real-world point clouds contain a large class im-balance due to the natural class im-balance observed in nature. For example, a 3D scan of an urban environment will consist mostly of road and facade, whereas other objects such as poles will be under-represented. In this paper we address this issue by employing a weighted augmentation to increase classes that contain fewer points. By mitigating the class im-balance present in the data we demonstrate that a standard PointNet++ deep neural network can achieve higher performance at inference on validation data. This was observed as an increase of F1 score of 19% and 25% on two test benchmark datasets; ScanNet and Semantic3D respectively where no class im-balance pre-processing had been performed. Our networks performed better on both highly-represented and under-represented classes, which indicates that the network is learning more robust and meaningful features when the loss function is not overly exposed to only a few classes."

We test our modified algorithm in two different simulated examples and show that our coordinate transformation significantly increases the computation speed."

This paper describes the design and implementation of this method, as well as an application dealing with a recruitment process in the Special Forces of the Portuguese Army. In addition, it proposes interaction protocols to elicit the preference parameters of the method to facilitate the construction of a decision model when the analyst guides the decision maker. CAT-SD has been implemented in DecSpace, a user-friendly on-line platform for supporting decision aiding processes using one or more MCDA methods. The study related to the Portuguese Army Special Forces recruitment presents and demonstrates how these protocols and a tool like DecSpace can facilitate the process of applying the method in real-world scenarios."

However, equations of motion for macroscopic fields in a transparent linear medium can be written using Ampere {E,B}, Chu {E,H}, Lorentz, Minkowski, Peierls, Einstein-Laub, and other formulations of continuum electrodynamics. We present a representation-independent derivation of electromagnetic boundary conditions and Fresnel relations for the propagation of monochromatic radiation through a piecewise-homogeneous, transparent, linear, magneto-dielectric medium. The electromagnetic boundary conditions and the Fresnel relations are derived from energy conservation coupled with the application of Stokes's theorem to the wave equation. Our representation-independent formalism guarantees the general applicability of the Fresnel relations. Specifically, the new derivation is necessary so that a valid derivation of the Fresnel equations exists for alternative, non-Minkowski formulations of the macroscopic Maxwell field equations."

We establish Ricci curvature-dimension bounds for such products in terms of the curvature of the constituent graphs. We also introduce the $\left( R_1,R_2 \right)$-doubly warped products of smooth measure spaces and establish $\mathcal{N}$-Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounds thereof in terms of those of the factors.   These curvature bounds are obtained by exploiting the analytic and algebraic aspects of Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor for weighted manifolds and Ricci curvature-dimension forms in the case of weighted graphs. Under suitable conditions, we show the constancy of warping functions in both settings when the bounds are achieved at the extrema of warping functions.   In our results, we have included structural curvature dimension bounds on weighted graphs for the most general form of Laplacian which is perhaps of independent interest. This is done by generalizing and sharpening Lin and Yau's curvature bounds. These structural curvature bounds along with the above mentioned curvature dimension bounds can be used to estimate curvature bounds of doubly twisted products of weighted networks and curvature of fibered networks and in turn for measuring the robustness of interplay networks."

Specifically, recent focus is on time-domain based architectures such as Wave-U-Net which exploit temporal context by extracting multi-scale features. However, the optimality of the feature extraction process in these architectures has not been well investigated. In this paper, we examine and recommend critical architectural changes that forge an optimal multi-scale feature extraction process. To this end, we replace regular $1-$D convolutions with adaptive dilated convolutions that have innate capability of capturing increased context by using large temporal receptive fields. We also investigate the impact of dense connections on the extraction process that encourage feature reuse and better gradient flow. The dense connections between the downsampling and upsampling paths of a U-Net architecture capture multi-resolution information leading to improved temporal modelling. We evaluate the proposed approaches on the MUSDB test dataset. In addition to providing an improved performance over the state-of-the-art, we also provide insights on the impact of different architectural choices on complex data-driven solutions for source separation."

Governmental incentives and societal movements have attempted to counter these attitudes, yet accurate measurements of public opinions on caste are not yet available for understanding whether progress is being made. Here, we introduce a novel approach to measure public attitudes of caste through an indicator variable: openness to intercaste marriage. Using a massive dataset of over 313K profiles from a major Indian matrimonial site, we precisely quantify public attitudes, along with differences between generations and between Indian residents and diaspora. We show that younger generations are more open to intercaste marriage, yet attitudes are based on a complex function of social status beyond their own caste. In examining the desired qualities in a spouse, we find that individuals open to intercaste marriage are more individualistic in the qualities they desire, rather than favoring family-related qualities, which mirrors larger societal trends away from collectivism. Finally, we show that attitudes in diaspora are significantly less open, suggesting a bi-cultural model of integration. Our research provides the first empirical evidence identifying how various intersections of identity shape attitudes toward intercaste marriage in India and among the Indian diaspora in the US."

Although this heterogeneity presents a challenge for sensor calibration, it is also the main prospect for reliability and robustness of autonomous systems. In this paper, we propose a method for multisensor calibration based on Gaussian processes (GPs) estimated moving object trajectories, resulting with temporal and extrinsic parameters. The appealing properties of the proposed temporal calibration method are: coordinate frame invariance, thus avoiding prior extrinsic calibration, theoretically grounded batch state estimation and interpolation using GPs, computational efficiency with O(n) complexity, leveraging data already available in autonomous robot platforms, and the end result enabling 3D point-to-point extrinsic multisensor calibration. The proposed method is validated both in simulations and real-world experiments. For real-world experiment we evaluated the method on two multisensor systems: an externally triggered stereo camera, thus having temporal ground truth readily available, and a heterogeneous combination of a camera and motion capture system. The results show that the estimated time delays are accurate up to a fraction of the fastest sensor sampling time."

Despite a rich literature in the field, with works improving old approaches and proposing new ones, the mechanism by which complex behavior emerges in these systems is still not well understood. This literature gap hinders the researchers' ability to deal with known problems in swarms intelligence such as premature convergence, and the balance of coordination and diversity among agents. Recent advances in the literature, however, have proposed to study these systems via the network that emerges from the social interactions within the swarm (i.e., the interaction network). In our work, we propose a definition of the interaction network for the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. With our approach, we captured striking idiosyncrasies of the algorithm. We uncovered the different patterns of social interactions that emerge from each type of bee, revealing the importance of the bees variations throughout the iterations of the algorithm. We found that ABC exhibits a dynamic information flow through the use of different bees but lacks continuous coordination between the agents."

In a robotics environment, the old information is useful for human evaluation, or oracles interfacing with the blockchain but it is not useful for the robots that require only current information in order to continue their work. This causes a storage problem in blockchain nodes that have limited storage capacity, such as in the case of nodes attached to robots that are usually built around embedded solutions. This paper presents a time-segmentation solution for devices with limited storage capacity, integrated in a particular robot-directed blockchain called RobotChain. Results are presented regarding the proposed solution that show that the goal of restricting each node's capacity is reached without compromising all the benefits that arise from the use of blockchains in these contexts, and on the contrary, it allows for cheap nodes to use this blockchain, reduces storage costs and allows faster deployment of new nodes."

One of the pressing research challenges is thus to be able to use these subgraphs to understand the network topology of information cascades which ultimately paves the way to theorize about how information spreads over time. In this paper, we make the first attempt at using network motifs to understand whether or not they can be used as generative elements for the diffusion network organization during different phases of the cascade lifecycle. In doing so, we propose a motif percolation-based algorithm that uses network motifs to measure the extent to which they can represent the temporal cascade network organization. We compare two phases of the cascade lifecycle from the perspective of diffusion-- the phase of steep growth and the phase of inhibition prior to its saturation. Our experiments on a set of cascades from the Weibo platform and with 5-node motifs demonstrate that there are only a few specific motif patterns with triads that are able to characterize the spreading process and hence the network organization during the inhibition region better than during the phase of high growth. In contrast, we do not find compelling results for the phase of steep growth."

The latter has a very important role in the study of topological phases at zero temperature. Closely related, the quantum fidelity is an information theoretical quantity which is a measure of distinguishability of quantum states. Moreover, it has been extensively used in the analysis of quantum phase transitions. In this work, we study topological phase transitions in 1D and 2D topological superconductors with long-range hopping and pairing amplitudes, using the fidelity and the quantity $\Delta$ closely related to the Uhlmann connection. The drop in the fidelity and the departure of $\Delta$ from zero signal the topological phase transitions in the models considered. The analysis of the ground state fidelity susceptibility and its associated critical exponents are also applied to the study of the aforementioned topological phase transitions."

Differently from urban art, graffiti tagging is a vandalism act and many local governments are putting great effort to combat it. The graffiti map of a region can be a very useful resource because it may allow one to potentially combat vandalism in locations with high level of graffiti and also to cleanup saturated regions to discourage future acts. There is currently no automatic way of obtaining a graffiti map of a region and it is obtained by manual inspection by the police or by popular participation. In this sense, we describe an ongoing work where we propose an automatic way of obtaining a graffiti map of a neighbourhood. It consists of the systematic collection of street view images followed by the identification of graffiti tags in the collected dataset and finally, in the calculation of the proposed graffiti level of that location. We validate the proposed method by evaluating the geographical distribution of graffiti in a city known to have high concentration of graffiti -- Sao Paulo, Brazil."

In addition to the visual features, recent approaches have benefited from the use of context, e.g., inter-relationships among the activities and objects. However, these approaches require data to be labeled, entirely available beforehand, and not designed to be updated continuously, which make them unsuitable for surveillance applications. In contrast, we propose a continuous-learning framework for context-aware activity recognition from unlabeled video, which has two distinct advantages over existing methods. First, it employs a novel active-learning technique that not only exploits the informativeness of the individual activities but also utilizes their contextual information during query selection; this leads to significant reduction in expensive manual annotation effort. Second, the learned models can be adapted online as more data is available. We formulate a conditional random field model that encodes the context and devise an information-theoretic approach that utilizes entropy and mutual information of the nodes to compute the set of most informative queries, which are labeled by a human. These labels are combined with graphical inference techniques for incremental updates. We provide a theoretical formulation of the active learning framework with an analytic solution. Experiments on six challenging datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance with significantly less manual labeling."

Building on the successful encoder-decoder paradigm, it first encodes the content representation from the given input text; to produce the output, it retrieves exemplar text from the training data as ""soft templates,"" which are then used to construct an exemplar-specific decoder. We evaluate the proposed model on abstractive text summarization and data-to-text generation. Empirical results show that this model achieves strong performance and outperforms comparable baselines."

However, existing data sets are skewed: some habitats, taxa, and locations are under-represented. Here, we map geographic publication density at the sub-national scale of individual 'provinces'. We query the Web of Science catalogues SCI and SSCI for biodiversity-related publications including country and province names (for the period 1993-2016). We combine these data with other provincial-scale factors hypothesised to affect research (i.e. economic development, human presence, infrastructure and remoteness). We show that sites that appear to be understudied, compared with the biodiversity expected from their bioclimatic conditions, are likely to have been inaccessible to researchers for a diversity of reasons amongst which current or recent armed conflicts are notable. Finally, we create a priority list of provinces where geographic publication bias is of most concern, and discuss how our provincial-scale model can assist in adjusting for publication biases in conservation planning."

However, the robustness to its design parameters has not yet been scrutinized: the size ($N$) and sampling ($\varepsilon$) of the model output, the number of conditioning intervals ($n$) or the summary statistic ($\theta$). Here we fill this gap by running a sensitivity analysis of a PAWN-based sensitivity analysis. We compare the results with the design uncertainties of the Sobol' total-order index ($S_{Ti}^*$). Unlike in $S_{Ti}^*$, the design uncertainties in PAWN create non-negligible chances of producing biased results when ranking or screening inputs. The dependence of PAWN upon ($N,n,\varepsilon, \theta$) is difficult to tame, as these parameters interact with one another.

At low contact pressure a cavity forms, the growth rim undergoes a transition from smooth to stepwise dynamic causing fast, wobbling growth at the confined surface. When contact pressure is increased to 10~kPa the wobbling growth stops, the growth rim becomes smooth again and the growth of the confined surface relaxes to a rate below the detection limit of the measurements. A new, complete theoretical description of the process is presented."

We study the problem of variance estimation from a frequentist Bayesian perspective. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $\sigma^2$ is biased and inconsistent. This raises the question whether the posterior is able to correct the MLE in this case. By developing a new proving strategy that uses refined properties of the posterior distribution, we find that the marginal posterior is inconsistent for any i.i.d. prior on the mean parameters. In particular, no assumption on the decay of the prior needs to be imposed. Surprisingly, we also find that consistency can be retained for a hierarchical prior based on Gaussian mixtures. In this case we also establish a limiting shape result and determine the limit distribution. In contrast to the classical Bernstein-von Mises theorem, the limit is non-Gaussian. We show that the Bayesian analysis leads to new statistical estimators outperforming the correctly calibrated MLE in a numerical simulation study."

This makes hyperspectral imaging an important tool for earth sciences, land-cover studies, and military and strategic applications. However, the scarcity of labeled training examples and spatial variability of spectral signature are two of the biggest challenges faced by hyperspectral image classification. In order to address these issues, we aim to develop a framework for material-agnostic information retrieval in hyperspectral images based on Positive-Unlabelled (PU) classification. Given a hyperspectral scene, the user labels some positive samples of a material he/she is looking for and our goal is to retrieve all the remaining instances of the query material in the scene. Additionally, we require the system to work equally well for any material in any scene without the user having to disclose the identity of the query material. This material-agnostic nature of the framework provides it with superior generalization abilities. We explore two alternative approaches to solve the hyperspectral image classification problem within this framework. The first approach is an adaptation of non-negative risk estimation based PU learning for hyperspectral data. The second approach is based on one-versus-all positive-negative classification where the negative class is approximately sampled using a novel spectral-spatial retrieval model. We propose two annotator models - uniform and blob - that represent the labelling patterns of a human annotator. We compare the performances of the proposed algorithms for each annotator model on three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets - Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas."

These models differ strongly from the well-known local stochastic volatility models, in particular the instantaneous volatility-of-volatility of the associated naked SVMs is not modified, once calibrated to market instruments. They can be interpreted as a martingale version of the Schrodinger bridge. The numerical calibration is performed using a dynamic-like version of the Sinkhorn algorithm. We finally highlight a striking relation with Dyson non-colliding Brownian motions."

With the help of camera images, the proposed framework enables a proactive handover, i.e., a handover is triggered before a temporal variation in the received power induced by obstacles even if the variation is extremely rapid such that it cannot be predicted from a time series of received power. Furthermore, direct mapping allows scalability for the number of obstacles. This paper shows that optimal mapping is learned via deep reinforcement learning (RL) by proving that the decision process in our proposed framework is a Markov decision process. While performing deep RL, this paper designs a neural network (NN) architecture for a network controller to successfully learn the use of lower-dimensional observations in state information and higher-dimensional image observations. The evaluations based on experimentally obtained camera images and received powers indicate that the learned handover policy in the proposed framework outperforms the learned policy in a received power-based handover framework."

At each iteration, this method works with a random coordinate subset selected with probability proportional to the determinant of the corresponding principal submatrix of the curvature matrix (volume sampling). When the size of the subset equals one, the method reduces to the well-known randomized coordinate descent which samples coordinates with probabilities proportional to the coordinate Lipschitz constants. We establish the convergence rates both for convex and strongly convex functions. Our theoretical results show that by increasing the size of the subset from one number to another, it is possible to accelerate the method up to the factor which depends on the spectral gap between the corresponding largest eigenvalues of the curvature matrix. Several numerical experiments confirm our theoretical conclusions."

The material is a small band-gap semiconductor and exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state associated with Mn spins. The compound exhibits a signature of a distinct magnetic moment canting event at 150(5)~K with a canting angle of $\approx 0.3^{\circ}$. Although, some features of the magnetic characteristics of this new compound are qualitatively similar to those of the related BaMn$_2$As$_2$, the underlying Mn sublattices of the two materials are quite different. While the Mn square-lattice layers in BaMn$_2$As$_2$ are equally spaced along the $c$-direction with the interlayer distance $d_{\rm L\,Ba} = 6.7341(4)$ Ang., the Mn sublattice forms bilayers in CsMn$_4$As$_3$ with the interlayer distance within a bilayer $d_{\rm L\,Cs} = 3.1661(6)$ Ang. and the distance between the two adjacent bilayers $d_{\rm B} = 7.290(6)$ Ang. This difference in the Mn sublattice is bound to significantly alter the energy balance between the $J_{1}$, $J_{2}$ and $J_{c}$ exchange interactions within the J1-J2-Jc model compared to that in BaMn$_2$As$_2$ and the other related 122 compounds including the well-known iron-arsenide superconductor parent compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$.

Local decodability in index coding improves the error performance when used in wireless broadcast channels, reduces the receiver complexity and improves privacy in index coding. The 'locality' of an index code is the ratio of the number of codeword symbols used by each receiver to the number message symbols demanded by the receiver. Prior work on locality in index coding have considered only single unicast and single-uniprior problems, and the optimal trade-off between broadcast rate and locality is known only for a few cases. In this paper we identify the optimal broadcast rate (including among non-linear codes) for all three receiver unicast problems when the locality is equal to the minimum possible value, i.e., equal to one. The index code that achieves this optimal rate is based on a clique covering technique and is well known. The main contribution of this paper is in providing tight converse results by relating locality to broadcast rate, and showing that this known index coding scheme is optimal when locality is equal to one. Towards this we derive several structural properties of the side information graphs of three receiver unicast problems, and combine them with information theoretic arguments to arrive at a converse."

A critical compactness vs. temperature threshold is predicted above which any increase in the source luminosity, for a fixed size, would then generate positron-electron pairs rather than continue heating the coronal plasma. Current observations seem to confirm that all AGN populate the region below this critical line. These models, however, have never been probed by observations in the high-luminosity regime, where the critical line is expected to reach low temperatures. To fill this observational gap, we selected two luminous ($log(L_{bol})>47.5$ erg/s) quasars, 2MASSJ1614346+470420 ($z=1.86$) and B1422+231 ($z=3.62$), and obtained XMM-Newton and NuSTAR deep observations for them. We performed detailed spectral analysis of their quasi-simultaneous soft and hard X-ray data, in order to constrain the parameters of their coronae. Using a phenomenological cut-off power-law model, with the inclusion of a reflection component, we derived rest-frame values of the high energy cut-off of $E_{cut}=106^{+102}_{-37}$ keV and $E_{cut}=66^{+17}_{-12}$ keV, respectively. Comptonization models consistently give as best-fit parameters electron temperatures of $\sim45$ keV and $\sim28$ keV, respectively, and optically thick coronae ($\tau>1$). These low coronal temperatures fall in the limited region allowed at these luminosities to avoid runaway pair production."

Furthermore, we also test the compatibility of our formulation for a Higgs-type field, proving that the mimetic curvature potential can mimic the dynamics from a Higgs inflationary model. Additionally, we discuss possible scenarios that emerge from the relationship between matter and mimetic curvature and, within certain limits, describe results for the primeval universe dynamics obtained by other authors."

Our approach can be applied to a wide range of deep neural network architectures and machine learning tasks. In classification, this algorithm allows the generation of a don't-know answer to be generated, which can increase the reliability of the classifier.

A large deviation principle (LDP) for the occupancy process is established, as $n\to \infty$, in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space. Model features that present technical challenges include, Markovian dynamics with discontinuous statistics, a diminishing rate property of the transition probability rates, and an infinite-dimensional state space. The difficulty is in the proof of the Laplace lower bound which requires establishing the uniqueness of solutions of certain infinite-dimensional systems of controlled ordinary differential equations. The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of long queues. In particular, denoting by $E_j^n(T)$ the event that there is at least one queue with $j$ or more jobs at some time instant over $[0,T]$, we show that, in the critical case, for large $n$ and $T$, $\mathbb{P}(E^n_j(T)) \approx \exp\left [-\frac{n (j-2)^2}{4T}\right].$"

Nevertheless, it is not widely recognized that both Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity collapse into Mean Variance under some conditions, which implies that a universal solution to the portfolio optimization problem could potentially exist. In fact, the process of sequential computation of optimal component weights that maximize the portfolio's expected return subject to a certain risk budget can be reformulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and hence as a stochastic optimal control, where the system being controlled is a portfolio consisting of multiple investment components, and the control is its component weights. Consequently, the problem could be solved using model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) without knowing specific component dynamics. By examining existing methods of both value-based and policy-based model-free RL for the portfolio optimization problem, we identify some of the key unresolved questions and difficulties facing today's portfolio managers of applying model-free RL to their investment portfolios."

However, the SBBC function of $\phi\phi$ is insensitive to the width. In the high-particle-momentum region, the SBBC function of $\phi\phi$ increases with particle momentum rapidly and can exceed that of $D^0{\bar D}^0$ whether the width is nonzero or not."

An important component of the ACO system is the visual item counting, which recognizes the categories and counts of the items chosen by the customers. However, the training of such a system is challenged by the domain adaptation problem, in which the training data are images from isolated items while the testing images are for collections of items. Existing methods solve this problem with data augmentation using synthesized images, but the image synthesis leads to unreal images that affect the training process. In this paper, we propose a new data priming method to solve the domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we first use pre-augmentation data priming, in which we remove distracting background from the training images using the coarse-to-fine strategy and select images with realistic view angles by the pose pruning method. In the post-augmentation step, we train a data priming network using detection and counting collaborative learning, and select more reliable images from testing data to fine-tune the final visual item tallying network. Experiments on the large scale Retail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, i.e., we achieve 80.51% checkout accuracy compared with 56.68% of the baseline methods.

We construct shearing-periodic conditions at the radial boundaries of a simulation box from the conservation relations of the basic MHD equations, taking into account the explicit radial dependence of physical quantities. We demonstrate quasi-steady mass accretion, which cannot be handled by the standard Cartesian shearing box model, with an ideal MHD simulation in a vertically unstratified cylindrical shearing box up to 200 rotations. In this demonstrative run we set up (i) net vertical magnetic flux, (ii) a locally isothermal equation of state, and (iii) a sub-Keplerian equilibrium rotation, whereas the sound velocity and the initial Alfven velocity have the same radial dependence as that of the Keplerian velocity. Inward mass accretion is induced to balance with the outward angular momentum flux of the MHD turbulence triggered by the magnetorotational instability in a self-consistent manner. We discuss detailed physical properties of the saturated magnetic field, in comparison to the results of a Cartesian shearing box simulation."

The self-propelling motion of such a droplet is driven by the Faraday instability triggered around the droplet at each impact. We studied in this article how such a droplet behaves in an annular cavity where a periodic pattern is placed underneath the liquid-air interface, altering the Faraday instability. We show that, while the annulus ensures a circular motion of the droplet, the periodic pattern affects the global droplet motion. Similarly to electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals, the average droplet speed nearly vanishes when the pattern has a characteristic length close to half the Faraday wavelength. This effect opens ways to design guides, reflectors, lattices and metamaterials for such macroscopic particles."

An analysis of the relationship between student ratings   and teacher beliefs and practices,"The paper is motivated by the analysis of the relationship between ratings and teacher practices and beliefs, which are measured via a set of binary and ordinal items collected by a specific survey with nearly half missing respondents. The analysis, which is based on a two-level random effect model, must face two about the items measuring teacher practices and beliefs: (i) these items level 2 predictors severely affected by missingness; (ii) there is redundancy in the number of items and the number of categories of their measurement scale. tackle the first issue by considering a multiple imputation strategy based on information at both level 1 and level 2. For the second issue, we consider regularization techniques for ordinal predictors, also accounting for the multilevel data structure. The proposed solution combines existing methods in an original way to solve specific problem at hand, but it is generally applicable to settings requiring to select predictors affected by missing values. The results obtained with the final model out that some teacher practices and beliefs are significantly related to ratings about teacher ability to motivate students."

For massive stars, rapid rotation combines with their strong radiation-driven wind. The aim of this paper is to investigate two questions that are prerequisite to the study of the evolution of massive rapidly rotating stars: (i) What is the critical angular velocity of a star when radiative acceleration is significant in its atmosphere? (ii) How do mass and angular momentum loss depend on the rotation rate? To investigate fast rotation, which makes stars oblate, we used the 2D ESTER models and a simplified approach, the $\omega$-model, which gives the latitudinal dependence of the radiative flux in a centrifugally flattened radiative envelope. We find that radiative acceleration only mildly influences the critical angular velocity, at least for stars with masses lower than 40 Msun. We explain this mild reduction of the critical angular velocity compared to the classical Keplerian angular velocity by the combined effects of gravity darkening and a reduced equatorial opacity that is due to the centrifugal acceleration. To answer the second question, we first devised a model of the local surface mass flux, which we calibrated with previously developed 1D models. The discontinuity (the so-called bi-stability jump) included in the $\dot{M}-T_{\rm eff}$ relation of 1D models means that the mass flux of a fast-rotating star is controlled by either a single wind or a two-wind regime. Mass and angular momentum losses are strong around the equator if the star is in the two-wind regime. We also show that the difficulty of selecting massive stars that are viewed pole-on makes detecting the discontinuity in the relation between mass loss and effective temperature also quite challenging."

This paper introduces the Generative Adversarial Query Network (GAQN), a general learning framework for novel view synthesis that combines Generative Query Network (GQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The conventional GQN encodes input views into a latent representation that is used to generate a new view through a recurrent variational decoder. The proposed GAQN builds on this work by adding two novel aspects: First, we extend the current GQN architecture with an adversarial loss function for improving the visual quality and convergence speed. Second, we introduce a feature-matching loss function for stabilizing the training procedure. The experiments demonstrate that GAQN is able to produce high-quality results and faster convergence compared to the conventional approach."

Recent studies found that carbon under the He-shell can be ignited if the mass-accretion rate of CO WD is higher than a critical rate (about 2 * 10^-6 Msun/yr), triggering an inwardly propagating carbon flame. Previous studies usually supposed that the off-centre carbon flame would reach the centre, resulting in the formation of an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD that will collapse into a neutron star. However, the process of off-centre carbon burning is not well studied. This may result in some uncertainties on the final fates of CO WDs. By employing MESA, we simulated the long-term evolution of off-centre carbon burning in He-accreting CO WDs. We found that the inwardly propagating carbon flame transforms the CO WDs into OSi cores directly but not ONe cores owing to the high temperature of the burning front. We suggest that the final fates of the CO WDs may be OSi WDs under the conditions of off-centre carbon burning, or explode as iron-core-collapse SNe if the mass-accretion continues. We also found that the mass-fractions of silicon in the OSi cores are sensitive to the mass-accretion rates."

In contrast to previous all-optical studies of spin waves we employ laser-induced thermal changes of magnetocrystalline anisotropy as an excitation mechanism. A tightly focused 70-fs laser pulse excites packets of magnetostatic surface waves with a $e^{-1}$ propagation length of 3.4 $\mu$m, which is comparable with that of permalloy. As a result, laser-driven magnetostatic spin waves are clearly detectable at distances up to 10 $\mu$m, which promotes epitaxial Galfenol films to the limited family of materials suitable for magnonic devices. A pronounced in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the Galfenol film offers an additional degree of freedom for manipulating the spin waves' parameters. Reorientation of an in-plane external magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes of the sample tunes the frequency, amplitude and propagation length of the excited waves."

LANET is intended to support scenarios requiring dense deployment and high data rates. In Visible Light Communication (VLC), most of the attention has been centered around physical layer with emphasis on point-to-point communication. In this work, we focus on designing a routing protocol specifically to overcome the unique challenges like blockage and deafness that render routes in LANETs highly unstable. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer optimized routing protocol (VL-ROUTE) that interacts closely with the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to maximize the throughput of the network by taking into account the reliability of routes.   To accomplish this in a distributed manner, we carefully formulate a Route Reliability Score (RRS) that can be computed by each node in the network using just the information gathered from its immediate neighbors. Each node computes an RRS for every known sink in the network. RRS of a given node can be considered as an estimate of the probability of reaching a given sink via that node. The RSS value is then integrated to the utility based three-way handshake process used by the MAC protocol (VL-MAC) to mitigate the effects of deafness, blockage, hidden node, and maximize the probability of establishing full-duplex links. All these factors contribute towards maximizing the network throughput. Extensive simulation of VL-ROUTE shows 124% improvement in network throughput over a network that uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) along with shortest path routing. Additionally, VL-ROUTE also showed up to 21% improvement in throughput over the network that uses VL-MAC along with a geographic routing."

The clarification is obtained from Hilbert spaces that characterise data that give existence, uniqueness and stability of the solutions. The data space is the graph normed domain of an unbounded operator that maps final states to the corresponding initial states. It induces a new compatibility condition, depending crucially on the fact that analytic semigroups always are invertible in the class of closed operators. Lax--Milgram operators in vector distribution spaces constitute the main framework. The final value heat conduction problem on a smooth open set is also proved to be well posed, and non-zero Dirichlet data are shown to require an extended compatibility condition obtained by adding an improper Bochner integral."

Here, we focus on how to use action guidance by means of a non-expert demonstrator to avoid catastrophic events in a domain with sparse, delayed, and deceptive rewards: the recently-proposed multi-agent benchmark of Pommerman. This domain is very challenging for reinforcement learning (RL) --- past work has shown that model-free RL algorithms fail to achieve significant learning. In this paper, we shed light into the reasons behind this failure by exemplifying and analyzing the high rate of catastrophic events (i.e., suicides) that happen under random exploration in this domain. While model-free random exploration is typically futile, we propose a new framework where even a non-expert simulated demonstrator, e.g., planning algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search with small number of rollouts, can be integrated to asynchronous distributed deep reinforcement learning methods. Compared to vanilla deep RL algorithms, our proposed methods both learn faster and converge to better policies on a two-player mini version of the Pommerman game."

Effects of Multiple Agents on User Persuasion,"Virtual humans need to be persuasive in order to promote behaviour change in human users. While several studies have focused on understanding the numerous aspects that influence the degree of persuasion, most of them are limited to dyadic interactions. In this paper, we present an evaluation study focused on understanding the effects of multiple agents on user's persuasion. Along with gender and status (authoritative & peer), we also look at type of focus employed by the agent i.e., user-directed where the agent aims to persuade by addressing the user directly and vicarious where the agent aims to persuade the user, who is an observer, indirectly by engaging another agent in the discussion. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 12 conditions and presented with a persuasive message by one or several virtual agents. A questionnaire was used to measure perceived interpersonal attitude, credibility and persuasion. Results indicate that credibility positively affects persuasion. In general, multiple agent setting, irrespective of the focus, was more persuasive than single agent setting. Although, participants favored user-directed setting and reported it to be persuasive and had an increased level of trust in the agents, the actual change in persuasion score reflects that vicarious setting was the most effective in inducing behaviour change. In addition to this, the study also revealed that authoritative agents were the most persuasive."

For this task, traditional linear inversion methods still face challenges such as sub-optimal approximation and initial model selection. Inspired by the remarkable non-linear mapping ability of deep learning approaches, in this paper we propose to build the mapping from apparent resistivity data (input) to resistivity model (output) directly by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the vertically varying characteristic of patterns in the apparent resistivity data may cause ambiguity when using CNNs with the weight sharing and effective receptive field properties. To address the potential issue, we supply an additional tier feature map to CNNs to help it get aware of the relationship between input and output. Based on the prevalent U-Net architecture, we design our network (ERSInvNet) which can be trained end-to-end and reach real-time inference during testing. We further introduce depth weighting function and smooth constraint into loss function to improve inversion accuracy for the deep region and suppress false anomalies. Four groups of experiments are considered to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods. According to the comprehensive qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison, ERSInvNet with tier feature map, smooth constraints and depth weighting function together achieve the best performance."

The lack of translational invariance of the shell model is avoided, in the present work, by introducing a scalar-isoscalar fictitious particle that represents the origin of quark shell interaction; in this way the states of the system are eigenstates of the total momentum of the baryon. Only one-particle excitations are considered. A two-quark core takes the place of the diquark, while the third quark is excited to reproduce the baryonic resonances. For the $N(939)$ and $\Delta(1232)$, that represent the ground states of the spectra, the three quarks are considered identical particles and the wave functions are completely antisymmetric. The model is used to calculate the spectra of the $N$ and $\Delta$ resonances and the nucleon magnetic moments. The results are compared to the present experimental data. Due to the presence of the core and to the one-particle excitations, the structure of the obtained spectra is analogous to that given by the quark-diquark models."

This work studies the reliability of prediction-based decision-making in a task of deciding which action $a$ to take for a target unit after observing its covariates $\tilde{x}$ and predicted outcomes $\hat{p}(\tilde{y} \mid \tilde{x}, a)$. An example case is personalized medicine and the decision of which treatment to give to a patient. A common problem when learning these models from observational data is imbalance, that is, difference in treated/control covariate distributions, which is known to increase the upper bound of the expected ITE estimation error. We propose to assess the decision-making reliability by estimating the ITE model's Type S error rate, which is the probability of the model inferring the sign of the treatment effect wrong. Furthermore, we use the estimated reliability as a criterion for active learning, in order to collect new (possibly expensive) observations, instead of making a forced choice based on unreliable predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this decision-making aware active learning in two decision-making tasks: in simulated data with binary outcomes and in a medical dataset with synthetic and continuous treatment outcomes."

We prove that the scaling limit of the process is the inverse of an $\alpha$-stable subordinator, which indicates an aging phenomenon, expressed in terms of the generalized arcsine law. In analogy with the case of an i.i.d. random environment studied in details in [Enriquez, Sabot, Zindy, Bull. Soc. Math. 2009; Enriquez, Sabot, Tournier, Zindy, Ann. Appl. Probab. 2013], some `traps' are responsible for the slowdown of the random walk. However, the phenomenology is somehow different (and richer) here. In particular, three types of traps may occur, depending on the fine properties of the tails of the conductances: (i) a very large conductance (a well in the potential); (ii) a very small conductance (a wall in the potential); (iii) the combination of a large conductance followed shortly after by a small conductance (a well-and-wall in the potential)."

Often such systems due to their natural repulsion exhibit remarkable hyperuniformity properties, that is, the number of points landing in any given region fluctuates at a much smaller scale compared to that of a set of i.i.d. random points. A well known conjecture from physics appearing in the works of Jancovici, Lebowitz, Manificat, Martin, and Yalcin ('80,'83,'93), states that the variance of the number of points landing in a set should grow like the surface area instead of the volume unlike i.i.d. random points. In a recent beautiful work, Chatterjee (2017) gave the first proof of such a result in dimension three for a Coulomb type system, known as the hierarchical Coulomb gas, inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising ferromagnet. However the case of dimensions greater than three had remained open. In this paper, we establish the correct fluctuation behavior up to logarithmic factors in all dimensions greater than three, for the hierarchical model. Using similar methods, we also prove sharp variance bounds for smooth linear statistics which were unknown in any dimension bigger than two. A key intermediate step is to obtain precise results about the ground states of such models whose behavior can be interpreted as hierarchical analogues of various crystalline conjectures predicted for energy minimizing systems, and could be of independent interest."

In this paper we apply the so-called $\mathcal{I}$-extremization procedure to three-dimensional gauge field theories and their geometric dual, focusing in particular on the seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold $M^{1,1,1}$. We generalize recent studies on relations among toric geometry, variational principles, and black hole entropy to the case of AdS$_2 \times Y_9$, where $Y_9$ is a fibration of toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold $M^{1,1,1}$ over a two-dimensional Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$. The nine-dimensional variational problem is given in terms of an entropy functional. In order to illustrate the computations as explicitly as possible, we consider cases where either only mesonic or baryonic fluxes are turned on. By employing the operator counting method, we calculate the $S^3$ free energy and the topologically twisted index $\mathcal{I}$ at large-$N$. The result for $\mathcal{I}$, it turns out, can be also obtained from the variational principle of the entropy functional with mesonic fluxes. We also study asymptotically AdS${}_4$ black holes which are magnetically charged with respect to the vector field in the Betti multiplet. By extremizing the entropy functional with baryonic flux, we compute the entropy and find that it agrees with the entropy of an explicit solution in a four-dimensional gauged supergravity which is a consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity in AdS${}_4\times M^{1,1,1}$."

We propose a single architecture that does not rely on external detection algorithms but rather is trained end-to-end on single images. We further merge and propagate information in the temporal domain to infer interactions between hand and object trajectories and recognize actions. The complete model takes as input a sequence of frames and outputs per-frame 3D hand and object pose predictions along with the estimates of object and action categories for the entire sequence. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our algorithm even in comparison to the approaches that work on depth data and ground-truth annotations."

To address this issue, several alternative definitions, such as those based on the full counting statistics and the Margenau-Hill distribution, have been proposed recently. These definitions seem ad hoc because justifications for them are still lacking. In the current study, by utilizing the quantum Feynman-Kac formula and the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, we prove that the leading order of work distributions is equal to the classical work distribution. Thus we prove the validity of the quantum-classical correspondence of work distributions for initial states with quantum coherence, and provide some justification for those definitions of work. We use an exactly solvable model of the linearly dragged harmonic oscillator to demonstrate our main results."

The VLT observation was performed on 2016 June 30, about a week after the detection of a large outburst from 1E 1613. At the position of 1E 1613, we found a near-infrared source with K_S = 20.68 +/- 0.12 mag that was not detected (K_S > 21.2 mag) in data collected with the same instruments in 2006, during X-ray quiescence. Its position and behavior are consistent with a counterpart in the literature that was discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope in the following weeks in adjacent near-IR bands. The XMM-Newton pointings were carried out on 2016 August 19 and on 2018 February 14. While the collected spectra are similar in shape between each other and to what is observed in quiescence (a blackbody with kT~0.5 keV plus a second, harder component, either another hotter blackbody with kT ~ 1.2 keV or a power law with photon index ~3), the two pointings caught 1E 1613 at different luminosity throughout its decay pattern: about 4.8E34 erg/s in 2016 and 1.2E34 erg/s in 2018 (0.5-10 keV, for the double-blackbody model and for 3.3 kpc), which is still almost about ten times brighter than the quiescent level. The pulse profile displayed dramatic changes, apparently evolving from the complex multi-peak morphology observed in high-luminosity states to the more sinusoidal form characteristic of latency. The inspection of the X-ray light curves revealed two flares with unusual properties in the 2016 observation: they are long (~1 ks to be compared with 0.1-1 s of typical magnetar bursts) and faint (~1E34 erg/s, with respect to 1E38 erg/s or more in magnetars). Their spectra are comparatively soft and resemble the hotter thermal component of the persistent emission."

Grounding generally requires reference labeled data, a luxury a low-resource language might not have. In this work, we describe an approach for low-resource unsupervised POS tagging that yields fully grounded output and requires no labeled training data. We find the classic method of Brown et al. (1992) clusters well in our use case and employ a decipherment-based approach to grounding. This approach presumes a sequence of cluster IDs is a `ciphertext' and seeks a POS tag-to-cluster ID mapping that will reveal the POS sequence. We show intrinsically that, despite the difficulty of the task, we obtain reasonable performance across a variety of languages. We also show extrinsically that incorporating our POS tagger into a name tagger leads to state-of-the-art tagging performance in Sinhalese and Kinyarwanda, two languages with nearly no labeled POS data available. We further demonstrate our tagger's utility by incorporating it into a true `zero-resource' variant of the Malopa (Ammar et al., 2016) dependency parser model that removes the current reliance on multilingual resources and gold POS tags for new languages. Experiments show that including our tagger makes up much of the accuracy lost when gold POS tags are unavailable."

Here we present a formulation for fitting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) directly to a triangular mesh instead of using points sampled from its surface. Part of this work analyzes a general formulation for evaluating likelihood of geometric objects. This modification enables fitting higher-quality GMMs under a wider range of initialization conditions. Additionally, models obtained from this fitting method are shown to produce an improvement in 3D registration for both meshes and RGB-D frames. This result is general and applicable to arbitrary geometric objects, including representing uncertainty from sensor measurements."

However, the intellectual property rights, and competitive over-heating issue from sharing the same drug pipeline information are drawback of the approach. In current paradigm of drug discovery, despite approval of new chemical entity, the finding of a new ring system for drug discovery have stagnated. In addition, there are still rarely used ring systems from FDA approved drug that can be optimized and used for repurposing purpose. In the present work, these rarely used drug ring system were re-purposed with our bidirectional target and ring screening (TR- dual screening) approach within our defined objectives. The TR-dual screening suggested RARbeta and cyproheptadine as a pair of target and ring system. The selected ring system was virtually grown with predefined criterion, ranking of molecular docking and top score poses made us select test compounds for synthesis and biological proof. Among the tested compounds, 6c proved RARbeta agonist activity. The concept of TR dual optimization can contribute to picking either a compound having acceptable ADMET profile or a target for a selected drug scaffold."

External stress of the appropriate symmetry acts as a conjugate field of the nematic order parameter and can be utilized to detwin nematic domains but also smears an otherwise sharp nematic transition. On the other hand, applying stress in proper symmetry channels allows one to tune the nematic phase transition. Recent experiments analyzed the stress-induced changes of the nematic and magnetic phase transition temperature. Here we show that the observed trends can be understood in terms of spin-induced nematicity. The strain sensitivity is shown to be a fluctuation effect. The strong sensitivity to antisymmetric strain is a consequence of the anisotropic nature of the magnetic excitation spectrum. The formalism presented here can be naturally generalized to determine the strain-sensitivity of vestigial phases related to other magnetic states that have been observed in the iron-based systems, such as e.g.\ the spin-charge density wave and the spin-vortex crystals."

We perform a 3D reconstruction of both the flux rope and shock using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to calculate CME kinematic and morphologic parameters (e.g. velocity, acceleration, radius). The obtained results are fitted with empirical models describing the expansion of the CME radius in the heliosphere and compared with in situ measurements from Wind spacecraft: the CME is found to expand linearly towards Earth. Finally, we relate the event with decreases in the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) Flux, known as Forbush decreases (FD), detected by EPHIN instrument onboard SOHO spacecraft. We use the analytical diffusion-expansion model (ForbMod) to calculate the magnetic field power law index, obtaining a value of approximately 1.6, thus estimating a starting magnetic field of around 0.01 G and an axial magnetic flux of around 5x1E20 Mx at 15.6 Rsun."

All of the magnetic field values measured by the array are collected by a microcontroller, which pre-process and send the data to a PDU (Processing and Display Unit) implemented on a smartphone/tablets or a computer. An interpolation algorithm and display software in the PDU present the field as a high-resolution video; hence, the device works as a magnetic field camera. In the experiments, we employ the camera to map the field distribution of distorted ambient magnetic field induced by a hidden object.

We point out that the echo phenomenology related with the potential structure might be not so simple as expected. In particular, if the near-horizon regime of BH is modelled as a multiple-barriers filter, the late-time GW ringdown waveform will exhibit the mixing of echoes, even the superpositions. As a result, the amplitudes of successive echoes might not drop sequentially."

The direct synthesis presented here allows the control of the silica surface hydrophobicity by uniform introduction of methyl or phenyl groups. As a result, the lysozyme trapping is observed to be 3.2 times more efficient with the phenyl-functionalized material than MCM-41. For heterogeneous catalysis, Copper was immobilized on the new organosilica surface. In this case, the presence of methyl groups significantly enhanced the product yield for the catalyzed synthesis of a triazole derivative. This method opens a new route of synthesis where the material properties can be adjusted and dedicated to a specific application."

With the initial data $u_0\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ the characterization of solutions behavior under the mass-energy threshold is known for the NLS case from the works of Holmer and Roudenko in the radial [15] and Duyckaerts, Holmer and Roudenko in the nonradial setting [10] and further generalizations (see [1,11,13]); for the generalized Hartree case it is developed in [2]. In particular, scattering is proved following the road map developed by Kenig and Merle [16], using the concentration compactness and rigidity approach, which is now standard in the dispersive problems.   In this work we give an alternative proof of scattering for both NLS and gHartree equations in the radial setting in the inter-critical regime, following the approach of Dodson and Murphy [8] for the focusing 3d cubic NLS equation, which relies on the scattering criterion of Tao [26], combined with the radial Sobolev and Morawetz-type estimates. We first generalize it in the NLS case, and then extend it to the nonlocal Hartree-type potential. This method provides a simplified way to prove scattering, which may be useful in other contexts."

In particular, the large uncertainty ($\sim$100%) in the measured rate of the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction is the largest source of uncertainty in any stellar evolution model. With development of new high current energy-recovery linear accelerators (ERLs) and high density gas targets, measurement of the $^{16}$O$(e,e^\prime \alpha)^{12}$C reaction close to threshold using detailed balance opens up a new approach to determine the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction rate with significantly increased precision ($<$20%). We present the formalism to relate photo- and electro-disintegration reactions and consider the design of an optimal experiment to deliver increased precision. Once the new ERLs come online, an experiment to validate the new approach we propose should be carried out. This new approach has broad applicability to radiative capture reactions in astrophysics."

The derivation is based on a stochastic discrete Hamiltonian which approximates a type-II stochastic generating function for the stochastic flow of the Hamiltonian system. The generating function is obtained by introducing an appropriate stochastic action functional and considering a stochastic generalization of the deterministic Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. Our approach presents a general methodology to derive new structure-preserving numerical schemes. The resulting integrators satisfy a discrete version of the stochastic Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, and in the presence of symmetries, they also satisfy a discrete counterpart of Noether's theorem. Furthermore, mean-square and weak Lagrange-d'Alembert Runge-Kutta methods are proposed and tested numerically to demonstrate their superior long-time numerical stability and energy behavior compared to non-geometric methods. The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation is considered as one of the numerical test cases, and a new geometric approach to collisional kinetic plasmas is presented."

Generally, in a system that is composed of many agents characterized by their wealth and risk-aversion factor, two agents are selected sequentially and randomly to exchange wealth, allowing for its redistribution. Here we analyze how the effect of a social protection policy, which favors agents of lower wealth during the exchange, influences stability and some relevant economic indicators of the system. On the other hand, we study how periods of interruption of these policies produce, in the short and long term, changes in the system. In most cases, a steady state is reached, but with varying relaxation times. We conclude that regulations may improve economic mobility and reduce inequality. Moreover, our results indicate that the removal of social protection entails a high cost associated with the hysteresis of the distribution of wealth. Economic inequalities increase during a period without social protection, but also they remain high for an even longer time and, in some extreme cases, inequality may be irreversible, indicating that the withdrawal of social protection yields a high cost associated with the hysteresis of the distribution of wealth."

In particular, the cases of mean curvature-type diffusions both in the Euclidean space and in Lorentz-Minkowski space enter in our framework. After dealing with existence and stability of monotone steady states in a bounded interval of the real line with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we discuss the speed rate of convergence to the asymptotic limit as $t\to+\infty$. Finally, in the particular case of a Burgers flux function, we show that the solutions exhibit the phenomenon of metastability."

The protocol has two varieties where the two photons can be either entangled or non-entangled and requires a one-way quantum channel and a classical channel.

Both non-relativistic (Schr\""odinger) and relativistic (Klein-Gordon and Dirac) kinetic terms are considered. The 4-tensor defining the interactions is constant but otherwise arbitrary, up to the symmetries imposed by the statistics of the field. In this paper, we focus on models of low dimensions: bosons and fermions for d = 0, 1, and relativistic bosons for d = 2. Moreover, we investigate the large N and massless limits along with quenching for fermions in d = 1. These results are established using the loop vertex expansion (LVE) and have applications in different fields, including data sciences, condensed matter and string field theory. In particular, this establishes the Borel summability of the SYK model both at finite and large N."

Inspired by the fact that humans is capable of interpreting sound sources from how objects move visually, we propose a novel system that explicitly captures such motion cues for the task of sound localization and separation. Our system is composed of an end-to-end learnable model called Deep Dense Trajectory (DDT), and a curriculum learning scheme. It exploits the inherent coherence of audio-visual signals from a large quantities of unlabeled videos. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that comparing to previous models that rely on visual appearance cues, our motion based system improves performance in separating musical instrument sounds. Furthermore, it separates sound components from duets of the same category of instruments, a challenging problem that has not been addressed before."

The temporal integration of the underlying PDEs requires a very large number of time steps, even when the terms accounting for the propagation of fast atmospheric waves are treated implicitly. Therefore, the use of parallel-in-time integration schemes to reduce the time-to-solution is of increasing interest, particularly in the numerical weather forecasting field. We present a multi-level parallel-in-time integration method combining the Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) with a spatial discretization based on Spherical Harmonics (SH). The iterative algorithm computes multiple time steps concurrently by interweaving parallel high-order fine corrections and serial corrections performed on a coarsened problem. To do that, we design a methodology relying on the spectral basis of the SH to coarsen and interpolate the problem in space. The methods are evaluated on the shallow-water equations on the sphere using a set of tests commonly used in the atmospheric flow community. We assess the convergence of PFASST-SH upon refinement in time. We also investigate the impact of the coarsening strategy on the accuracy of the scheme, and specifically on its ability to capture the high-frequency modes accumulating in the solution. Finally, we study the computational cost of PFASST-SH to demonstrate that our scheme resolves the main features of the solution multiple times faster than the serial schemes."

For CNNs used for image classification, in addition to the network structure, more and more research is now focusing on the improvement of the loss function, so as to enlarge the inter-class feature differences, and reduce the intra-class feature variations as soon as possible. Besides the traditional Softmax, typical loss functions include L-Softmax, AM-Softmax, ArcFace, and Center loss, etc. Based on the concept of predefined evenly-distributed class centroids (PEDCC) in CSAE network, this paper proposes a PEDCC-based loss function called PEDCC-Loss, which can make the inter-class distance maximal and intra-class distance small enough in hidden feature space. Multiple experiments on image classification and face recognition have proved that our method achieve the best recognition accuracy, and network training is stable and easy to converge.

This paper presents a robust stereo vision system embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The perspective view of the target image is first transformed into the reference view, and this not only improves the disparity accuracy, but also reduces the algorithm's computational complexity. The cost volumes generated from stereo matching are then filtered using a bilateral filter. The latter has been proved to be a feasible solution for the functional minimisation problem in a fully connected Markov random field model. Finally, the disparity maps are transformed by minimising an energy function with respect to the roll angle and disparity projection model. This makes the damaged road areas more distinguishable from the road surface. The proposed system is implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU with CUDA for real-time purposes. It is demonstrated through experiments that the damaged road areas can be easily distinguished from the transformed disparity maps."

To understand the power loss mechanisms of record-efficiency cells, a more rigorous approach is necessary. Here, we have established a new formalism that can accurately predict absolute performance limits of solar cells in conventional thin film form. In particular, we have estimated the maximum efficiencies of 13 well-studied solar cell materials [GaAs, InP, CdTe, a-Si:H, CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, CuInGaSe2, Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, Cu2ZnGeSe4, CH3NH3PbI3, HC(NH2)2PbI3] in a 1-um-thick physical limit. Our calculation shows that over 30% efficiencies can be achieved for absorber layers with sharp absorption edges (GaAs, InP, CdTe, CuInGaSe2, Cu2ZnGeSe4).

Behavioural plasticity and flexibility of temperament are crucial to successful urban-adaptation. Urban free-ranging dogs experience variable human impact, from positive to negative and represent an ideal system to evaluate the effects of human-induced stress on behavioural plasticity. We tested 600 adult dogs from 60 sites across India, categorised as high - HF, low - LF, and intermediate - IF human flux zones, to understand their sociability towards an unfamiliar human. Dogs in the HF and IF zones were bolder and as compared to their shy counterparts in LF zones. The IF zone dogs were the most sociable. This is the first-ever study aimed to understand how the experiences of interactions with humans in its immediate environment might shape the responses of an animal to humans. This is very relevant in the context of human-animal conflict induced by rapid urbanization and habitat loss across the world."

It was first detected in 2013, and later that year, SXP 5.05 underwent a massive optical and X-ray outburst. This outburst dwarfs any other optical event that has been observed for this system during the last 5 years. The large increase in optical brightness of the system implies an increase in the size and density of the Be star's circumstellar disc. The X-ray data show two occultations of the neutron star per orbit and is not consistent with a neutron star passing behind the Be star, and hence the disc is responsible for these occultations. In this paper, we model the outburst of Be/neutron star binary SXP 5.05 as being due to a large increase in mass ejection by the Be star. The neutron star passes directly through the growing disc, and it is shown that the resulting obscuration can qualitatively explain the observed X-ray behaviour of the system. We find the only way to reproduce the timescales of the observed optical behaviour of the system is to increase the mass ejection substantially for a short time (<2 orbits) and to decrease the viscosity during the event. The general behaviour of the observed X-ray and Ha line emission are also reproduced by the model. However, the inferred mass ejection and viscosity needed to produce a sufficiently rapid increase of disc size are both higher than suggested by previous works."

Sample   variance in spatially-resolved X-ray line diagnostics,"X-ray observations of galaxy clusters provide insights on the nature of gaseous turbulent motions, their physical scales and on the fundamental processes they are related to. Spatially-resolved, high-resolution spectral measurements of X-ray emission lines provide diagnostics on the nature of turbulent motions in emitting atmospheres. Since they are acting on scales comparable to the size of the objects, the uncertainty on these physical parameters is limited by the number of observational measurements, through sample variance. We propose a different and complementary approach for the computation of sample variance to repeating numerical simulations (i.e. Monte-Carlo sampling) by introducing new analytical developments for lines diagnosis. We consider the model of a ""turbulent gas cloud"", consisting in isotropic and uniform turbulence described by a universal Kolmogorov power-spectrum with random amplitudes and phases in an optically thin medium. Following a simple prescription for the 4-term correlation of Fourier coefficients, we derive generic expressions for the sample mean and variance of line centroid shift, line broadening and projected velocity structure function. We perform a numerical validation based on Monte-Carlo simulations for two popular models of gas emissivity based on the beta-model. Generic expressions for the sample variance of line centroid shifts and broadening in arbitrary apertures are derived and match the simulations within their range of applicability. Generic expressions for the mean and variance of the structure function are provided and verified against simulations. An application to the Athena/X-IFU and XRISM/Resolve instruments forecasts the potential of sensitive, spatially-resolved spectroscopy to probe the inertial range of turbulent velocity cascades in a Coma-like galaxy cluster."

More specifically, we consider regularization of the network by its Lipschitz constant and emphasize its role. We highlight the fact that this regularization is not only a way to control the magnitude of the weights but has also a coupling effect on the network weights accross the layers. We claim and show evidence on a dataset that this coupling effect brings a tradeoff between robustness and expressiveness of the network. This suggests that Lipschitz regularization should be carefully implemented so as to maintain coupling accross layers."

The asymmetry in the number of spin up and spin down modes is determined by the topology of both space and the gauge field in which the system sits. An analogous phenomenon also occurs in electromagnetism. Writing Maxwell's equations in a Dirac-like form, we identify cases where a material parameter plays the role of energy. At zero energy we thus find electromagnetic modes that are indifferent to local changes in the material parameters, depending only on their asymptotic values at infinity. We give several examples, and show that this theory has implications for non-Hermitian media, where it can be used to construct permittivity profiles that are either reflectionless, or act as coherent perfect absorbers, or lasers."

For more general design matrices, our results highlight the importance of two properties: the transfer principle and the incoherence property. These properties with suitable constants are shown to yield the optimal rates, up to log-factors, of robust estimation with adversarial contamination."

We found that, among the 33492 phonons of a fully relaxed $\theta=1.08^\circ$ twisted bilayer, there are few special, hard and nearly dispersionless modes that resemble global vibrations of the moir\'e supercell, as if it were a single, ultralarge molecule. One of them, doubly degenerate at $\Gamma$ with symmetry $A_1+B_1$, couples very strongly with the valley degrees of freedom, also doubly degenerate, realizing a so-called $\text{E}\otimes\text{e}$ Jahn-Teller (JT) coupling. The JT coupling lifts very efficiently all degeneracies which arise from the valley symmetry, and may lead, for an average atomic displacement as small as $0.5~$mA, to an insulating state at charge neutrality. This insulator possesses a non-trivial topology testified by the odd winding of the Wilson loop. In addition, freezing the same phonon at a zone boundary point brings about insulating states at most integer occupancies of the four ultra-flat electronic bands. Following that line, we further study the properties of the superconducting state that might be stabilized by these modes. Since the JT coupling modulates the hopping between AB and BA stacked regions, pairing occurs in the spin-singlet Cooper channel at the inter-(AB-BA) scale, which may condense a superconducting order parameter in the extended $s$-wave and/or $d\pm id$-wave symmetry."

While it is true that along their careers many scientists probably felt this tension, only few works have tried to quantify it. Here, we address this question by analyzing a large-scale dataset, containing all the papers published by the American Physical Society (APS) in more than $25$ years, which allows for a better understanding of scientists' careers evolution in Physics. We employ the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) present in each paper to map the scientific interests of $181,397$ authors and their evolution along the years. Our results indeed confirm the existence of the `essential tension' with scientists balancing between exploring the boundaries of their area and exploiting previous work. In particular, we found that although the majority of physicists change the topics of their research, they stay within the same broader area thus exploring with caution new scientific endeavors. Furthermore, we quantify the flows of authors moving between different subfields and pinpoint which areas are more likely to attract or donate researchers to the other ones. Overall, our results depict a very distinctive portrait of the evolution of research interests in Physics and can help in designing specific policies for the future."

The protocol realizes the following functionality, with computational security: the verifier chooses one of the observables $Z$, $X$, $Y$, $(X+Y)/\sqrt{2}$, $(X-Y)/\sqrt{2}$; the prover receives a uniformly random eigenstate of the observable chosen by the verifier; the verifier receives a classical description of that state. The prover is unaware of which state he received and moreover, the verifier can check with high confidence whether the preparation was successful. The delegated preparation of single-qubit states is an elementary building block in many quantum cryptographic protocols. We expect our implementation of ""random remote state preparation with verification"", a functionality first defined in (Dunjko and Kashefi 2014), to be useful for removing the need for quantum communication in such protocols while keeping functionality. The main application that we detail is to a protocol for blind and verifiable delegated quantum computation (DQC) that builds on the work of (Fitzsimons and Kashefi 2018), who provided such a protocol with quantum communication. Recently, both blind an verifiable DQC were shown to be possible, under computational assumptions, with a classical polynomial-time client (Mahadev 2017, Mahadev 2018). Compared to the work of Mahadev, our protocol is more modular, applies to the measurement-based model of computation (instead of the Hamiltonian model) and is composable. Our proof of security builds on ideas introduced in (Brakerski et al. 2018)."

They are most revealing at high energies. In this limit we rigorously derive the Cardy formula for the microcanonical entropy together with optimal error estimates for various widths of the averaging energy shell. We identify a new universal contribution to the microcanonical entropy controlled by the central charge and the width of the shell. We derive an upper bound on the spacings between Virasoro primaries. Analogous results are obtained in holographic 2d CFTs. We also study partition functions with a UV cutoff. Control over error estimates allows us to probe operators beyond the unity in the modularity condition. We check our results in the 2d Ising model and the Monster CFT and find perfect agreement."

One promising genome editing protocol, already validated in living organisms, is based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas protein-nucleic acid complexes. When the CRISPR/Cas approach was first demonstrated in 2012, its advantages with respect to previously available techniques, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), immediately got attention and the method has seen a surge of experimental and computational investigations since then. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in target DNA recognition and cleavage are still not completely resolved and need further attention. The large size and complex nature of CRISPR/Cas9 complexes has been a challenge for computational studies, but some seed results exist and are illuminating on the cleavage activity. In this short review, we present recent progress in studying CRISPR/Cas9 systems by molecular dynamics simulations with coarse-grained and atomistic descriptions, including enhanced sampling."

LEACH (and its variants) are considered to be the most common energy efficient routing protocols for WSN. In this paper, we propose an optimized modification of LEACH that makes use of multi-hop communication, dynamic cluster boundaries and energy conservation in routing to maximize lifetime of a network. We propose a multi-level approach to maximize our gains with regards to energy conservation i.e., i) Dynamic programming based intra-cluster optimization technique has been proposed ii) Ant Colony Optimization is used for energy efficient cluster head connection with sink node and iii) Voronoi Tessellation are employed for efficient coverage planning i.e., dynamic formation of cluster boundaries. In order to accommodate a more flexible adhoc network, hybrid (reactive and proactive) event monitoring based on Deep Belief Network has been integrated in distributed nodes to improve the latency of the system. The results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the current state of the art with regards to network lifetime and throughput."

Our analysis has the potential to detect either individual {\nu}+{\gamma} transient sources (durations {\delta}t < 1000~s), if they exhibit sufficient {\gamma}-ray or neutrino multiplicity, or a statistical excess of {\nu}+{\gamma} transients of lower multiplicities. Treating ANTARES track and cascade event types separately, we establish detection thresholds by Monte Carlo scrambling of the neutrino data, and determine our analysis sensitivity by signal injection against scrambled datasets. We find our analysis is sensitive to {\nu}+{\gamma} transient populations responsible for $>$5\% of the observed gamma-coincident neutrinos in the track data at 90\% confidence. Applying our analysis to the unscrambled data reveals no individual {\nu}+{\gamma} events of high significance; two ANTARES track + Fermi {\gamma}-ray events are identified that exceed a once per decade false alarm rate threshold ($p=17\%$). No evidence for subthreshold {\nu}+{\gamma} source populations is found among the track ($p=39\%$) or cascade ($p=60\%$) events. While TXS 0506+056, a blazar and variable (non-transient) Fermi {\gamma}-ray source, has recently been identified as the first source of high-energy neutrinos, the challenges in reconciling observations of the Fermi {\gamma}-ray sky, the IceCube high-energy cosmic neutrinos, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays using only blazars suggest a significant contribution by other source populations. Searches for transient sources of high-energy neutrinos remain interesting, with the potential for neutrino clustering or multimessenger coincidence searches to lead to discovery of the first {\nu}+{\gamma} transients."

Power generation and pricing in smart grids depends on the continuously gathered information from the consumers. However, having access to the data relevant to the electricity consumption of each individual consumer is in conflict with its privacy. One common approach for preserving privacy is to aggregate data of different consumers and to use their smart-meters for calculating the bills. But in this approach, malicious consumers who send erroneous data to take advantage or disrupt smart grid cannot be identified. In this paper, we propose a new statistical-based scheme for data gathering and billing in which the privacy of consumers is preserved, and at the same time, if any consumer with erroneous data can be detected.

Due to the hot-spot plasmon of the bowtie nanoantenna, the local-field intensity in the gap increases significantly, so that the optical response of the GNF is dramatically enhanced. To study this interaction between classical and quantum plasmons, we decompose this multiscale and multiphysics system into two computational regions, a classical and a quantum one. In the quantum region, the quantum plasmons of the GNF are studied using the TDDFT method, whereas the FDTD method is used to investigate the classical plasmons of the bowtie nanoantenna. Our analysis shows that in this hybrid system the quantum plasmon response of a molecular-scale GNF can be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude, when the frequencies of the quantum and classical plasmons are the same. This finding can be particularly useful for applications to molecular sensors and quantum optics."

However, existing methods rarely exploit the time-frequency properties of traffic speed observations, and often neglect the propagation of traffic flows from upstream to downstream road segments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that learns the spatio-temporal dependency in traffic flows and predicts short-term traffic speeds on a road network. Specifically, we employ wavelet transform to decompose raw traffic data into several components with different frequency sub-bands. A Motif-based Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Motif-GCRNN) and Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) are used to train and predict low-frequency components and high-frequency components, respectively. In the Motif-GCRNN framework, we integrate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with local sub-graph structures - Motifs - to capture the spatial correlations among road segments, and apply Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract the short-term and periodic patterns in traffic speeds.

A high volume of redundant data transmitted through the network will result in collisions, data loss, and energy dissipation. This paper proposes a novel data reduction scheme, that exploits the spatial-temporal correlation among sensor data in order to determine the optimal sampling strategy for the deployed sensor nodes. This strategy reduces the overall sampling/transmission rates while preserving the quality of the data. Moreover, a back-end reconstruction algorithm is deployed on the workstation (Sink). This algorithm can reproduce the data that have not been sampled by finding the spatial and temporal correlation among the reported data set, and filling the 'non-sampled' parts with predictions. We have used real sensor data of a network that was deployed at the Grand-St-Bernard pass located between Switzerland and Italy. We tested our approach using the previously mentioned data-set and compared it to a recent adaptive sampling based data reduction approach. The obtained results show that our proposed method consumes up to 60% less energy and can handle non-stationary data more effectively."

Exemplified by BERT, a recently proposed such architecture, we demonstrate that despite being trained on huge amounts of data, deep language models still struggle to understand rare words. To fix this problem, we adapt Attentive Mimicking, a method that was designed to explicitly learn embeddings for rare words, to deep language models. In order to make this possible, we introduce one-token approximation, a procedure that enables us to use Attentive Mimicking even when the underlying language model uses subword-based tokenization, i.e., it does not assign embeddings to all words. To evaluate our method, we create a novel dataset that tests the ability of language models to capture semantic properties of words without any task-specific fine-tuning. Using this dataset, we show that adding our adapted version of Attentive Mimicking to BERT does indeed substantially improve its understanding of rare words."

In addition to the discovery of a nodal plane at $k_{z}=\pi$ protected by the joint operation of time-reversal (${\cal T}$) and the 2-fold screw rotation $S_{2z}$, we found 24 Weyl points mainly residing at the $k_{y}=0$ plane with notable Fermi arc and large quasiparticle interference pattern (QPI). Due to the absence of mirror symmetry, a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality reside at different binding energies, which makes this system an excellent material candidate for realizing the novel chiral anomaly related phenomenon, such as the quantized circular photogalvanic and the chiral magnetic effects. Furthermore, we also reveal the striking spin textures at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane which demonstrates, in a large region of the surface Brillouin Zone, a direction-selective spin polarization, which has a strong implication to spintronic applications."

This symmetry is broken (i) explicitly by renormalization-group (RG) effects and (ii) softly by the bilinear scalar mass term $m^2_{12}$. We find that in the MS-2HDM all quartic couplings can unify at large RG scales $\mu_X \sim 10^{11}\,$-$\,10^{20}$ GeV. In particular, we show that quartic coupling unification can take place in two different conformally invariant points, where all quartic couplings vanish. We perform a vacuum stability analysis of the model in order to ensure that the electro-weak vacuum is sufficiently long-lived. The MS-2HDM is a minimal and very predictive extension of the SM governed by only three additional parameters: the unification scale $\mu_X$, the charged Higgs mass $M_{h^{\pm}}$ (or $m^2_{12}$) and $\tan\beta$, which allow one to determine the entire Higgs sector of the model. In terms of these input parameters, we present illustrative predictions of misalignment for the SM-like Higgs-boson couplings to the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons and, for the first time, to the top and bottom quarks."

They allow us to recover (from a sequence of observed choices) the ranking of preferences of each person, the attention mechanism, and the set of connections or nodes between the people in the network. The identification strategy we offer does not rely on the variation of the set of available options (or menus) which remain the same across all the observations."

But how exactly can we rectify our logical formalisms so that semantics, an endeavor that has occupied the most penetrating minds for over two centuries, can become (nearly) trivial, and what exactly does it mean to assume a theory of the world in our semantics? In this paper we hope to provide answers for both questions. First, we believe that a commonsense theory of the world can (and should) be embedded in our semantic formalisms resulting in a logical semantics grounded in commonsense metaphysics. Moreover, we believe the first step to accomplishing this vision is rectifying what we think was a crucial oversight in logical semantics, namely the failure to distinguish between two fundamentally different types of concepts: (i) ontological concepts, that correspond to what Cocchiarella (2001) calls first-intension concepts and are types in a strongly-typed ontology; and (ii) logical concepts (or second intension concepts), that are predicates corresponding to properties of (and relations between) objects of various ontological types1. In such a framework, which we will refer to henceforth by ontologik, it will be shown how type unification and other type operations can be used to account for the `missing text phenomenon' (MTP) (see Saba, 2019a) that is at the heart of most challenges in the semantics of natural language, by uncovering the significant amount of missing text that is never explicitly stated in everyday discourse, but is often implicitly assumed as shared background knowledge."

Using the Yang-Baxter algebra of the model and a certain rotation operation that acts on our partition functions, we show that they are eigenfunctions of the Cherednik-Dunkl operators $Y_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$, and are thus equal to nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials $E_{\mu}$. Our partition functions have the combinatorial interpretation of ensembles of coloured lattice paths which traverse a cylinder. Applying a simple bijection to such path ensembles, we show how to recover the well-known combinatorial formula for $E_{\mu}$ due to Haglund-Haiman-Loehr."

De-identifying data does not guarantee privacy because multiple datasets can be linked for inferences. A common belief is that aggregating individuals' data into composite representations such as heatmaps protects the individual. However, we analytically examine the privacy of (noise-free) heatmaps and show that they do not guarantee privacy. We further propose two noise mechanisms that guarantee privacy and analyze their privacy-utility tradeoff. Analysis reveals that our Gaussian noise mechanism is an elegant solution to preserve privacy for heatmaps. Our results have implications for interdisciplinary research to create differentially private mechanisms for eye tracking."

Many have attributed the mere exposure effect as the source of influence in purchase intention and purchase decision; however, most of the studies of television advertisement effects are not only outdated, but their sample size is questionable and their environments do not reflect reality. With the advent of the internet, social media and new information technologies, many recent studies focus on the effects of online advertisement, meanwhile, the investment in television advertisement still has not declined. In response to this, we applied machine learning algorithms SVM and XGBoost, as well as Logistic Regression, to construct a number of prediction models based on at-home advertisement exposure time and demographic data, examining the predictability of Actual Purchase and Purchase Intention behaviors of 3000 customers across 36 different products during the span of 3 months. If models based on exposure time had unreliable predictability in contrast to models based on demographic data, doubts would surface about the effectiveness of the hard investment in television advertising. Based on our results, we found that models based on advert exposure time were consistently low in their predictability in comparison with models based on demographic data only, and with models based on both demographic data and exposure time data. We also found that there was not a statistically significant difference between these last two kinds of models. This suggests that advert exposure time has little to no effect in the short-term in increasing positive actual purchase behavior."

We consider a practical scenario where each user requests a content file according to its own preferences, which is motivated by the existence of heterogeneity in file preferences among different users. Under our model, we consider a single-hop-based device-to-device (D2D) content delivery protocol and characterize the average hit ratio for the following two file preference cases: the personalized file preferences and the common file preferences. By assuming that the model parameters such as user activity levels, user file preferences, and file popularity are unknown and thus need to be inferred, we present a collaborative filtering (CF)-based approach to learn these parameters. Then, we reformulate the hit ratio maximization problems into a submodular function maximization and propose two computationally efficient algorithms including a greedy approach to efficiently solve the cache allocation problems. We analyze the computational complexity of each algorithm. Moreover, we analyze the corresponding level of the approximation that our greedy algorithm can achieve compared to the optimal solution. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed framework employing the personalized file preferences brings substantial gains over its counterpart for various system parameters."

The main contribution is a geometric correspondence verification approach for re-ranking a shortlist of retrieved database images based on their dense pair-wise matching with the query image at a pixel level. We determine a set of cyclically consistent dense pixel matches between the pair of images and evaluate local similarity of matched pixels using neural network based image descriptors. Final re-ranking is based on a novel similarity function, which fuses the local similarity metric with a global similarity metric and a geometric consistency measure computed for the matched pixels. For dense matching our approach utilizes a modified version of a recently proposed dense geometric correspondence network (DGC-Net), which we also improve by optimizing the architecture. The proposed model and similarity metric compare favourably to the state-of-the-art image retrieval methods. In addition, we apply our method to the problem of long-term visual localization demonstrating promising results and generalization across datasets."

Instead of relying on hand-crafted selecting and averaging strategies, we propose to explicitly learn this process with deep neural networks. Specifically, we propose deformable 2D kernels for image denoising where the sampling locations and kernel weights are both learned. The proposed kernel naturally adapts to image structures and could effectively reduce the oversmoothing artifacts. Furthermore, we develop 3D deformable kernels for video denoising to more efficiently sample pixels across the spatial-temporal space. Our method is able to solve the misalignment issues of large motion from dynamic scenes. For better training our video denoising model, we introduce the trilinear sampler and a new regularization term. We demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising approaches on both synthetic and real-world data."

BICs are not only of great theoretical interest, but have a wide range of practical applications, e.g. in the design of optical resonators. Here, we study this phenomenon in a new integrated nanophotonic element consisting of a single dielectric ridge terminating an abruptly ended slab waveguide. This structure can be considered as an on-chip analogue of the Gires-Tournois interferometer (GTI). We demonstrate that, in contrast to the conventional GTI, the proposed integrated structure supports high-Q phase resonances and ""conditional"" BICs. We develop a simple but extremely accurate coupled-wave model, which clarifies the physics of the BIC formation and enables predicting their locations. We show that the studied BICs are topologically protected and, for the first time, investigate the strong phase resonance effect, which occurs when two BICs with opposite topological charges annihilate."

However, the grading is subjective and suffers from high intra and inter-user variability. To improve the consistency and objectivity in the grading, we introduced glandular tissue WithOut Basal cells (WOB) as the ground truth. The presence of basal cells is the most accepted biomarker for benign glandular tissue and the absence of basal cells is a strong indicator of acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma, the most common form of prostate cancer. Glandular tissue can objectively be assessed as WOB or not WOB by using specific immunostaining for glandular tissue (Cytokeratin 8/18) and for basal cells (Cytokeratin 5/6 + p63). Even more, WOB allowed us to develop a semi-automated data generation pipeline to speed up the tremendously time consuming and expensive process of annotating whole slide images by pathologists. We generated 295 prostatectomy images exhaustively annotated with WOB. Then we used our Deep Learning Framework, which achieved the $2^{nd}$ best reported score in Camelyon17 Challenge, to train networks for segmenting WOB in needle biopsies. Evaluation of the model on 63 needle biopsies showed promising results which were improved further by finetuning the model on 118 biopsies annotated with WOB, achieving F1-score of 0.80 and Precision-Recall AUC of 0.89 at the pixel-level. Then we compared the performance of the model against 17 biopsies annotated independently by 3 pathologists using only H\&E staining. The comparison demonstrated that the model performed on a par with the pathologists. Finally, the model detected and accurately outlined existing WOB areas in two biopsies incorrectly annotated as totally WOB-free biopsies by three pathologists and in one biopsy by two pathologists."

VHE photons, at energies higher than 300 GeV, were recently reported by the MAGIC collaboration for this burst. Immediately, GRB 190114C was followed up by a massive observational campaign covering a large fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we obtain the LAT light curve of GRB 190114C and show that it exhibits similar features to other bright LAT-detected bursts; the first high-energy photon ($\geq$ 100 MeV) is delayed with the onset of the prompt phase and the flux light curve exhibits a long-lived emission (lasting much longer than the prompt phase) and a short-lasting bright peak (located at the beginning of long-lived emission). Analyzing the multi-wavelength observations, we show that the short-lasting LAT and GBM bright peaks are consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model and the long-lived observations with the standard synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from a stratified stellar-wind like medium to a uniform ISM-like medium. Given the best-fit values, a bright optical flash produced by synchrotron reverse-shock emission is expected. From our analysis we infer that the high-energy photons are produced in the deceleration phase of the outflow and some additional processes to synchrotron in the forward shocks should be considered to properly describe the LAT photons with energies beyond the synchrotron limit. Moreover, we claim that an outflow endowed with magnetic fields could describe the polarization and properties exhibited in the light curve of GRB 190114C."

Here we hypothesize that a deep neural network can predict an important future clinical event (one-year all-cause mortality) from ECG voltage-time traces. We show good performance for predicting one-year mortality with an average AUC of 0.85 from a model cross-validated on 1,775,926 12-lead resting ECGs, that were collected over a 34-year period in a large regional health system. Even within the large subset of ECGs interpreted as 'normal' by a physician (n=297,548), the model performance to predict one-year mortality remained high (AUC=0.84), and Cox Proportional Hazard model revealed a hazard ratio of 6.6 (p<0.005) for the two predicted groups (dead vs alive one year after ECG) over a 30-year follow-up period. A blinded survey of three cardiologists suggested that the patterns captured by the model were generally not visually apparent to cardiologists even after being shown 240 paired examples of labeled true positives (dead) and true negatives (alive). In summary, deep learning can add significant prognostic information to the interpretation of 12-lead resting ECGs, even in cases that are interpreted as 'normal' by physicians."

This technique is based on modulation of transition frequency of the X-ray laser by the same IR field, as used to generate the harmonics, via linear Stark effect, which results in redistribution of the resonant gain and simultaneous amplification of a wide set of harmonics in the incident field. We propose an experimental implementation of the suggested technique in active medium of C5+ ions at wavelength 3.4 nm in the ""water window"" range and show the possibility to amplify by two orders of magnitude a train of attosecond pulses with pulse duration down to 100 as. We show also a possibility to isolate a single attosecond pulse from the incident attosecond pulse train during its amplification in optically deep modulated medium."

However, when exploring a large chemical space the determination of shape needs to be automated. We present a fast and simple approach to identify a molecule as linear, planar, cube, cuboid, disk, elliptical disk, spheroid and sphere which is more fine grained than existing approaches. The method is applied to more than one billion molecules ranging from small organic molecules to whole proteins. The results show that current chemistry research is biased towards planar geometries. Moreover, we demonstrate that our molecular shape classification correlates with sought-after properties like the band gap, dipole moment, and heat capacity. This allows to increase the efficiency of molecular design studies by driving high-throughput-screening efforts towards desired values of molecular properties."

This ubiquitous model is of relevance in a number of physical systems where, in general, one has neither control over the bosonic modes, nor the ability to tune distinct interaction mechanisms. Despite this apparent lack of control, we present a suitable transformation that approximately maps the spin-boson dynamics into that of a tunable multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model undergoing dissipation. Interestingly, the latter model describes the coherent interaction between a spin and a single bosonic mode via the simultaneous exchange of n bosons per spin excitation. Resorting to the so-called reaction coordinate method, we identify a relevant collective bosonic mode in the environment which is then used to generate multiphoton interactions following the proposed theoretical framework. Moreover, we show that spin-boson models featuring structured environments can lead into non-Markovian multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings dynamics. We discuss the validity of the proposed method depending on the parameters and analyze its performance, which is supported by numerical simulations. In this manner, the spin-boson model serves as a good analog quantum simulator for the inspection and realization of multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings models as well as the interplay of non-Markovian effects, and thus, as a simulator of light-matter systems with tunable interaction mechanisms."

The Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}_v$ is chosen to be graph-preserving, and the matrix elements of $\hat{H}_v$ are explicitly worked out in a suitable basis. The non-trivial Euclidean part $\hat{H}_v^E$ of $\hat{H}_v$ is studied in details. It turns out that by choosing a specific symmetrization of $\hat{H}_v^E$, the dynamics driven by the Hamiltonian gives a picture of bouncing evolution. Our result in the model of full loop quantum gravity gives a significant echo of the well-known quantum bounce in the symmetry-reduced model of loop quantum cosmology, which indicates a closed relation between singularity resolution and quantum geometry."

It has been revealed that anharmonic approximation is useful when analyzing the static and dynamic components of the atomic displacement parameters of gadolinium. The barrier height of double-well potential of Gd3+ ions was determined both from low-temperature heat capacity measurements and from the electron density distribution reconstructed from X-ray data.

Since the $nc$ t-matrix corresponds to an energy-dependent potential, we consider the consequent modifications to the standard normalization and orthogonality conditions.

In this regime, the ${}^6$He probability density is regulator independent, provided the cutoff is significantly above the EFT breakdown scale."

It is assumed that the object is made of pseudo-Goldstone bosons subjected to a scalar potential that leads to a repulsive self-interaction force, and which is characterized by two unknown mass scales $m$ (mass of the particle) and $F$ (decay constant). First we integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the star, and then we solve the Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem for the perturbations using the shooting method. The effective potential that enters into the Schr{\""o}dinger-like equation as well as several associated eigenfunctions are shown as well. Moreover, we found that the large frequency separation, i.e. the difference between consecutive modes, is proportional to the square root of the mass of the star and the cube of the mass scale defined by $\Lambda \equiv \sqrt{m F}$."

It is likely secondary, i.e. produced by colliding solids. Here, we report ALMA Band 8 observations of neutral carbon in the CO-rich debris disk around the 15--30 Myr old A-type star HD 32297. We find that C$^0$ is located in a ring at $\sim$110 au with a FWHM of $\sim$80 au, and has a mass of $(3.5\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$. Naively, such a surprisingly small mass can be accumulated from CO photo-dissociation in a time as short as $\sim$10$^4$ yr. We develop a simple model for gas production and destruction in this system, properly accounting for CO self-shielding and shielding by neutral carbon, and introducing a removal mechanism for carbon gas. We find that the most likely scenario to explain both C$^0$ and CO observations, is one where the carbon gas is rapidly removed on a timescale of order a thousand years and the system maintains a very high CO production rate of $\sim$15 M$_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$, much higher than the rate of dust grind-down. We propose a possible scenario to meet these peculiar conditions: the capture of carbon onto dust grains, followed by rapid CO re-formation and re-release. In steady state, CO would continuously be recycled, producing a CO-rich gas ring that shows no appreciable spreading over time. This picture might be extended to explain other gas-rich debris disks."

These expansions are to be understood as asymptotic expansions, which encode the limiting behaviour of the path integral for positive small coupling. Conventionally, the method of Borel summation assigns a finite answer to the divergent expansion. Still, the Borel sum might not encode the full information of a function, because it misses exponentially small corrections. In the present work, we consider a slight variation of the conventional Borel summation, in which a generalised Borel transform (an inverse Laplace transform) is followed by a directional Laplace transform. These new tools will allow us to give perhaps better answers to typical problems in Borel summation: missing exponential corrections and ambiguities in the Borel summation. In addition, we will define resurgence as a connection between the discontinuity of a function and the coefficients of its asymptotic expansion. From this definition, we will be able to reduce resurgence to the problem of missing exponential corrections in asymptotic expansions and understand, within a unified framework, different approaches to resurgence found in the literature."

This is an extension of the studies for isotropic pyrochlores in Phys. Rev. B 96, 125145 (2017) to the anisotropic case, as the lattice inversion symmetry is broken in breathing pyrochlores. The emergent photons are found to exhibit birefringence, analogous to the isotropic case. However, the system possesses a nonzero polarization even in the absence of an external electric field, unlike the isotropic pyrochlore. We also find that a sufficiently strong electric field triggers a quantum phase transition into new U(1) quantum spin liquid phases which trap $\pi$-fluxes of the emergent electric field. Such transitions are seen to occur even when the applied electric field is along a direction that does not show a phase transition in the isotropic limit."

Despite enormous success at exposing countless security vulnerabilities in many popular software projects, applications of testing-based approaches have mainly targeted checking traditional safety properties like memory safety. While unquestionably important, this class of properties does not precisely characterize other important security aspects such as information leakage, e.g., through side channels. In this work we extend testing-based software analysis methodologies to two-safety properties, which enables the precise discovery of information leaks in complex software. In particular, we present the ct-fuzz tool, which lends coverage-guided greybox fuzzers the ability to detect two-safety property violations. Our approach is capable of exposing violations to any two-safety property expressed as equality between two program traces. Empirically, we demonstrate that ct-fuzz swiftly reveals timing leaks in popular cryptographic implementations."

Previous work has overcome these issues by using convolutional networks to learn long-range temporal correlations across high-resolution waveforms. These models, however, are limited by memory-intensive dilated convolution and aliasing artifacts from upsampling. We introduce an end-to-end fully-recurrent hourglass-shaped neural network architecture with residual connections for waveform-based single-channel speech enhancement. Our model can efficiently capture long-range temporal dependencies by reducing the features resolution without information loss. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in six evaluation metrics."

It offers significant benefits in terms of both performance and computational complexity. Current work on multi-task learning networks focus on processing a single input image and there is no known implementation of multi-task learning handling a sequence of images. In this work, we propose a multi-stream multi-task network to take advantage of using feature representations from preceding frames in a video sequence for joint learning of segmentation, depth, and motion. The weights of the current and previous encoder are shared so that features computed in the previous frame can be leveraged without additional computation. In addition, we propose to use the geometric mean of task losses as a better alternative to the weighted average of task losses. The proposed loss function facilitates better handling of the difference in convergence rates of different tasks. Experimental results on KITTI, Cityscapes and SYNTHIA datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform various existing multi-task learning solutions."

However, the origin of color distribution remains debatable. Here, we demonstrate reddish coloration that is stable only at cryogenic temperatures in a laboratory experiment. The reddish coloration was produced on methanol- and water-containing ice irradiated with nitrogen-containing cryoplasma at 85 K. The reddish color visually faded and disappeared at 120-150 K as the ice was heated, unlike well-known refractory organic tholins that are stable even when heated to room temperature. This temperature dependence of reddish coloration under cryogenic conditions could provide a new possible explanation for the absence of ultra-red coloration closer to the Sun in the outer solar system. Our result implies that a reddish material specific to cryogenic environments is useful for the investigation of color diversity and formation mechanism of the outer solar system."

This exactly solvable model involves a highly entangled state resulting from bond-dependent Ising interactions that produce excitations which are non-local in terms of spin flips. A key challenge in real materials is identifying the relative size of the non-Kitaev terms and their role in the emergence or suppression of fractional excitations. Here, we identify the energy and temperature boundaries of non-Kitaev interactions by direct comparison of the Raman susceptibility of RuCl3 with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results for the Kitaev QSLs. Moreover, we further confirm the fractional nature of the magnetic excitations, which is given by creating a pair of fermionic quasiparticles. Interestingly, this fermionic response remains valid in the non-Kitaev range. Our results and focus on the use of the Raman susceptibility provide a stringent new test for future theoretical and experimental studies of QSLs."

The Most Energetic Outflows in the Universe and Other Discoveries,"The Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) has opened a new discovery space for studying quasar absorption outflows and their contribution to AGN feedback. Specifically, COS provides high-quality far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra covering the diagnostic-rich 500-1050 Angstrom rest frame (hereafter, EUV500) of medium redshift objects. The quality and quantity of EUV500 diagnostic troughs allow us to probe the very high-ionization phase, which carries 90% or more of the outflowing material, as well as to determine the distance of most outflows from the central source ($R$). The first objective is impossible to achieve with ground-based spectra, and $R$ can be measured in only $\sim$1% of them. Here, we summarize the main results of the first dedicated survey of such outflows, including the following:   1) Measurements of the three most energetic outflows to date, which can be the main agents for AGN feedback processes in the environments of the host galaxies.   2) All the outflows have a very high-ionization component, similar to the one found in warm absorbers, which carries most of the outflow's kinetic luminosity. This finding suggests that all the high-ionization outflows observed from the ground also have a similar undetected very high-ionization component.   3) Of the 13 studied EUV500 outflows, 9 have $100<R<2000$ parsecs, 2 have $5<R<20$ parsecs, 1 has $0.05<R<50$ parsecs, and in 1 case, $R$ cannot be determined.   4) One of the outflows has the largest velocity shift (1550 km s$^{-1}$) and acceleration (1.5 cm s$^{-2}$) measured to date. This outflow is physically similar to the fast X-ray outflow detected in quasar PG 1211+143."

Nuclear burning of lighter elements that diffuse to deeper layers of the envelope can alter the relation between surface and interior temperatures and can change the chemical composition over time. We calculate new temperature relations and consider two effects of diffusive nuclear burning (DNB) for H-C envelopes. First, we consider the effect of a changing envelope composition and find that hydrogen is consumed on short timescales and our temperature evolution simulations correspond to those of a hydrogen-poor envelope within ~100 days. The transition from a hydrogen-rich to a hydrogen-poor envelope is potentially observable in accreting NS systems as an additional initial decline in surface temperature at early times after the outburst. Second, we find that DNB can produce a non-negligible heat flux, such that the total luminosity can be dominated by DNB in the envelope rather than heat from the deep interior. However, without continual accretion, heating by DNB in H-C envelopes is only relevant for <1-80 days after the end of an accretion outburst, as the amount of light elements is rapidly depleted. Comparison to crust cooling data shows that DNB does not remove the need for an additional shallow heating source. We conclude that solving the time-dependent equations of the burning region in the envelope self-consistently in thermal evolution models instead of using static temperature relations would be valuable in future cooling studies."

Thanks to the thermodynamic information, multiple superconducting phases have been revealed under pressure and magnetic field. The (H,T) phase diagram of superconductivity under pressure displays an abrupt increase of the upper critical field (Hc2) at low temperature and in the high field region, and a strong convex curvature of Hc2 at high temperature. This behavior of Hc2 and the multiple superconducting phases require a state for the superconducting order parameter more complex than a spin-triplet equal spin pairing. Above the superconducting critical pressure, Pc, we find strong indications that the possible magnetic order is closer to antiferromagnetism than to ferromagnetism."

This promising topic has attracted fast-increasing attention recently. Existing works are limited to either merely predicting the node attributes of graphs with fixed topology or predicting only the graph topology without considering node attributes, but cannot simultaneously predict both of them, due to substantial challenges: 1) difficulty in characterizing the interactive, iterative, and asynchronous translation process of both nodes and edges and 2) difficulty in discovering and maintaining the inherent consistency between the node and edge in predicted graphs. These challenges prevent a generic, end-to-end framework for joint node and edge attributes prediction, which is a need for real-world applications such as malware confinement in IoT networks and structural-to-functional network translation. These real-world applications highly depend on hand-crafting and ad-hoc heuristic models, but cannot sufficiently utilize massive historical data. In this paper, we termed this generic problem ""multi-attributed graph translation"" and developed a novel framework integrating both node and edge translations seamlessly. The novel edge translation path is generic, which is proven to be a generalization of the existing topology translation models. Then, a spectral graph regularization based on our non-parametric graph Laplacian is proposed in order to learn and maintain the consistency of the predicted nodes and edges. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world application data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The diffraction properties are well understood, however, the ability to easily model the diffracted beams hinders assessment of the focal, phase and energy dispersive properties needed for many applications. This work begins to collect the elements needed to ray trace diffracted beams within bent Laue crystals for the purpose of incorporation into other powerful ray tracing applications such as SHADOW. Specifically, we address the condition in a bent Laue crystal where a cylindrically bent Laue crystal will focus all the polychromatic diffracted beams at a single location when a specific asymmetry angle condition is met for a target x-ray energy - the so-called ""magic condition"". The focal size of the beam can be minimized, but this condition also results in excellent energy-dispersive properties.

A method is therefore proposed for the extracting patterns of coordinated network attacks on electric power CPS based on temporal-topological correlation. First, the attack events are aggregated according to the alarm log of the cyber space, and a temporal-causal Bayesian network-based cyber attack recognition algorithm is proposed to parse out the cyber attack sequences of the same attacker. Then, according to the characteristic curves of different attack measurement data in physical space, a combination of physical attack event criteria algorithm is designed to distinguish the types of physical attack events. Finally, physical attack events and cyber attack sequences are matched via temporal-topological correlation, frequent patterns of attack sequences are extracted, and hidden multi-step attack patterns are found from scattered grid measurement data and information from alarm logs. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by the testbed at Mississippi State University."

Here, we demonstrate the effect of a crystalline LaFeO3 buffer layer on amorphous and crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. The LaFeO3 buffer layer acts as an energetically favored electron acceptor in both LaAlO3/SrTiO3 systems, resulting in modulation of interfacial carrier density and hence metal-to-insulator transition. For amorphous and crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, the metal-to-insulator transition is found when the LaFeO3 layer thickness crosses 3 and 6 unit cells, respectively. Such different critical LaFeO3 thicknesses are explained in terms of distinct characteristic lengths of the redox-reaction-mediated and polar-catastrophe-dominated charge transfer, controlled by the interfacial atomic contact and Thomas-Fermi screening effect, respectively. Our results not only shed light on the complex interlayer charge transfer across oxide heterostructures but also provides a new route to precisely tailor the charge-transfer process at a functional interface."

Previously, only two such systems have been found. Here, we report the discovery of a third system using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The host star, TOI-1130, is an 11th magnitude K-dwarf in the Gaia G band. It has two transiting planets: a Neptune-sized planet ($3.65\pm 0.10$ $R_E$) with a 4.1-day period, and a hot Jupiter ($1.50^{+0.27}_{-0.22}$ $R_J$) with an 8.4-day period. Precise radial-velocity observations show that the mass of the hot Jupiter is $0.974^{+0.043}_{-0.044}$ $M_J$. For the inner Neptune, the data provide only an upper limit on the mass of 0.17 $M_J$ (3$\sigma$). Nevertheless, we are confident the inner planet is real, based on follow-up ground-based photometry and adaptive optics imaging that rule out other plausible sources of the TESS transit signal. The unusual planetary architecture of and the brightness of the host star make TOI-1130 a good test case for planet formation theories, and an attractive target for future spectroscopic observations."

Observations of either stationary or drifting Type II bursts are common, but a transition between the two states has not yet been reported. Here, we present a Type II burst which shows a clear, continuous transition from a stationary to a drifting state, the first observation of its kind. Moreover, band splitting is observed in the stationary parts of the burst, as well as intriguing negative and positive frequency-drift fine structures within the stationary emissions. The relation of the radio emissions to an observed jet and a narrow CME was investigated across multiple wavelengths, and the mechanisms leading to the transitioning Type II burst were determined. We find that a jet eruption generates a streamer-puff CME and that the interplay between the CME-driven shock and the streamer is likely to be responsible for the observed radio emissions."

We detected a marginally possible quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of ~450 days. Assuming it originates from the helical motion jet in a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) system undergoing major merger, we estimate the primary black hole mass M~7.7*10^{9} M_sun. To explore the origin of the gamma-ray, we investigated the optical-gamma-ray correlations using discrete correlation function (DCF) method, and found that the correlation between the two bands is very significant.

The crystal structure and non-collinear magnetic structure together with magnetic and spin-orbit interactions define the symmetry of the Skyrmion structure. We outline the importance of these parameters in the Heusler compound Mn1.4PtSn which hosts antiskyrmions, a vortex-like spin texture related to skyrmions.1 We overcome the challenge of growing large micro-twin-free single crystals of Mn1.4PtSn which has proved to be the bottleneck for realizing bulk skyrmionic/antiskyrmionic states in a compound. The use of 5d-transition metal, platinum, together with manganese as constituents in the Heusler compound such as Mn1.4PtSn is a precondition for the non-collinear magnetic structure. Due to the tetragonal inverse Heusler structure, Mn1.4PtSn exhibits large magneto-crystalline anisotropy and D2d symmetry, which are necessary for antiskyrmions. The superstructure in Mn1.4PtSn is induced by Mn-vacancies which enables a ferromagnetic exchange interaction to occur.

Such a large value, being the highest among the Yb-based systems, is explained in the light of our ab initio calculations, which show that the 4f electronic states of Yb have a dual nature -- i.e., due to their strong hybridization with the 3d states of Co, 4f states expose both localized and itinerant properties."

In this paper, we propose a wireless powered spatial crowdsourcing framework which consists of two mutually dependent phases: task allocation phase and data crowdsourcing phase. In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg game based mechanism for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to efficiently allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform under the condition that the workers' locations follow a known geographical distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism to maximize the spatial crowdsourcing platform's utility. Extensive experimental results based on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework in allocating tasks and charging power to workers while avoiding the dishonest worker's manipulation."

We investigate solutions to these equations subject to random initial conditions given by harmonizable $\varphi$-sub-Gaussian processes. The main results are the bounds for the distributions of the suprema for solutions. We present the examples of processes for which the assumptions of the general result are verified and bounds are written in the explicit form. The main result is also specified for the case of Gaussian initial condition.

The binary condensate is prepared in the ground state and confined in a pure optical trap. We exploit Feshbach resonances for tuning the value of $a_{12}$. After compensating the gravitational sag between the two species with a magnetic field gradient, we drive the mixture into the attractive regime. We let the system to evolve both in free space and in an optical waveguide. In both geometries, for strong attractive interactions, we observe the formation of self-bound states, recognizable as quantum droplets. Our findings prove that robust, long-lived droplet states can be realized in attractive two-species mixtures, despite the two atomic components may experience different potentials."

The start of the reconnection corresponds to the beginning of the flare impulsive phase. In this paper we study processes before this phase. During the filament rise we recognize an unusual radio continuum with a starting boundary drifting toward lower frequencies. The estimated velocity of the agent generating this continuum boundary is about 400 km/s, similar to that of the rising filament. In association with this filament rise, transient X-ray sources and extreme ultaviolet (EUV) brightenings are found near the filament footpoint and outside the locations where later two parallel flare ribbons appear. Moreover, oscillations with a ~30 s period are found simultaneously in radio, EUV, and X-ray observations. Around the end of these oscillations the flare impulsive phase starts as seen in observations of the drifting pulsation structure and X-ray source located at the upper part of the rising filament. We interpret the unusual radio continuum and transient X-ray sources, which are located outside the two parallel flare ribbons, as those generated during an interaction of the rising filament with the above-lying magnetic loops. The EUV brightening at the filament footpoint could be a signature of the magnetic reconnection inside the magnetic rope carrying the filament. Possible scenarios of the ~30 s period oscillations in radio, X-ray, and EUV are discussed."

However, these discussions might demote the contribution of software engineers who are introverts, possibly leading to sub-optimal solutions and creating work environments that benefit extroverts. Objective: We aim to evaluate whether providing software engineers with time to work individually and reason about a collective problem is a setting that makes introverts more comfortable to interact and contribute more, ultimately leading to better solutions. Method: We plan to conduct a between-subjects study, with teams in a control group that design a software architecture in a team discussion meeting and teams in a treatment group in which subjects work individually before engaging in a meeting. We will assess and compare the amount of contribution of introverts, their subjective experiences, and the designed solutions. Limitations: As extroverts will be present in both groups, we will not be able to conclude that better solutions are solely due to the increased participation of introverts. The analyses of their subjective experience and amount of contributions might provide evidence to suggest the reasons for observed differences."

After observing inconsistencies in the way communication tools (i.e., email, Skype, and Slack) were used, we first reinforced the use of Slack as the central hub for internal communication, while setting clear rules regarding tools usage. As a second main change, we refactored the Jira Scrum board into two separate boards, a detailed one for developers and a high-level one for managers, while also introducing automation rules and the integration with Slack. The first change revealed that the teams of developers used and appreciated Slack differently with the QA team being the most favorable and that the use of channels is hindered by automatic notifications from development tools (e.g., Jenkins). The findings from the second change show that 85\% of the interviewees reported perceived improvements in their workflow. Despite the limitations due to the single nature of the reported case, we highlight the importance for companies to reflect on how to properly set up their agile work environment to improve communication and facilitate collaboration."

We here show that in a quantum dot set close to a p-doped reservoir, this absorption can produce a dark duo, i.e., an electron-hole pair that does not emit light. This unexpected effect relies on the fact that the wave function for a hole leaks out of a finite-barrier dot less than for electron. This difference can render the positively charged trio unstable in the dot by tuning the applied bias voltage in a field-effect device. The unstable trio that would result from photon absorption in a positively charged dot, has to eject one of its two holes. The remaining duo can be made dark with a probability close to 100% after a few pumping cycles with linearly polarized photons, in this way engineering long-lived initial states for quantum information processing."

The nanocomposite of 60% Bi:40% RGO is a beneficial anode material, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 413 and 372 mAh per g at the specific current of 39 mA per g in the 1st and 50th cycles, respectively. In addition, it shows high-rate capability with the discharge capacities of 381, 372, 354, 295, and 238 mAh per g at the specific currents of 53, 100, 200, 500, and 700 mA per g, respectively. The better electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite is due to improvement in the electronic conductivity and significant reduction of volume changes during electrochemical cycling. This study demonstrates the bismuth (Bi) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite as a promising high-capacity anode for magnesium-ion batteries with longer life cycle and high-rate performance."

Specifically, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) mUTE sequence to acquire signals from water, fat, and short-T2 components (e.g., bones) simultaneously in a single acquisition. The proposed mUTE sequence integrates 3D UTE with multi-echo Dixon acquisitions and uses sparse radial trajectories to accelerate imaging speed. Errors in the radial k-space trajectories are measured using a special k-space trajectory mapping sequence and corrected for image reconstruction. A physical compartmental model is used to fit the measured multi-echo MR signals to obtain fractions of water, fat and bone components for each voxel, which are then used to estimate the continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated via phantom and in vivo human studies, using LACs from Computed Tomography (CT) as reference. Compared to Dixon- and atlas-based MRAC methods, the proposed method yielded PET images with higher correlation and similarity in relation to the reference. The relative absolute errors of PET activity values reconstructed by the proposed method were below 5% in all of the four lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital), cerebellum, whole white matter and gray matter regions across all subjects (n=6). The proposed mUTE method can generate subject-specific, continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction in PET/MR."

We show that the magnetostriction and MCE crucially depends on the geometrical compatibility of the austenite and martensite phases. Detailed information on the compatibility of both phases has been obtained from the transformation matrix calculated from x-ray diffraction data. The uniqueness of the lattice parameters results in an improved reversibility of the magnetostriction and the MCE. In the thermal hysteresis region of the martensitic transformation, the maximum relative length change is 0.3% and the adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}\approx -10$ K in pulsed magnetic fields. Our results reveal that the approach of geometric compatibility will allow one to design materials with reversible magnetostriction and reversible inverse MCE at a first-order magnetostructural phase transition in shape-memory Heusler alloys."

In the proposed pixel architecture, the photogenerated signal is sampled non-destructively multiple times and the results are averaged. Each signal measurement is statistically independent and by averaging the electronic readout noise is reduced to a level where single photons can be distinguished reliably. A pixel design using this method has been simulated in TCAD and several layouts have been generated for a 180 nm CMOS image sensor process. Using simulations, the noise performance of the pixel has been determined as a function of the number of samples, sense node capacitance, sampling rate, and transistor characteristics. The strengths and the limitations of the proposed design are discussed in detail, including the trade-off between noise performance and readout rate and the impact of charge transfer inefficiency. The projected performance of our first prototype device indicates that single-photon imaging is within reach and could enable ground-breaking performance in many scientific and industrial imaging applications."

We show that, in general, neither the magnitude $E$ nor the direction $e^\alpha$ of the electric field (here interpreted as the observed polarization of light) are parallel transported along the ray. For an extended reference frame around the given light ray, we express the evolution of the direction $e^\alpha$ in terms of the frame's kinematics, proving thereby that its expansion never spoils parallel transport, which bears on the unbiased inference of intrinsic properties of cosmological sources, such as, for instance, the polarization field of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). As an application of the newly derived laws, we consider a simple setup for a gravitational wave (GW) interferometer, showing that, despite the (kinematic) shear induced by the GW, the change in the final interference pattern is negligible since it turns out to be of the order of the ratio of the GW and laser frequencies."

These fields are mostly undetectable by standard diagnostic techniques with finite spatio-temporal resolution due to cancellations of Zeeman polarization signals. Observations of resonance scattering polarization have been considered to overcome these problems. But up to now, observations of scattering polarization lack the necessary combination of high sensitivity and high spatial resolution in order to directly infer the turbulent magnetic structure at the resolution limit of solar telescopes. Here, we report the detection of clear spatial structuring of scattering polarization in a magnetically quiet solar region at disk center in the Sr~{\sc i} 4607~\AA~spectral line on granular scales, confirming theoretical expectations. We find that the linear polarization presents a strong spatial correlation with the local quadrupole of the radiation field. The result indicates that polarization survives the dynamic and turbulent magnetic environment of the middle photosphere and is thereby usable for spatially resolved Hanle observations. This is an important step toward the long-sought goal of directly observing turbulent solar magnetic fields at the resolution limit and investigating their spatial structure."

The asymmetry is contributed by the convolution of the Sivers function and the unpolarized fragmentation function. Specifically, the Sivers function in the coordinate space and perturbative region can be represented as the convolution of the $C$-coefficients and the corresponding collinear correlation functions, among which the Qiu-Sterman function is the most relevant one. We perform a detailed phenomenological analysis of the Sivers asymmetry at the kinematics of the HERMES and the COMPASS measurements. It is found that the obtained $x_B$-, $z_h$- and $P_{h\perp}$-dependent asymmetries are basically consistent with the HERMES and the COMPASS measurements."

Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$ has been proposed to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal and provides an excellent platform to study the coupling between Weyl fermions and magnons. Here, we report comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on single crystals of Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$, which have been well characterized by magnetization and magnetotransport measurements, both of which demonstrate that the material is a topologically nontrivial semimetal. The INS spectra clearly show a spin gap of $\sim6$ meV. The dispersion in the magnetic Mn layer extends up to about 76 meV, while that between the layers has a narrow band width of 6 meV. We find that the linear spin-wave theory using a Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian can reproduce the experimental spectra with the following parameters: a nearest-neighbor ($SJ_1\sim28.0$ meV) and next-nearest-neighbor in-plane exchange interaction ($SJ_2\sim9.3$ meV) , interlayer exchange coupling ($SJ_c\sim-0.1$ meV), and spin anisotropy constant ($SD\sim-0.07$ meV). Despite the coexistence of Weyl fermions and magnons, we find no clear evidence that the magnetic dynamics are influenced by the Weyl fermions in Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$, possibly because that the Weyl fermions and magnons reside in the Sb and Mn layers separately, and the interlayer coupling is weak due to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the material, as also evident from the small $SJ_c$ of -0.1 meV."

However, any source of cosmic positrons is inevitably the source of gamma radiation. The least model dependent test of CR anomalies interpretation via DM particles decays (or annihilation) is connected with gamma-ray background due to gamma overproduction in such processes. In this work, we impose an observational constraint on gamma ray production from DM. Then, we study the possible suppression of gamma yield in the DM decays into identical final fermions. Such DM particles arise in the multi-component dark atom model. The influence of the interaction vertices on the gamma suppression was also considered. No essential gamma suppression effects are found. However, some minor ones are revealed."

One of its most interesting properties is the unsaturated giant magnetoresistance that it exhibits at low temperatures. An important question is the degree to which this property can be ascribed to a conventional semi-metallic model in which a highly compensated, high mobility metal exhibits large magnetoresistance. Here we show that the longitudinal thermopower (Seebeck effect) of semi-metallic WTe$_2$ exfoliated flakes exhibits periodic sign changes about zero with increasing magnetic field that indicates distinct electron and hole Landau levels and nearly fully compensated electron and hole carrier densities. However, inconsistent with a conventional semi-metallic picture, we find a rapid enhancement of the Nernst effect at low temperatures that is nonlinear in magnetic field, which is consistent with Weyl points in proximity to the Fermi energy. Hence, we demonstrate the role played by the Weyl character of WTe$_2$ in its transport properties."

While the early works of Fukuta and Lee (1986) and Baker (1991) indicated that it might be irrelevant, the more recent study of Prabhakaran et al. (2019) [arXiv:1906.06129] suggested otherwise. In this work, we are aiming to quantify the ice-nucleating potential using high-fidelity flow simulation techniques around a single hydrometeor and use favorable considerations to upscale the effects to a collective of ice particles in clouds. While we find that ice nucleation may be enhanced in the vicinity of a warm hydrometeor by several orders of magnitude and that the affected volume of air is much larger than previously estimated, it is very unlikely that this effect alone causes the rapid enhancement of ice nucleation observed in some types of clouds, mainly due to the low initial volumetric ice concentration. Nonetheless, it is suggested to implement this effect into existing cloud models in order to investigate second-order effects such as ice nucleus preactivation or enhancement after the onset of glaciation."

The tensor field is implemented in the open source micromagnetic and magnetostatic simulation framework MagTense and compared with the obtained magnetic field from an FEM solution, showing excellent agreement. This result is important for modeling magnetostatics in general and for micromagnetism in particular as the demagnetizing field of an arbitrary body discretized using conventional meshing techniques is significantly simplified with this approach."

We analyze the critical behavior of the black hole by considering the known relationship between pressure and cosmological constant. We show that the black hole admits a first order phase transition and, both rotation and perfect fluid dark matter parameters have a significant impact on the critical quantities. We also introduce a new ad hoc pressure related to the perfect fluid dark matter and find a first order van der Waals like phase transition. In addition, using the sixth order WKB method, we investigate the massless scalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) for the static spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by dark matter. Using the finite difference scheme, the dynamical evolution of the QNMs is also discussed for different values of angular momentum and overtone parameters."

We have recently developed a method which combines stellar photometric data with Gaia DR2 parallax measurements in a Bayesian framework to infer the distances of nearby dust clouds to a typical accuracy of $\sim5\%$. After refining the technique to target lower latitudes and incorporating deep optical data from DECam in the southern Galactic plane, we have derived a catalog of distances to molecular clouds in Reipurth (2008, Star Formation Handbook, vols I and II) which contains a large fraction of the molecular material in the solar neighborhood. Comparison with distances derived from maser parallax measurements towards the same clouds shows our method produces consistent distances with $\lesssim10\%$ scatter for clouds across our entire distance spectrum (150 pc $-$ 2.5 kpc). We hope this catalog of homogeneous distances will serve as a baseline for future work."

That is, we examine the axial symmetry of stars at vertical heights $z$, $0.2 \le |z| \le 3$ kpc, to probe the quality of the angular momentum $L_z$ as an integral of motion. The failure of this symmetry test would speak to a Milky Way, in both its visible and dark matter, that is not isolated and/or not in steady state. The left-right symmetry-breaking pattern we have observed, north and south, reveals both effects, with a measured deviation from symmetry of typically 0.5%. We show that a prolate form of the gravitational distortion of the Milky Way by the Large Magellanic Cloud, determined from fits to the Orphan stream by Erkal et al., 2019, is compatible with the size and sign of the axial-symmetry-breaking effects we have discovered in our sample of up to 14.4 million main-sequence stars, speaking to a distortion of an emergent, rather than static, nature."

We seek to study the variability of four maser transitions of three different species in G107.298+5.639 to constrain the dominant mechanism of periodic flares. Light curves of the 6.7 GHz methanol and 22.2 GHz water vapour maser were obtained with the Torun 32m radio telescope over 39 and 34 cycles, respectively. The target was also monitored at the 1.6 GHz hydroxyl transitions with the Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope over 13 cycles. All these maser lines were imaged using VLBI arrays. The study confirms alternating flares of the methanol and water masers with a period of 34.4d and reveals the synchronised behaviour of the methanol and hydroxyl masers in this source. The observed spatial distribution of the methanol maser cloudlets and the measured time delays of the flares of individual features imply a ring-like structure of radius 240au and thickness 30au. Internal proper motions indicate that the velocity of methanol cloudlets is dominated by a disc-wind component of about 5km/s. The methanol emission detected during only one VLBI observation is located in a region about 550au from a central star, which also exhibits OH maser flares. The erratic appearance of methanol features can be related to a powering object of relatively low luminosity which, during some variability cycles, can excite molecules only in the nearest part of the disc. A careful analysis of the maser and infrared light curves reveal a strong correlation between the 6.7 GHz line and the infrared flux densities supporting a radiative pumping of the maser. The synchronised behaviour of the hydroxyl and methanol transitions indicates a common pumping mechanism for the periodic flares of G107.298+5.639."

An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a trace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such as the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This paper introduces two methods for the bridge system identification using data collected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle suspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency domain. The first approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the second uses EEMD method. Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted using second-order blind identification (SOBI) method. After these two processes the resulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the bridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identification using mobile sensor data has been recently introduced as STRIDEX algorithm. The processed mobile sensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the bridge. The performance of the methods is validated on numerical case studies of a long single-span bridge monitored via a network of moving vehicles. The analyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that the proposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and produce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study shows that the proposed transfer function method can efficiently deconvolve the linear dynamics of a moving vehicle.

In practice, the presence of the transition metals surrounded by carefully designed ligands allows the fine tuning of the emission frequency as well as a good efficiency of the device. To support the development of new compounds the experimental measurements are generally compared with ab-initio calculation of the absorption and emission spectra. The standard approach for these calculations is TDDFT with hybrid exchange and correlation functional like the B3LYP. Due to the size of these compounds the application of more complex quantum chemistry approaches can be challenging. In this work we used Many Body Perturbation Theory approaches (in particular the GW approximation with the Bethe-Salpeter equation) implemented in gaussian basis sets, to calculate the quasiparticle properties and the adsorption spectra of six cyclometalled Ir(III) complexes going behind TDDFT. In the presented results we compared standard TDDFT simulation with BSE calculations performed on top on perturbative G 0 W 0 and accounting for eigenvalue self consistency. Moreover, in order to investigate in detail the effect of the DFT starting point, we concentrate on Ir(ppy) 3 performing GW-BSE simulations starting from different DFT exchange and correlation potentials."

Regarding the prediction result obtained by the 1D-CNN, we have observed improvement in the accuracy of prediction compared with that obtained by the Kalman filter. Although more investigations are required to conclude that the 1D-CNN can work as a good predictor, the present results suggest that the computational approach based on the deep learning technique may become a versatile method for improving the synchronous accuracy of UTC(NMIJ) relative to UTC."

We solve this scheme of coherent transport in space and time with weighted essentially nonoscillatory methods (WENO). WENO is preferentially used for the determination of highly nonlinear and discontinuous processes including interference effects and phase transitions like Anderson localization of light. The theory determines spatiotemporal characteristics of the scattering mean free path and the transmission cross section that are directly measurable in time-of-flight (ToF) and pump-probe experiments. The results are a measure of the coherence of multiple scattering photons in passive as well as in optically soft random media. Our theoretical results of ToF are instructive in spectral regions where material characteristics such as the scattering mean free path and the diffusion coefficient are methodologically almost insensitive to gain or absorption and to higher-order nonlinear effects. Our method is applicable to OCT and other advanced spectroscopy setups including samples of strongly scattering mono- and polydisperse complex nano- and microresonators.

This would in principle allow us to probe the expansion history within a redshift range which would otherwise be challenging to access. In this note, we critically examine this proposal, and identify a number of important issues which had been previously overlooked. These include difficulties in obtaining reliable SMBH mass estimates and reaching the required angular resolution, and an insufficient knowledge of the accretion dynamics of high-redshift SMBHs. While these issues currently appear to prevent high-redshift SMBH shadows from being used as robust standard rulers, we hope that our flagging them early will help in making this probe theoretically mature by the time it will be experimentally feasible."

In the presence of this field, which has anomalous CP violating interactions with the gravitons, primordial gravitational waves induce gravitational anomalies, which in turn are responsible for the appearance of $H^2$ and $H^4$ contributions to the vacuum energy density, these terms being characteristic of generic ""running-vacuum-model (RVM) type"", where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. In this work we prove in detail the appearance of the $H^4$ terms due to gravitational-anomaly-induced condensates in the energy density of the primordial Universe, which can self-consistently induce inflation, and subsequent exit from it, according to the generic features of RVM. We also argue in favour of the robustness of our results, which were derived within an effective low-energy field theory approach, against Ultra Violet completion of the theory. During the radiation and matter-dominated eras, gravitational anomalies cancel, as required for the consistency of the quantum matter/radiation field theory. However, chiral and QCD-axion-type anomalies survive and have important consequences for both cosmic magnetogenesis and axionic dark matter in the Universe. Finally, the stringy RVM scenario presented here predicts quintessence-like dynamical dark energy for the current Universe, which is compatible with the existing fitting analyses of such model against observations"

The two-fold parallelisation of the $\mathcal{O}(N_\mathrm{part}^2)$ force loops and the substep divisions of the extrapolation method allows for a parallel scaling up to $N_\mathrm{CPU} = 0.2 \times N_\mathrm{part}$. The efficient parallel scaling of MSTAR makes the accurate integration of much larger particle numbers possible compared to the traditional algorithmic regularisation chain (AR-CHAIN) methods, e.g. $N_\mathrm{part} = 5000$ particles on $400$ CPUs for $1$ Gyr in a few weeks of wall-clock time. We present applications of MSTAR on few particle systems, studying the Kozai mechanism and N-body systems like star clusters with up to $N_\mathrm{part} =10^4$ particles. Combined with a tree or a fast multipole based integrator the high performance of MSTAR removes a major computational bottleneck in simulations with regularised subsystems. It will enable the next generation galactic-scale simulations with up to $10^9$ stellar particles (e.g. $m_\star = 100 M_\odot$ for a $M_\star = 10^{11} M_\odot$ galaxy) including accurate collisional dynamics in the vicinity of nuclear supermassive black holes."

The present work will seek to achieve this goal via a complex networks approach. This approach will allow finding latent clusters of similar terror groups using information on their operational characteristics. Specifically, using open access data of terrorist attacks occurred worldwide from 1997 to 2016, we build a multi-partite network that includes terrorist groups and related information on tactics, weapons, targets, active regions. We propose a novel algorithm for cluster formation that expands our earlier work that solely used Gower's coefficient of similarity via the application of Von Neumann entropy for mode-weighting. This novel approach is compared with our previous Gower-based method and a heuristic clustering technique that only focuses on groups' ideologies. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the entropy-based approach tends to reliably reflect the structure of the data that naturally emerges from the baseline Gower-based method. Additionally, it provides interesting results in terms of behavioral and ideological characteristics of terrorist groups. We furthermore show that the ideology-based procedure tends to distort or hide existing patterns. Among the main statistical results, our work reveals that groups belonging to opposite ideologies can share very common behaviors and that Islamist/jihadist groups hold peculiar behavioral characteristics with respect to the others. Limitations and potential work directions are also discussed, introducing the idea of a dynamic entropy-based framework."

The fragmentation dynamics of the dication is unraveled by the use of advanced ion and electron spectroscopy giving access to the dissociation channels as well as their energetics. To get insight into the fragmentation dynamics, we use a theoretical approach combining potential energy surface determination, statistical fragmentation methods and molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the dissociation dynamics of adamantane dications takes place in a two-step process: barrierless cage opening followed by Coulomb repulsion-driven fragmentation."

We revise the general UV and optical emission line properties of core-ERQ in the context of the AGN orientation-based unification scenario. We use diagnostic diagrams based on ultraviolet (UV) emission line ratios and UV-optical line kinematic information to compare the physical and kinematic gas properties of core-ERQ with those of other luminous narrow and broad line AGN. In particular, we provide a revised comparison of the [OIII] kinematics in 21 core-ERQ with other samples of quasars matched in luminosity with the aim of evaluating whether core-ERQ host the most extreme [OIII] outflows.   The UV line ratios suggest that the physical properties (for instance, density, metallicity) of the ionised gas in core-ERQ are similar to those observed in the BLR of blue Nitrogen-loud QSOs. The [OIII] outflow velocities of core-ERQ are, on average, consistent with those of very luminous blue QSO1, although extreme outflows are much more frequent in core-ERQ. These similarities can be explained in the context of the AGN unification model, assuming that core-ERQ are viewed with an intermediate orientation between type 2 (edge-on) and type 1 (face-on) QSOs. We propose that core-ERQ are very luminous but otherwise normal quasars viewed at an intermediate orientation. Such orientation allows a direct view of the outer part of the large BLR, from which core-ERQ UV emission originates; the extreme [OIII] outflow velocities are instead a consequence of the very high luminosity of core-ERQ."

Mapping the effects of gas kinetics,"The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are commonly considered to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim to provide disequilibrium chemistry maps for a global understanding of the chemistry in HAT-P-7b's atmosphere and assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.   We apply a hierarchical modelling approach utilising 97 1D atmospheric profiles from 3D GCM of HAT-P-7b. For each 1D profile, we evaluate our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with the local gas-phase composition in chemical equilibrium. We then evaluate quenching results from a zeroth-order approximation in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase approach.   We find that the zeroth-order approach of estimating quenching points agrees well with the full gas-kinetic modeling results. Chemical disequilibrium has the greatest effect on the nightside and morning abundance of species such as H, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all C$_n$H$_m$ molecules; heavier C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by disequilibrium processes. CO abundance, however, is affected only marginally. While dayside abundances also notably change, those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b are the least affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may partially explain the consistency of observed transmission spectra of UHJs with atmospheres in thermochemical equilibrium. Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular abundances and quenching levels.   In general, the quenching points of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere are at much lower pressures in comparison to the cooler hot-jupiters. We propose several avenues to look for the effect of disequilibrium processes on UHJs that are, in general, based on abundance and opacity measurements at different local times. It remains a challenge to completely disentangle this from the chemical effects of clouds and that of a primordial non-solar abundance."

Occurring in the weak Solar Cycle 14 just after its minimum, the extreme space weather event in 1903 October -- November was one of these cases. Here, we reconstruct the time series of geomagnetic activity based on contemporary observational records. With the mid-latitude magnetograms, the 1903 magnetic storm is thought to be caused by a fast coronal mass ejection (~1500 km/s) and is regarded as an intense event with an estimated minimum Dst' of ~-513 nT The reconstructed time series has been compared with the equatorward extension of auroral oval (~44.1{\deg} in invariant latitude) and the time series of telegraphic disturbances. This case study shows that potential threats posed by extreme space weather events exist even during weak solar cycles or near their minima."

In particular, we investigate the chiral response to the one-color multiphoton or strong-field ionization by circularly polarized 400 and 814 nm optical laser pulses or 1850 nm infrared pulse. In addition, the broadband ionization by short coherent circularly polarized 413-1240 nm spanning pulse is considered. Finally, the two-color ionization by the phase-locked 400 and 800 nm pulses, which are linearly polarized in mutually-orthogonal directions, is investigated. The present computational results on the one-color multiphoton ionization of fenchone are in agreement with the available experimental data. For the ionization of fenchone by broadband and bichromatic pulses, the present theoretical study predicts substantial multiphoton PECDs."

We use these data along with resolved CO line intensities from $J_\mathrm{up} = 1$ to 7 to interpret what phase of the interstellar medium the [CI] lines trace within typical local galaxies. A tight, linear relation is found between the intensities of the CO(4-3) and [CI](2-1) lines; we hypothesize this is due to the similar upper level temperature of these two lines. We modeled the [CI] and CO line emission using large velocity gradient models combined with an empirical template. According to this modeling, the [CI](1-0) line is clearly dominated by the low-excitation component. We determine [CI] to molecular mass conversion factors for both the [CI](1-0) and [CI](2-1) lines, with mean values of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}} = 7.3$ M$_{\mathrm{sun}}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s pc$^{-2}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}} = 34 $ M$_{\mathrm{sun}}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s pc$^{-2}$ with logarithmic root-mean-square spreads of 0.20 and 0.32 dex, respectively. The similar spread of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}}$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ (derived using the CO(2-1) line) suggests that [CI](1-0) may be just as good a tracer of cold molecular gas as CO(2-1) in galaxies of this type. On the other hand, the wider spread of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}}$ and the tight relation found between [CI](2-1) and CO(4-3) suggest that much of the [CI](2-1) emission may originate in warmer molecular gas."

The CHEOPS simulator,"The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a mission dedicated to the search for exoplanetary transits through high precision photometry of bright stars already known to host planets. The telescope will provide the unique capability of determining accurate radii for planets whose masses have already been measured from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. This will allow a first-order characterisation of the planets' internal structure through the determination of the bulk density, providing direct insight into their composition. The CHEOPS simulator has been developed to perform detailed simulations of the data which is to be received from the CHEOPS satellite. It generates accurately simulated images that can be used to explore design options and to test the on-ground data processing, in particular, the pipeline producing the photometric time series. It is, thus, a critical tool for estimating the photometric performance expected in flight and to guide photometric analysis. It can be used to prepare observations, consolidate the noise budget, and asses the performance of CHEOPS in realistic astrophysical fields that are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Images generated by CHEOPSim take account of many detailed effects, including variations of the incident signal flux and backgrounds, and detailed modelling of the satellite orbit, pointing jitter and telescope optics, as well as the CCD response, noise and readout. The simulator results presented in this paper have been used in the context of validating the data reduction processing chain, in which image time series generated by CHEOPSim were used to generate light curves for simulated planetary transits across real and simulated targets. Independent analysts were successfully able to detect the planets and measure their radii to an accuracy within the science requirements of the mission."

We show that the emergent helical states known to appear on the triangular AB-BA domain boundary do not actually form a percolating network, but instead they provide independent, perfect one-dimensional channels propagating in three different directions. Using the continuum-model Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that an applied bias causes two well-defined energy windows which contain sparsely distributed one-dimensional channels. The origin of these energy windows can be understood using a two-band model of the intersecting electron and hole bands of single layer graphene. We also use the tight-binding model to implement the lattice deformations in twisted bilayer graphene, and discuss the effect of lattice relaxation on the one-dimensional channels."

A significant enhancement of the stability of the stripe phase with respect to the mean-field prediction is observed when the strength of the inter-atomic correlations is increased.

In high-performance thermoelectric materials, there are two main low thermal conductivity mechanisms: the phonon anharmonic in PbTe and SnSe and phonon scattering resulting from the dynamic disorder in AgCrSe2 and CuCrSe2, which have been successfully revealed by inelastic neutron scattering. Using neutron scattering and ab initio calculations, we report here a mechanism of static local structure distortion combined with phonon-anharmonic-induced ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in {\alpha}-MgAgSb. Since the transverse acoustic phonons are almost fully scattered by the compound's intrinsic distorted rocksalt sublattice, the heat is mainly transported by the longitudinal acoustic phonons. The ultralow thermal conductivity in {\alpha}-MgAgSb is attributed to its atomic dynamics being altered by the structure distortion, which presents a possible microscopic route to enhance the performance of similar thermoelectric materials."

Studies of galaxy pairs can provide valuable information to jointly understand the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups. Consequently, taking into account the new high precision photo-z surveys, it is important to have reliable and tested methods that allow us to properly identify these systems and estimate their total masses and other properties. Aims. In view of the forthcoming Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) we propose and evaluate the performance of an identification algorithm of projected close isolated galaxy pairs. We expect that the photometric selected systems can adequately reproduce the observational properties and the inferred lensing mass - luminosity relation of a pair of truly bound galaxies that are hosted by the same dark matter halo. Methods. We develop an identification algorithm that considers the projected distance between the galaxies, the projected velocity difference and an isolation criteria in order to restrict the sample to isolated systems. We apply our identification algorithm using a mock galaxy catalog that mimics the features of PAUS. To evaluate the feasibility of our pair finder, we compare the identified photometric samples with a test sample that considers that both members are included in the same halo. Also, taking advantage of the lensing properties provided by the mock catalog, we apply a weak lensing analysis to determine the mass of the selected systems. Results. Photometric selected samples tend to show high purity values, but tend to misidentify truly bounded pairs as the photometric redshift errors increase. Nevertheless, overall properties such as the luminosity and mass distributions are successfully reproduced. We also accurately reproduce the lensing mass - luminosity relation as expected for galaxy pairs located in the same halo."

Magnetic reconnection plays a fundamental role in the energy release and conversion processes taking place during flares. A common approach for investigating particle acceleration is to use test particles in fields derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of reconnection. These MHD simulations use anomalous resistivities that are much larger than the Spitzer resistivity based on Coulomb collisions. The processes leading to enhanced resistivity should also affect the test particles. We explore the link between resistivity and particle orbits building on a previous study using a 2D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection. This paper extends the previous investigation to a 3D magnetic reconnection configuration and to study the effect on test particle orbits. We carried out orbit calculations using a 3D MHD simulation of separator reconnection. We use the relativistic guiding centre approximation including stochastic pitch angle scattering. The effects of varying the resistivity and the models for pitch angle scattering on particle orbit trajectories, final positions, energy spectra, final pitch angle distribution, and orbit duration are all studied in detail. Pitch angle scattering widens collimated beams of orbit trajectories, allowing orbits to access previously unaccessible field lines; this causes final positions to spread to topological structures that were previously inaccessible. Scattered orbit energy spectra are found to be predominantly affected by the level of anomalous resistivity, with the pitch angle scattering model only playing a role in isolated cases. Scattering is found to play a crucial role in determining the pitch angle and orbit duration distributions."

Up to now, most of our knowledge about magnetar sources came from spectral analysis, which allowed to test the resonant Compton scattering scenario and to probe the structure of the star magnetosphere. On the other hand, radiation emitted from magnetar surface is expected to be strongly polarized and its observed polarization pattern bears the imprint of both scatterings onto magnetospheric charges and QED effects as it propagates in the magnetized vacuum around the star. X-ray polarimeters scheduled to fly in the next years will finally allow to exploit the wealth of information stored in the polarization observables. Here we revisit the problem of assessing the spectro-polarimetric properties of magnetar persistent emission. At variance with previous investigations, proper account for more physical surface emission models is made by considering either a condensed surface or a magnetized atmosphere. Results are used to simulate polarimetric observations with the forthcoming Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We find that X-ray polarimetry will allow to detect QED vacuum effects for all the emission models we considered and to discriminate among them."

While research has traditionally focused on genetic sources of resistance, recent findings suggest that cancer cells can acquire transient resistant phenotypes via epigenetic modifications and other non-genetic mechanisms. Although these resistant phenotypes are eventually relinquished by individual cells, they can temporarily 'save' the tumor from extinction and enable the emergence of more permanent resistance mechanisms. These observations have generated interest in the potential of epigenetic therapies for long-term tumor control or eradication. In this work, we develop a mathematical model to study how phenotypic switching at the single-cell level affects resistance evolution in cancer. We highlight unique features of non-genetic resistance, probe the evolutionary consequences of epigenetic drugs and explore potential therapeutic strategies. We find that even short-term epigenetic modifications and stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can drive long-term drug resistance in the absence of any bona fide resistance mechanisms. We also find that an epigenetic drug that slightly perturbs the average retention of the resistant phenotype can turn guaranteed treatment failure into guaranteed success. Lastly, we find that combining an epigenetic drug with an anti-cancer agent can significantly outperform monotherapy, and that treatment outcome is heavily affected by drug sequencing."

An integrated agent-based microsimulation platform provides a rich framework for examining such interventions to assess their impacts using indicators about demand as well as supply side. This paper presents an approach, where individual schedules, derived from a lighter version of an activity-based model, are fed into a MATSIM simulation framework. Simulations are performed for two European cities i.e. Hasselt (Belgium), Bologna (Italy). After calibrating the modelling framework against aggregate traffic counts for the base case, the impacts of a few traffic management policies (restricting car access, increase in bus frequency) are examined. The results indicate that restricting car access is more effective in terms of reducing traffic from the network and also shifting car drivers/passengers to other modes of travel. The enhancement of bus infrastructure in relation to increase in frequency caused shifting of bicyclist towards public transport, which is an undesirable result of the policy if the objective is to improve sustainability and environment. In future research, the framework will be enhanced to integrate emission and air dispersion models to ascertain effects on air quality as a result of such interventions."

Whether this so-called dearth region is a peculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. Our goal is to measure stellar rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of K2 stars, located in different fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light on the relation between stellar rotation and photometric variability. We use Lomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability range from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution. Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in 29,860 stars. For effective temperatures below 6000K, the variability range shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of 750 Myr. Additionally, the K2 rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region is less pronounced compared to the Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. We conclude that the period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability on the rotation period."

Many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data storage and analytics capabilities in the cloud. This raises the following problems: (i) the processing stages in IoT applications need to have separate implementations for both the edge and the cloud, (ii) the placement of computation is inflexible with separate software stacks, as the optimal deployment decisions need to be made at runtime, and (iii) unified fault tolerance is essential in case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity problems, malicious harming of edge devices, or harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant architecture CEFIoT for IoT applications by adopting state-of-the-art cloud technologies and deploying them also for edge computing. We solve the data fault tolerance issue by exploiting the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified high-performance data replication solution offering a common software stack for both the edge and the cloud. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant management and the advanced functionality allowing on-the-fly automatic reconfiguration of the processing pipeline to handle both hardware and network connectivity based failures."

TADPOLE Challenge participants train their models and algorithms on historical data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants are then required to make forecasts of three key outcomes for ADNI-3 rollover participants: clinical diagnosis, ADAS-Cog 13, and total volume of the ventricles -- which are then compared with future measurements. Strong points of the challenge are that the test data did not exist at the time of forecasting (it was acquired afterwards), and that it focuses on the challenging problem of cohort selection for clinical trials by identifying fast progressors. The submission phase of TADPOLE was open until 15 November 2017; since then data has been acquired until April 2019 from 219 subjects with 223 clinical visits and 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which was used for the evaluation of the participants' predictions. Thirty-three teams participated with a total of 92 submissions. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For diagnosis prediction, the best forecast (team Frog), which was based on gradient boosting, obtained a multiclass area under the receiver-operating curve (MAUC) of 0.931, while for ventricle prediction the best forecast (team EMC1), which was based on disease progression modelling and spline regression, obtained mean absolute error of 0.41% of total intracranial volume (ICV). For ADAS-Cog 13, no forecast was considerably better than the benchmark mixed effects model (BenchmarkME), provided to participants before the submission deadline. Further analysis can help understand which input features and algorithms are most suitable for Alzheimer's disease prediction and for aiding patient stratification in clinical trials."

Intuitively, one might expect such methods to perform less well for highly delocalized systems. In the present work, we apply both canonical CCSD(T) and a variety of localized approximations thereto to a set of expanded porphyrins --- systems that can switch between H\""uckel, figure-eight, and M\""obius topologies under external stimuli. Both minima and isomerization transition states are considered. We find that M\""obius(-like) structures have much stronger static correlation character than the remaining structures, and that this causes significant errors in DLPNO-CCSD(T) and even DLPNO-CCSD(T1) approaches, unless TightPNO cutoffs are employed. If sub-kcal/mol reproduction of canonical relative energies is required even for M\""obius-type systems (or other systems plagued by strong static correlation), then Nagy and Kallay's LNO-CCSD(T) method with ""tight"" settings can provide that, at much greater computational expense than either the PNO-LCCSD(T) or DLPNO-LCCSD(T) approaches but with still a much gentler CPU time scaling than canonical approaches. We would propose the present POLYPYR21 dataset as a benchmark for localized orbital methods, or more broadly, for the ability of lower-level methods to handle energetics with strongly varying degrees of static correlation."

In this work a Lorentz violating extension of general relativity is studied where a nondynamical tensor couples to the Weyl tensor. A family of static and spherically symmetric solutions in vacuum is found, confirming that there are consistent solutions with explicit Lorentz violation in dynamical spacetimes. These solutions produce an unconventional dependence of the gravitational redshift, which, in turn, leads to the first bounds on such nondynamical tensor that do not rely on the physics of the early universe. Moreover, the bounds obtained in this work are competitive with respect to limits on similar nondynamical tensors."

Therefore, a deeper understanding of user dynamics in online social networks is a fundamental problem in computer and information science. One of the effective user dynamics models is the networked oscillation model; it uses a second-order differential equation with Laplacian matrix. Although our previous study indicates that the oscillation model provides us with a minimal but effective model of user interactions, there still remains the open problem as to the existence of a first-order fundamental differential equation that respects the structure of the original network. This paper fills in this gap and shows that, by doubling the dimension of the state space, we can explicitly but naturally construct a fundamental equation that fully respects the structure of the original network."

Neutrino mass is generated in the model via gauge extended inverse seesaw mechanism. We embed the model in a non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ GUT with a purpose of quantifying the results due to the condition $g_{L} \neq g_{R}$. We compare the predicted numerical values of half life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, effective Majorana mass parameter and other lepton number violating parameters for three different cases; (i) for manifest left-right symmetric model ($g_L = g_R$), (ii) for left-right model with spontaneous D parity breaking ($g_L \neq g_R$), (iii) for Pati-Salam symmetry with D parity breaking ($g_L \neq g_R$).

Side chain engineering enables processing of the polymer electrodes from solution, stability in aqueous electrolytes and efficient transport of ionic and electronic charge carriers. We synthesized a 3,3' dialkoxybithiophene homo polymer (p type polymer) with glycol side chains and prepared naphthalene 1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-diimide-dialkoxybithiophene (NDI gT2) copolymers (n type polymer) with either a glycol or zwitterionic side chain on the NDI unit. For the latter, we developed a post-functionalization synthesis to attach the polar zwitterion side chains to the polymer backbone to avoid challenges of purifying polar intermediates. We demonstrate fast and reversible charging of solution processed electrodes for both the p- and n type polymers in aqueous electrolytes, without using additives or porous scaffolds and for films up to micrometers thick. We apply spectroelectrochemistry as an in operando technique to probe the state of charge of the electrodes. This reveals that thin films of the p-type polymer and zwitterion n-type polymer can be charged reversibly with up to two electronic charges per repeat unit (bipolaron formation). We combine thin films of these polymers in a two-electrode cell and demonstrate output voltages of up to 1.4 V with high redox stability. Our findings demonstrate the potential of functionalizing conjugated polymers with appropriate polar side chains to improve specific capacity, reversibility and rate capabilities of polymer electrodes in aqueous electrolytes."

It is demonstrated that if the graphene layers are free to rotate, they prefer to stay co-aligned upon stretching the bottom layer and the regular triangular network of tensile domain walls is formed upon the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition. If the angle between the layers is fixed, the regular triangular network of shear domain walls is observed at zero elongation of the bottom layer. Upon stretching the bottom layer, however, the domain walls transform into the tensile ones and the size of the commensurate domains decreases. We also show that the parameters of the isosceles triangular domain wall network in twisted bilayer graphene under shear strain can be determined through purely geometrical considerations. Experimental analysis of the orientation of domain walls and period of the triangular network would, on the one hand, contribute to understanding of the interlayer interaction of graphene layers, and, on the other hand, serve for detection of relative strains and rotation between the layers. Vice versa external strains can be used to control the parameters of the triangular domain wall network and, therefore, electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene."

In generic binary black hole mergers, the loss of linear momentum imparts a recoil velocity, or a ""kick"", to the remnant black hole. We exploit recent advances in gravitational waveform and remnant black hole modeling to extract information about the kick from the gravitational wave signal. Kick measurements such as these are astrophysically valuable, enabling independent constraints on the rate of second-generation mergers. Further, we show that kicks must be factored into future ringdown tests of general relativity with third-generation gravitational wave detectors to avoid systematic biases. We find that, although little information can be gained about the kick for existing gravitational wave events, interesting measurements will soon become possible as detectors improve. We show that, once LIGO and Virgo reach their design sensitivities, we will reliably extract the kick velocity for generically precessing binaries--including the so-called superkicks, reaching up to 5000 km/s."

However, the need for a fixed phase reference has so far prevented widespread usage in other fields such as semiconductor spectroscopy. Here, we introduce non-stationary quantum state tomography, which adapts the technique to the special requirements of ultrafast spectroscopy.

We examine the 2:1 and 3:1 inner Jupiter and 1:2 and 1:3 outer Neptune resonances and their possible asymmetric librations using a new analytical pendulum model of resonance that includes the simultaneous libration of multiple arguments and their second harmonics. The numerically-derived resonance separatrices are obtained using the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO chaos indicator). We find that the analytical and numerical estimates are in agreement and that resonance width is determined by the first few fundamental resonance modes that librate simultaneously on the resonant timescale. Our results demonstrate that the new pendulum model may be used to ascertain resonance width analytically, and more generally, that the disturbing function for arbitrary inclination is a powerful analytical tool that describes resonance dynamics of low as well as high inclination asteroids in the solar system."

Following up on previous work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational cost of this search, we present an implementation that achieves near real-time computational speed. This is achieved by combining the search efficiency of PSO with a significantly revised and optimized numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical formalism along with additional multi-threaded parallelization layers in a distributed computing framework. For a network of four second-generation detectors with $60$~min data from each, the runtime of the implementation presented here ranges between $\approx 1.4$ to $\approx 0.5$ times the data duration for network signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of $\gtrsim 10$ and $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The reduced runtimes are obtained with small to negligible losses in detection sensitivity: for a false alarm rate of $\simeq 1$~event per year in Gaussian stationary noise, the loss in detection probability is $\leq 5\%$ and $\leq 2\%$ for SNRs of $10$ and $12$, respectively. Using the fast implementation, we are able to quantify frequentist errors in parameter estimation for signals in the double neutron star mass range using a large number of simulated data realizations. A clear dependence of parameter estimation errors and detection sensitivity on the condition number of the network antenna pattern matrix is revealed. Combined with previous work, this paper securely establishes the effectiveness of PSO-based fully-coherent all-sky search across the entire binary inspiral mass range that is relevant to ground-based detectors."

Here we report new high precision palladium isotope data for six iron meteorite groups, which display smaller nucleosynthetic isotope variations than the more refractory neighbouring elements. Based on this observation we present a new model in which thermal destruction of interstellar medium dust results in an enrichment of s-process dominated stardust in regions closer to the Sun. We propose that stardust is depleted in volatile elements due to incomplete condensation of these elements into dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. This led to the smaller nucleosynthetic variations for Pd reported here and the lack of such variations for more volatile elements. The smaller magnitude variations measured in heavier refractory elements suggest that material from high-metallicity AGB stars dominated stardust in the Solar System. These stars produce less heavy s-process elements compared to the bulk Solar System composition."

Nevertheless, such hydrophobic thin films rely only on graphene non-polar surface, rather than taking advantage of its surface roughness. Furthermore, graphene is typically not self-standing. Differently, carbon aerogels have high porosity, large effective surface area due to their surface roughness, and very low mass density, which make them a promising candidate as a super-hydrophobic material for novel technological applications. However, despite a few works reporting the general super-hydrophobic and lipophilic behavior of the carbon aerogels, a detailed characterization of their wetting properties is still missing, to date. Here, the wetting properties of graphene aerogels are demonstrated in detail. Without any chemical functionalization or patterning of their surface, the samples exhibit a super-lipophilic state and a stationary super-hydrophobic state with a contact angle up to $150\pm15^{\deg}$ and low contact angle hysteresis $\approx15^{\deg}$, owing to the fakir effect. In addition, the adhesion force of the graphene aerogels in contact with the water droplets and their surface tension are evaluated. For instance, the unique wettability and enhanced liquid absorption of the graphene aerogels can be exploited for reducing contamination from oil spills and chemical leakage accidents."

Very few such objects are known, which makes WASP-128 a prime target for further observations to better understand giant planet / brown dwarf properties,including formation and migration histories. To facilitate the planning of future observations of WASP-128b, we improve the orbital ephemeris of the system, by using the seven transits of WASP-128 observed by TESS. We note that our orbital period differs significantly from that of H18: it is more than $14\,\sigma$ (using their uncertainty) larger. This results in our ephemeris predicting a mid-2020 transit to occur almost eight hours later than the H18 ephemeris. We find, however, no evidence for any period variation."

The compound's crystal structure contains bond-alternating [Mn$_3$O$_{11}$]$^{\infty}$ chains along the $b$-axis, formed by isosceles triangles of Mn ions occupying two crystallographically nonequivalent sites (Mn1 site on the base and Mn2 site on the vertex). These chains are only weakly linked to each other by nonmagnetic oxyanions. Both SQUID magnetometry and neutron diffraction experiments show two successive magnetic transitions as a function of temperature. On cooling, it transitions from a paramagnetic phase into an incommensurate phase below 4.5~K with a magnetic wavevector near ${\bf k}_{1} = (0,~0.46,~0)$. An additional commensurate antiferromagnetically ordered component arises with ${\bf k}_{2} = (0,~0,~0)$, forming a complex magnetic structure below 3.5~K with two different propagation vectors of different stars. On further cooling, the incommensurate wavevector undergoes a lock-in transition below 2.3~K. The experimental results suggest that the magnetic superspace group is $Pnma.1'(0b0)s0ss$ for the single-${\bf k}$ incommensurate phase and is $Pn'ma(0b0)00s$ for the 2-${\bf k}$ magnetic phase. We propose a simplified magnetic structure model taking into account the major ordered contributions, where the commensurate ${\bf k}_{2}$ defines the ordering of the $c$-axis component of Mn1 magnetic moment, while the incommensurate ${\bf k}_{1}$ describes the ordering of the $ab$-plane components of both Mn1 and Mn2 moments into elliptical cycloids"

The Coolest and Lowest Mass Members of the Serpens-South Star-forming Region,"Given its relative proximity (~430 pc), compact size (< 20'), young age (~ 0.5 Myr) and rich number of young stellar objects, the Serpens-South star forming region is a promising site for studying young sub-stellar objects, yet the low-mass members of this region remain largely undiscovered. In this paper we report on a deep photometric survey using a custom 1.45 um filter (W-band), as well as standard J and H near-IR filters, in order to identify candidate low-mass young brown-dwarfs in the Serpens-South region. We constructed a reddening-insensitive index (Q) by combining J, H and W-band photometry for survey objects, in order to identify candidate low-mass members of Serpens based on the strength of the water absorption feature at 1.45 um in the atmospheres of mid-M and later objects. We then conducted spectroscopic follow up to confirm youth and spectral type for our candidates. This is the first survey to identify the very low-mass and coolest members of Serpens-South. We identify 4 low-mass candidate Serpens members, which all display IR excess emission, indicating the likely presence of circumstellar disks around them. One of the four candidate low-mass members in our list, SERP182918-020245, exhibits Pa_beta and Br_gamma emission features, confirming its youth and ongoing magnetospheric accretion. Our new candidate members have spectral types >M4 and are the coolest and lowest mass candidate members yet identified in Serpens-South."

Current implementations of these two models represent the two extreme cases of communication resource sharing in modern MPI implementations. In the MPI-everywhere model, each MPI process has a dedicated set of communication resources (also known as endpoints), which is ideal for performance but is resource wasteful. With MPI+threads, current MPI implementations share a single communication endpoint for all threads, which is ideal for resource usage but is hurtful for performance.   In this paper, we explore the tradeoff space between performance and communication resource usage in MPI+threads environments. We first demonstrate the two extreme cases---one where all threads share a single communication endpoint and another where each thread gets its own dedicated communication endpoint (similar to the MPI-everywhere model) and showcase the inefficiencies in both these cases. Next, we perform a thorough analysis of the different levels of resource sharing in the context of Mellanox InfiniBand. Using the lessons learned from this analysis, we design an improved resource-sharing model to produce \emph{scalable communication endpoints} that can achieve the same performance as with dedicated communication resources per thread but using just a third of the resources."

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots."

The concept of graphs assumes that the relations within the network are binary (for instance, between pairs of nodes); however, this is not always true for many real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes, paper co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often the case that the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a single (hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers to have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks; hence, they are extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle dependencies in such data structures.   Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it possible to perform operations on them, from basic algorithms (such as searching or traversing the network) to computing significant hypergraph measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community detection). In this paper, we present a new software library, SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language and designed for high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation.   We also present various approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated into our tool. In order to demonstrate how to exploit the library in practice, we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset and the collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are promising and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight than standard graph-based approaches."

The ion chain is placed in a harmonic trap with an additional periodic potential which dimensionless amplitude $K$ determines three main phases available for quantum computations: at zero $K$ we have the case of Cirac-Zoller quantum computer, below a certain critical amplitude $K<K_c$ the ions are in the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) phase, with delocalized phonon modes and free chain sliding, and above the critical amplitude $K>K_c$ ions are in the pinned Aubry phase with a finite frequency gap protecting quantum gates from temperature and other external fluctuations. For the Aubry phase, in contrast to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM phases, the phonon gap remains independent of the number of ions placed in the trap keeping a fixed ion density around the trap center. We show that in the Aubry phase the phonon modes are much better localized comparing to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM cases. Thus in the Aubry phase the recoil pulses lead to local oscillations of ions while in other two phases they spread rapidly over the whole ion chains making them rather sensible to external fluctuations. We argue that the properties of localized phonon modes and phonon gap in the Aubry phase provide advantages for the ion quantum computations in this phase with a large number of ions."

This class of interacting model with pure momentum exchange introduces modifications to the standard model in the level of perturbation. We investigate the model by comparing to observational data, including integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlation, galaxy power spectrum, $f \sigma_8$, and CMB data. It is shown that this model can alleviate the observed tension between local and global measurements of $\sigma_8$. According to our results, the best fit value of $\sigma_8$ for interacting model is $0.700$, which is lower than the one for $\Lambda$CDM model and also is consistent with low redshift observations. Furthermore, we perform a forecast analysis to find the constraints on parameters of the interacting model from future experiments."

Contrary to wide expectations for quantum gravity, our semiclassical field equations have an exact scale invariance, as do the classical field equations. As one would then expect, we numerically find that the phase transition is second order, again as in the classical case."

In this paper bit error rate of an image, signal is transmitted over fading channel is analyzed using orthogonal frequency multiplexing and channel estimation technique. An Orthogonal Frequency Multiplexing (OFDM) provides prominent bandwidth effectiveness and improved immunity to the fading environments. In OFDM, the data is modulated using multiple numbers of subcarriers that are orthogonal to each other. A cyclic prefix is infixed between OFDM symbols to annihilate the inter symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). The least square channel estimation method is used to minimize the effect of multipath fading. An image, signal is modulated using BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM digital modulation schemes with OFDM and channel estimation and transmitted over AWGN and fading channel. The objective of this work is to improve the signal to noise ratio by reducing interference."

In the context of robot grasping the use of common object sets has emerged in recent years, however no dominant protocols and metrics to test grasping pipelines have taken root yet. In this paper, we present version 1.0 of GRASPA, a benchmark to test effectiveness of grasping pipelines on physical robot setups. This approach tackles the complexity of such pipelines by proposing different metrics that account for the features and limits of the test platform. As an example application, we deploy GRASPA on the iCub humanoid robot and use it to benchmark our grasping pipeline. As closing remarks, we discuss how the GRASPA indicators we obtained as outcome can provide insight into how different steps of the pipeline affect the overall grasping performance."

The recent discoveries of two-dimensional ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials have ignited tremendous research interest and aroused hope to search for two-dimensional multiferroics. However, intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic materials and, particularly, those with strong magnetoelectric couplings are still rare to date. In this paper, using first-principles simulations, we propose artificial two-dimensional multiferroics via a van der Waals heterostructure formed by ferromagnetic bilayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) and ferroelectric monolayer Sc2CO2. In addition to the coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, our calculations show that, by switching the electric polarization of Sc2CO2, we can tune the interlayer magnetic couplings of bilayer CrI3 between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. We further reveal that such a strong magnetoelectric effect is from a dramatic change of the band alignment induced by the strong build-in electric polarization in Sc2CO2 and the subsequent change of the interlayer magnetic coupling of bilayer CrI3. These artificial multiferroics and enhanced magnetoelectric effect give rise to realizing multifunctional nanoelectronics by van der Waals heterostructures."

The data were acquired with the new imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SITELLE mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We obtained three spectral cubes with R=10'000 (SN1 filter), 1500 (SN2 filter) and 600 (SN3 filter), centered on the Pillars of Creation and the HH216 flow, covering the main optical nebular emission lines: [O II]3726,29 (SN1), Hb, [O III]4959,5007 (SN2), [N II]6548,84, Ha, and [S II]6717,31 (SN3). We validate the performance, calibration, and data reduction of SITELLE, and analyze the structures in the large field-of-view in terms of their kinematics and nebular emission. We compared the SITELLE data to MUSE integral field observations and other spectroscopic and narrow-band imaging data to validate the performance of SITELLE. We computed gas-phase metallicities via the strong-line method, performed a pixel-by-pixel fit to the main emission lines to derive kinematics of the ionized gas, computed the mass-loss rate of the Eastern pillar (the Spire), and combined the SITELLE data with near-infrared narrow-band imaging to characterize the HH216 flow. The comparison with previously published fluxes demonstrates very good agreement. We disentangle the dependence of the gas-phase metallicities (derived via abundance-tracing line ratios) on the degree of ionization and obtain metallicities that are in excellent agreement with the literature. We confirm the bipolar structure of HH216, find evidence for episodic accretion from the source of the flow, and identify its likely driving source. We compute the mass-loss rate of the Spire pillar on the East side of the H II region and find excellent agreement with the correlation between the mass-loss rate and the ionizing photon flux from the nearby cluster NGC6611."

The system consists of a 10-mm-long periodically poled KTP crystal placed in a double-resonant bow-tie cavity and pumped by a fiber laser at 1064.5 nm and a Ti:sapphire laser at 849.2 nm. An optical power of 375 mW at 472.4 nm in a TEM$_{00}$ mode was generated with pump powers of 250 mW at 849.2 nm and 200 mW at 1064.5 nm coupled into the double-resonant ring resonator with 88$\%$ mode-matching. The resulting internal conversion efficiency of 95($\pm 3$)$\%$ of the photons mode-matched to the cavity constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the highest overall achieved quantum conversion efficiency using continuous-wave pumping. Very high conversion efficiency is rendered possible due to very low intracavity loss on the level of 0.3$\%$ and high nonlinear conversion coefficient up to 0.045(0.015) W$^{-1}$. Power stability measurements performed over one hour show a stability of 0.8$\%$. The generated blue light can be tuned within 5 nm around the center wavelength of 472.4 nm, limited by the phase-matching of our nonlinear crystal. This can however be expanded to cover the entire blue spectrum (420 nm to 510 nm) by proper choice of nonlinear crystals and pump lasers. Our experimental results agree very well with analytical and numerical simulations taking into account cavity impedance matching and depletion of the pump fields."

We confirm a so far unexplained lithium abundance decrease at supersolar metallicities - $A$(Li) in our sample stars, which drop by 0.7 dex in the [Fe/H] range from +0.10 to +0.55 dex. Furthermore, we identified stars with similar ages, atmospheric parameters, and rotational velocities, but with significantly different lithium abundances, which suggests that additional specific evolutionary factors should be taken into account while interpreting the stellar lithium content. Nine stars with predominantly supersolar metallicities, i.e. about 12 % among 78 stars with C and O abundances determined, have the C/O number ratios larger than 0.65, thus may form carbon-rich rocky planets. Ten planet-hosting stars, available in our sample, do not show a discernible difference from the stars with no planets detected regarding their lithium content."

Spatially resolved   spectral properties of Lyman alpha haloes around star-forming galaxies at z >   3,"We present spatially resolved maps of six individually-detected Lyman alpha haloes (LAHs) as well as a first statistical analysis of the Lyman alpha (Lya) spectral signature in the circum-galactic medium of high-redshift star-forming galaxies using MUSE. Our resolved spectroscopic analysis of the LAHs reveals significant intrahalo variations of the Lya line profile. Using a three-dimensional two-component model for the Lya emission, we measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM), the peak velocity shift and the asymmetry of the Lya line in the core and in the halo of 19 galaxies. We find that the Lya line shape is statistically different in the halo compared to the core for ~40% of our galaxies. Similarly to object-by-object based studies and a recent resolved study using lensing, we find a correlation between the peak velocity shift and the width of the Lya line both at the interstellar and circum-galactic scales. While there is a lack of correlation between the spectral properties and the spatial scale lengths of our LAHs, we find a correlation between the width of the line in the LAH and the halo flux fraction. Interestingly, UV bright galaxies show broader, more redshifted and less asymmetric Lya lines in their haloes. The most significant correlation found is for the FWHM of the line and the UV continuum slope of the galaxy, suggesting that the redder galaxies have broader Lya lines. The generally broad and red line shapes found in the halo component suggests that the Lya haloes are powered either by scattering processes through an outflowing medium, fluorescent emission from outflowing cold clumps of gas, or a mix of both. Considering the large diversity of the Lya line profiles observed in our sample and the lack of strong correlation, the interpretation of our results is still broadly open and underlines the need for realistic spatially resolved models of the LAHs."

Three initial geometric configurations of $^{12}$C, namely three-$\alpha$-cluster triangle, three-$\alpha$-cluster chain and Woods-Saxon distribution of nucleons, are taken into account, and their effects on the correlations are investigated. The ratio of the third- to the second-order HBT radii $R_{o(s),3}^2/R_{o(s),2}^2$ is shown to be a clear probe for three configurations. In addition, this work presents the hadronic rescattering time evolution of the azimuthally dependent HBT radii. From the present study, one can learn that the HBT correlation from identical particles at freeze-out is able to provide the information of different initial configurations as collective flow proposed before."

To reveal the origin of such high ordering temperature, critical behaviors, electronic structure and crystal-field effects of Gd6FeBi2 are investigated in this work. The short-range Gd-Fe ferrimagnetic interaction is supported by the non-Curie-Weiss paramagnetic behavior, crystal and electronic structure analyses, in agreement with previous DFT calculations. Unlike the strong TM-TM exchange interactions, the Gd-Fe exchange interaction shows limited influence on the critical exponents determined by long-range exchange interactions, which seems a common feature in RE-TM based alloys without TM-TM exchange interactions. However, the strong Gd-Fe hybridization reduces the influence of vibronic couplings on the short-range exchange interaction and thus allows a high Tc. The broadening or splitting mechanism of Gd 4f-electron bands is addressed based on crystal-field analysis and likely another factor for elevated Tc in Gd6FeBi2 and Gd-based compounds with non-magnetic elements. Different magnetic behaviors among isostructural compounds, and the relationship between the band splitting and crystal-field effects is also discussed."

We focus our analysis on various recently presented pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) models [J.~Chem.~Phys., 23, 234105 (2016) and J.~Chem.~Theory~Comput. 15, 18--24 (2019)] and compare their performance to the conventional EOM-CCSD approach and to the completely renormalized EOM-CCSD with perturbative triples ansatz. Since the single-reference pCCD model allows us to efficiently describe static/nondynamic electron correlation, while dynamical electron correlation is accounted for \textit{a posteriori}, the investigated pCCD-based methods represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Such a feature is particularly advantageous when modelling electronic structures of actinide-containing compounds with stretched bonds. Our work demonstrates that EOM-pCCD-based methods reliably predict electronic spectra of small actinide building blocks containing thorium, uranium, and protactinium atoms. Specifically, the standard errors in adiabatic and vertical excitation energies obtained by the conventional EOM-CCSD approach are reduced by a factor of 2 when employing the EOM-pCCD-LCCSD variant resulting in a mean error of 0.05 eV and a standard deviation of 0.25 eV."

Statistical   properties of the 22 GHz H2O masers,"We wish to perform a statistical study of the location and motion of individual 22 GHz water maser cloudlets, characterized by sizes that are within a few au, with respect to the radio thermal emission from young stellar objects (YSO). For this purpose, we have been carrying out the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey of a sample (38) of high-mass YSOs. The water maser positions and three-dimensional (3D) velocities were determined through Very Long Baseline Array observations with accuracies of a few milliarcsec (mas) and a few km/s, respectively. The position of the ionized core of the protostellar wind, marking the YSO, was determined through sensitive continuum Jansky Very Large Array observations with a typical error of 20 mas. The statistic of the separation of the water masers from the radio continuum shows that 84% of the masers are found within 1000 au from the YSO and 45% of them are within 200 au. Therefore, we can conclude that the 22 GHz water masers are a reliable proxy for the YSO position. The distribution of maser luminosity is strongly peaked towards low values, indicating that about half of the maser population is still undetected with the current Very Long Baseline Interferometry detection thresholds of 50-100 mJy/beam. Next-generation, sensitive radio interferometers will exploit these weak masers for an improved sampling of the velocity and magnetic fields around the YSOs. The average direction of the water maser proper motions provides a statistically-significant estimate for the orientation of the jet emitted by the YSO: 55% of the maser proper motions are directed on the sky within an angle of 30 deg from the jet axis. Finally, we show that our measurements of 3D maser velocities statistically support models in which water maser emission arises from planar shocks with propagation direction close to the plane of the sky."

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient. Therefore the progressive tax-like norm function has the highest sustainability and fairness."

TLP technique, combined with DC and pulsed I-V characterization, is performed to study the contribution of trap states on current conduction in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with an HfAlO stack. The importance of the above mentioned methods is demonstrated by comparing two generations of samples with slightly different charge trapping mechanisms; their impact on the current conduction is furthermore studied by decreasing the pulse width down to 50nsec. TLP analysis is finally discussed as interesting method to investigate the influence of trap states on the device robustness. The evaluation of breakdown voltage for different time pulses allows to discriminate whether different failure mechanisms occur or not and to establish the impact of trap states on short-term reliability."

This development is considered key in the hunt for low-mass rocky exoplanets around solar-type stars whose discovery with the radial-velocity method requires cm/s Doppler precision. In order to prove such precise calibration with an LFC, it must be compared to another calibrator of at least the same precision. Being the best available spectrograph calibrator, this means comparing it to a second - fully independent - LFC. This test had long been pending, but our installation of two LFCs at the ultra-stable spectrograph HARPS presented the so far unique opportunity for simultaneous calibrations with two separate LFCs. Although limited in time, the test results confirm the 1 cm/s stability that has long been anticipated by the astronomical community."

Fuel cell conditions were replicated by depositing a film of Pt/Vulcan XC-72 catalyst onto the disk and by varying the temperature, dissolved O2 concentration and the acidity levels in hydrochloric acid (HClO4). The HClO4 acidity was correlated to ionomer water activity and hence fuel cell humidity. The H2O2 formation rates showed a linear dependence on oxygen concentration and square dependence on water activity. The H2O2 selectivity in ORR was independent of oxygen concentration but increased with decrease in water activity (i.e., decreased humidity). Potential dependent activation energy for the H2O2 formation reaction was estimated from data obtained at different temperatures."

The nonlocality makes it difficult to understand the renormalization and improvement of these operators using standard methods. In previous work, we showed that by introducing an auxiliary field on the lattice, one can understand an on-axis Wilson-line operator as the product of two local operators in an extended theory. In this paper, we provide details about the calculation in perturbation theory of the factor for conversion from our lattice-suitable renormalization scheme to the MS-bar scheme. Extending our work, we study Symanzik improvement of the extended theory to understand the pattern of discretization effects linear in the lattice spacing, $a$, which are present even if the lattice fermion action exactly preserves chiral symmetry. This provides a prospect for an eventual $O(a)$ improvement of lattice calculations of PDFs. We also generalize our approach to apply to Wilson lines along lattice diagonals and to piecewise-straight link paths."

These patterns can be explained by lateral field distortions, caused by the non-uniform distribution of holes in the channel stops between sensor columns. Over the course of LSST camera development, a number of practical fixes have been suggested to get rid of tearing. But applying these fixes to our 16-channel Teledyne-e2v sensors leaves at best a distortion pattern at the vertical edges of every segment. Our working hypothesis is that the origin of the tearing is the parallel clocking itself, which moves the holes that are present in the channel stops regions. The efficiency of these transfers depends strongly on the details of the clocking operations, resulting in the observed variety of distortion patterns. Removal of most of the distortion patterns can therefore be achieved by executing a purge operation, which flattens back the hole distribution in the channel stops, immediately before acquiring a frame. A more effective solution is to switch all clocking operations to use a bipolar voltage set."

A quasi-biclique in the bigraph is its ""almost"" complete subgraph. The relaxation of completeness can be understood variously; here, we assume that the subgraph is a $\gamma$-quasi-biclique if it lacks a certain number of edges to form a biclique such that its density is at least $\gamma \in (0,1]$. For a bigraph and fixed $\gamma$, the problem of searching for the maximal quasi-biclique consists of finding a subset of vertices of the bigraph such that the induced subgraph is a quasi-biclique and its size is maximal for a given graph. Several models based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to search for a quasi-biclique are proposed and tested for working efficiency. An alternative model inspired by biclustering is formulated and tested; this model simultaneously maximizes both the size of the quasi-biclique and its density, using the least-square criterion similar to the one exploited by triclustering \textsc{TriBox}."

Anticipating and controlling these morphologies is crucial to a variety of applications involving textiles, synthetic skins, and inflatable structures. Here we show that a ""wrinkle-to-crumple"" transition, previously observed in specific settings, is a ubiquitous response for confined sheets. This unified picture is borne out of a suite of model experiments on polymer films confined to liquid interfaces with spherical, hyperbolic, and cylindrical geometries, which are complemented by experiments on macroscopic membranes inflated with gas. We use measurements across this wide range of geometries, boundary conditions, and lengthscales to quantify several robust morphological features of the crumpled phase, and we build an empirical phase diagram for crumple formation that disentangles the competing effects of curvature and compression. Our results suggest that crumples are a generic microstructure that emerge at large curvatures due to a competition of elastic and substrate energies."

It lies inside Wolf-Rayet region in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and possesses a WN8 type spectrum at the light minima. Analysis of Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra obtained in 2016 led to the conclusion that it is surrounded by an unresolved HII region formed mostly of ejected material from the central star, and disclosed the presence of a second, more extended asymmetrical emission region. Aims: The aim of this paper is to further explore the structure of the nearby environment of GR290. Methods: Long-slit spectra of GR290 were obtained with three slit orientations in the visual and red spectral regions. The emission-line distribution for each slit was analyzed. Results: We confirm the presence of an asymmetric HII region that extends ~50 pc to the south; ~30pc to the north and southeast; ~20 pc to the east and northwest and ~10pc to the west.

Other molecules, mainly O$_3$, CO, CO$_2$, C$_3$O, and H$_2$O, were embedded at the same time in the matrices. The annealing procedure caused the cold dopants to diffuse and interact in the neon ice. Monitoring the procedure in situ with infrared spectroscopy revealed the disappearance of the silicon oxide and carbon molecules at temperatures lower than 13 K, and the rise of the Si-O stretching band of silicates. Ex situ electron microscopy confirmed the formation of silicate grains and showed that their structure was amorphous. It also showed that amorphous carbon matter was formed simultaneously next to the silicate grains, the two materials being chemically separated. The results of the experiments support the hypothesis that grains of complex silicates and of carbonaceous materials are re-formed in the cold ISM, as suggested by astronomical observations and evolution models of cosmic dust masses. Moreover, they show that the potential precursors of one material do not combine with those of the other at cryogenic temperatures, providing us with a clue as to the separation of silicates and carbon in interstellar grains."

While existing approaches have accomplished substantial progress, they are mostly limited to processing of one dimensional signals or require parameter tuning to model environmental parameters. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on deep neural networks that simulates changes in the 3D structure of a monitored object in a batch based on previous 3D measurements. In particular, we propose an architecture based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN) in order to model the geometric variations in manufacturing parameters and predict upcoming events related to sub-optimal performance. We validate our framework on a microelectronics use-case using the recently published PCB scans dataset where we simulate changes on the shape and volume of glue deposited on an Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate before the attachment of integrated circuits (IC). Experimental evaluation examines the impact of different choices in the cost function during training and shows that the proposed method can be efficiently used for defect prediction."

Understanding the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance across different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in well-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely well-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by networks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution of lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks, systematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and one-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to the receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on networks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to evolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for the receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world networks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the receiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show that honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed populations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the one-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when the cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly, for lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto white lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of lying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than the benefit for the receiver. In this case again the small-world topology acts as an amplifier of the effect, while other network topologies fail to do the same."

The low water abundances inferred from water observations toward low-mass protostellar objects may point to a rapid locking of water as ice by large dust grains during star and planet formation. However, little is known about the water vapor abundance in newly formed planet-forming disks. We aim to determine the water abundance in embedded Keplerian disks through spatially-resolved observations of H$_2^{18}$O lines to understand the evolution of water during star and planet formation. We present H$_2^{18}$O line observations with ALMA and NOEMA millimeter interferometers toward five young stellar objects. NOEMA observed the 3$_{1,3}$ - $2_{2,0}$ line (E$_{\rm up}$ = 203.7 K) while ALMA targeted the $4_{1,4}$ - $3_{2,1}$ line (E$_{\rm up}$ = 322.0 K). Water column densities are derived considering optically thin and thermalized emission. Our observations are sensitive to the emission from the known Keplerian disks around three out of the five Class I objects in the sample. No H$_2^{18}$O emission is detected toward any of our five Class I disks. We report upper limits to the integrated line intensities. The inferred water column densities in Class I disks are N < 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ on 100 au scales which include both disk and envelope. The upper limits imply a disk-averaged water abundance of $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ with respect to H$_2$ for Class I objects. After taking into account the physical structure of the disk, the upper limit to the water abundance averaged over the inner warm disk with $T>$ 100 K is between 10$^{-7}$ up to 10$^{-5}$. Water vapor is not abundant in warm protostellar envelopes around Class I protostars. Upper limits to the water vapor column densities in Class I disks are at least two orders magnitude lower than values found in Class 0 disk-like structures."

The latter condition is trivially satisfied for two-level systems, while this is generally no longer true for $N$-level systems, with $N > 2$. Focusing on three-level systems, we discuss the occurrence of a unique energy scale factor $\beta_{\rm eff}$ that formally plays the role of an effective inverse temperature in the Jarzynski equality. To this aim, we introduce a suitable parametrization of the initial state in terms of a thermal and a non-thermal component. We determine the value of $\beta_{\rm eff}$ for a large number of measurements and study its dependence on the initial state. Our predictions could be checked experimentally in quantum optics."

In order to do so, we depart from a simple but fully relativistic system of differential equations that describe a compact object in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, and then we make suitable linearizations that apply to nonrelativistic objects such as the Sun. We then show clearly under which conditions the emerging chameleonlike mechanism can lead to a post-Newtonian parameter {\gamma} compatible with the observational bounds. To illustrate this method, we use several specific f(R) models proposed to explain the current acceleration of the Universe, and we show which of them are able to satisfy those bounds."

We present soundness and completeness proofs of a sequent calculus for first-order logic, formalized in the interactive proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Our formalization is based on work by Stefan Berghofer, which we have since updated to use Isabelle's declarative proof style Isar (Archive of Formal Proofs, Entry FOL-Fitting, August 2007 / July 2018). We represent variables with de Bruijn indices; this makes substitution under quantifiers less intuitive for a human reader. However, the nature of natural numbers yields an elegant solution when compared to implementations of substitution using variables represented by strings. The sequent calculus considered has the special property of an always empty antecedent and a list of formulas in the succedent. We obtain the proofs of soundness and completeness for the sequent calculus as a derived result of the inverse duality of its tableau counterpart. We strive to not only present the results of the proofs of soundness and completeness, but also to provide a deep dive into a programming-like approach to the formalization of first-order logic syntax, semantics and the sequent calculus.

Both compounds are isostructural and crystallize in a monoclinic structure with space group $P2_1/c$. The magnetic susceptibility of (1) shows a maximum at $2.23 K$ and of (2) at $2.70 K$, which are attributed to antiferromagnetic phase transitions. Furthermore, the magnetization along the $b$-axis at $1.9 K$ for both compounds shows a spin-flop transition into a new antiferromagnetic phase. This transition occurs at $0.61 T$ for (1) and at $2.0 T$ for (2). The antiferromagnetic order can be suppressed by a magnetic field $B_{C1}= 1.1 T$ for (1) and $B_{C2}= 1.2 T$ for (2). First single crystal neutron diffraction measured on (1) at different temperatures reveals the magnetic signal on the top of the nuclear reflection at (-1 0 0).

This work considers the Virgo cluster of galaxies, focusing on its structure, kinematics, and morphological landscape. Our principal aim is to estimate the virial mass of the cluster. For this purpose, we present a sample of 1537 galaxies with radial velocities $V_{LG} < 2600$~km~s$^{-1}$ situated within a region of $\Delta{}SGL = 30^\circ$ and $\Delta{}SGB = 20^\circ$ around M87. About half of the galaxies have distance estimates.   Methods. We selected 398 galaxies with distances in a $(17\pm5)$~Mpc range. Based on their 1D and 2D number-density profiles and their radial velocity dispersions, we made an estimate for the virial mass of the Virgo cluster.   Results. We identify the infall of galaxies towards the Virgo cluster core along the Virgo Southern Extension filament. From a 1D profile of the cluster, we obtain the virial mass estimate of $(6.3\pm0.9) \times 10^{14} M_\odot, $ which is in tight agreement with its mass estimate via the external infall pattern of galaxies.   Conclusions. We conclude that the Virgo cluster outskirts between the virial radius and the zero-velocity radius do not contain significant amounts of dark matter beyond the virial radius."

""The fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and there was none here: [Mr. Huang] was well aware that the Autopilot was not perfect [and the] only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so."" This is the standard response from Tesla and Uber, the manufacturers of the automated vehicles involved in the six fatal accidents to date: the automated vehicle isn't perfect, the driver knew it wasn't perfect, and if only the driver had been paying attention and heeded the vehicle's warnings, the accident would never have occurred.   However, as researchers focused on human-automation interaction in aviation and military operations, we cannot help but wonder if there really are no broken promises and no legal liabilities. Science has a critical role in determining legal liability, and courts appropriately rely on scientists and engineers to determine whether an accident, or harm, was foreseeable. Specifically, a designer could be found liable if, at the time of the accident, scientists knew there was a systematic relationship between the accident and the designer's untaken precaution.   Nearly 70 years of research provides an undeniable answer: It is insufficient, inappropriate, and dangerous to automate everything you can and leave the rest to the human. There is a systematic relationship between the design of automated vehicles and the types of accidents that are occurring now and will inevitably continue to occur in the future. These accidents were not unforeseeable and the drivers were not exclusively to blame."

Or rather, it didn't, because the meeting was completely delocalized with the speakers, organizers, and attendees scattered across six continents and hundreds of locations, connected via a video-conferencing tool and social media. Despite this ""delocalisation,"" the meeting retained many characteristics of a traditional conference: invited and contributed talks with follow-up questions and discussion, and a poster session. However, unlike with traditional conferences, all attendees avoided air travel, high registration costs (it was completely free), CO2 emission, or visa issues. Surely the impact on families was minimized as well, though participants in inconvenient time zones had to wake up early or stay up late. In this Comment, we highlight the key steps that enabled this event, offering tips and advice, to aid the organisation of similar Online Meetups."

Large scale structural models were obtained by fitting experimental datasets simultaneously with the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. Models, relying only on experimental data and basic physical information without constraining the average coordination numbers, give 3.9 - 4.1 for the number of the atoms in the first coordination sphere of Ge atoms, while the average number of first neighbors of Ga atoms scatters around 3.8. The average coordination number of Te atoms is significantly higher than 2 for $x$ = 12.5 and 14.3. It is found that the vast majority of MTe$_4$ (M=Ge or Ga) tetrahedra have at least one corner sharing MTe$_4$ neighbor."

Our results are derived by a Floquet-Keldysh-Green's formalism with Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) and a second order iterative perturbation theory solver (IPT). We find that the Fano resonance which originates from coupling of the continuum of electronic density of states to the semiconductor Mie resonator yields polaritons with lifetimes between 0.6 ps and 1.45 ps. These results are compared to ZnO polariton lasers and to ZnO random lasers. We interpret the peaks of the exciton-polariton lifetimes in our results as a sign of gain narrowing which may lead to stable polariton lasing modes in the single excited ZnO Mie resonator. This form of gain may lead to polariton random lasing in an ensemble of ZnO Mie resonators in the non-equilibrium.

Note that for non-Boolean queries, the size of the query result may be far too large to be computed entirely within FPT time. We investigate the free-connex variant of submodular width and generalise Marx's result to non-Boolean queries as follows: For every class $\Phi$ of CQs of bounded free-connex submodular width, within FPT-preprocessing time we can build a data structure that allows to enumerate, without repetition and with constant delay, all tuples of the query result. Our proof builds upon Marx's splitting routine to decompose the query result into a union of results; but we have to tackle the additional technical difficulty to ensure that these can be enumerated efficiently."

In addition to its importance for emerging photonic and optoelectronic applications, this class of materials is also a rich platform to highlight the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamic driving forces during growth of strained, nonequilibrium alloys. Indeed, these alloys are inherently strained and supersaturated in Sn and thus can suffer instabilities that are still to be fully elucidated. In this vein, in this work the atomic-scale microstructure of Ge0.82Sn0.18 is investigated at the onset of phase separation as the epitaxial growth aborts. In addition to the expected accumulation of Sn on the surface leading to Sn-rich droplets and sub-surface regions with the anticipated equilibrium Sn composition of 1.0at.%, the diffusion of Sn atoms also yields conspicuous Sn-decorated filaments with nonuniform Sn content in the range of ~1 to 11at.% . The latter are attributed to the formation and propagation of dislocations, facilitating the Sn transport toward the surface through pipe diffusion. Furthermore, the interface between the Sn droplet and GeSn shows a distinct, defective layer with Sn content of ~22at.%. This layer is likely formed by the expelled excess equilibrium Ge as the Sn solidifies, and its content seems to be a consequence of strain minimization between tetragonal Sn-rich and cubic Ge-rich equilibrium phases. The elucidation of these phenomena is crucial to understand the stability of GeSn semiconductors and control their epitaxial growth at a uniform composition."

The states in (1+1)-$d$ are associated with Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with multiple $S^1$ boundaries and we use replica trick to compute the entanglement entropy for such states. In (2+1)-$d$, we focus on the states associated with torus link complements which live in the tensor product of Hilbert spaces associated with multiple $T^2$. We present a quantitative analysis of the entanglement structure for both abelian and non-abelian groups. For all the states considered in this work, we find that the entanglement entropy for direct product of groups is the sum of entropy for individual groups, i.e. $\text{EE}(G_1 \times G_2) = \text{EE}(G_1)+\text{EE}(G_2)$. Moreover, the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out a subset of the total Hilbert space has a positive semidefinite partial transpose on any bi-partition of the remaining Hilbert space."

Special simulation techniques are required to address this study since the nucleation of a critical vapor bubble --one that has equal chance to grow or shrink-- in a moderately superheated liquid is a rare event. We use the Seeding method, that combines Classical Nucleation Theory with computer simulations of a liquid containing a vapor bubble to provide bubble nucleation rates in a wide temperature range. Seeding has been successfully applied to investigate the nucleation of crystals in supercooled fluids and here we apply it for the fist time --to the best of our knowledge-- to the liquid-to-vapor transition. We find that Seeding provides nucleation rates that are consistent with independent calculations not based on the assumptions of Classical Nucleation Theory. Different criteria to determine the radius of the critical bubble give different rate values. The accuracy of each criterion depends of the degree of superheating. Moreover, Seeding simulations show that the surface tension depends on pressure for a given temperature. Therefore, using Classical Nucleation Theory with the coexistence surface tension does not provide good estimates of the nucleation rate."

In this review, we present the host galaxy properties of all TDE candidates known to date and quantify their distributions. We consider throughout the differences between observationally-identified types of TDEs and differences from spectroscopic control samples of galaxies. We focus here on the black hole and stellar masses of TDE host galaxies, their star formation histories and stellar populations, the concentration and morphology of the optical light, the presence of AGN activity, and the extra-galactic environment of the TDE hosts. We summarize the state of several possible explanations for the links between the TDE rate and host galaxy type. We present estimates of the TDE rate for different host galaxy types and quantify the degree to which rate enhancement in some types results in rate suppression in others. We discuss the possibilities for using TDE host galaxies to assist in identifying TDEs in upcoming large transient surveys and possibilities for TDE observations to be used to study their host galaxies."

Here, we investigate exfoliated layers of InSe and GaSe ranging from bulk crystals down to monolayer, encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, using Raman spectroscopy. We present the N-dependence of both intralayer vibrations within each atomic layer, as well as of the interlayer shear and layer breathing modes. A linear chain model can be used to describe the evolution of the peak positions as a function of N, consistent with first principles calculations."

In periodic crystals, the LLs are imprinted with lattice properties; plateaus in the transverse Hall conductivity are not equidistant in energy anymore. Herein, crystals with a polyatomic basis are considered. For a stripe arrangement of different atoms, the band structure resorts nontrivially and exhibits strong oscillations that form a salient pattern with very small bandgaps. The Hall conductivity strongly decreases for energies within these bands, and only sharp peaks remain for energies in the gap. These effects are traced back to open orbits in the initial band structure; the corresponding LLs are formed from states with positive and negative effective mass. The partial cancellation of transverse charge conductivity also holds for different polyatomic stripe lattices and even when the magnetic field is replaced by a topologically nontrivial spin texture. The topological Hall effect is suppressed in the presence of magnetic skyrmions. The discussion is complemented by calculations of Hofstadter butterflies and orbital magnetization."

Outgassing of Common Rock and the   Stability of Liquid Water,"Little is known about the interaction between atmospheres and crusts of exoplanets so far, but future space missions and ground-based instruments are expected to detect molecular features in the spectra of hot rocky exoplanets. We aim to understand the composition of the gas in an exoplanet atmosphere which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust. Methods. The molecular composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid materials is determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure, temperature and element abundances. We study total element abundances that represent different parts of the Earth's crust (Continental Crust, Bulk Silicate Earth, Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), CI chondrites and abundances measured in polluted white dwarfs. For temperatures between 600K and 3500K, the near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly composed of H2O, CO2, SO2 and in some cases of O2 and H2. For temperatures 500K, only N2-rich or CH4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500K, the atmospheric gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO, CaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700K and inhibit the presence of liquid water. Measurements of the atmospheric composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet crusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers, but do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules might be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical equilibrium."

Resilience interventions mitigate such risks, but access can be hindered by systemic and personal barriers. While much work has recently addressed designing technology to promote mental health, none has focused on the needs of these populations. This paper presents the results of interviews with 18 professional/ volunteer support workers and 5 unaccompanied migrant youths, followed by three design workshops. The results point to the diverse systems that can facilitate youths' resilience development. The relationship between the youth and volunteers acting as mentors is particularly important for increasing resilience but comes with challenges. This suggests the relevance of a social-ecological model of resilience with a focus on designing technology to support the mentors in order to help them better support the youth. We conclude by mapping out the design space for mentor support."

We obtain a $D_n(4000)$-independent average attenuation curve for spaxels with $1.1\leq D_n(4000)<1.3$, which is similar to the one derived from either local starbursts or normal SFGs. We examine whether and how the shape of the average attenuation curve changes with several local and global physical properties. For spaxels with $1.2\leq D_n(4000)<1.3$, we find no dependence on either local or global physical properties for the shape of the average attenuation curve. However, for spaxels with younger stellar population ($1.1\leq D_n(4000)<1.2$), shallower average attenuation curves are found for star-forming regions with smaller stellar mass surface density, smaller star formation rate surface density, or those residing in the outer region of galaxies. These results emphasize the risk of using one single attenuation curve to correct the dust reddening for all types of star-forming regions, especially for those with fairly young stellar population."

Making a single-moon system is known to be more difficult than multiple-moon or moonless systems. We aim to find a way to form a system with a single large moon, such as Titan around Saturn. We examine the orbital migration of moons, which change their direction and speed depending on the properties of circumplanetary disks. We modeled dissipating circumplanetary disks with taking the effect of temperature structures into account and calculated the orbital evolution of Titan-mass satellites in the final evolution stage of various circumplanetary disks. We also performed N-body simulations of systems that initially had multiple satellites to see whether single-moon systems remained at the end. The radial slope of the disk-temperature structure characterized by the dust opacity produces a patch of orbits in which the Titan-mass moons cease inward migration and even migrate outward in a certain range of the disk viscosity. The patch assists moons initially located in the outer orbits to remain in the disk, while those in the inner orbits fall onto the planet. We demonstrate for the first time that systems can form that have only one large moon around giant planet. Our N-body simulations suggest satellite formation was not efficient in the outer radii of circumplanetary disks."

For this purpose, the theoretical foundations of KOS are reviewed based on conceptualizations introduced by the Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS); natural language processing techniques are also implemented. Applying a comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus (Eurovoc), a subject headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts and relations. It was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of character strings (nomens) rather than on the modelling of semantics; their definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they comprise a large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent definition of what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to the modelling of relations. Ontologies explicitly define diverse types of relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The paper concludes that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of each KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to represent subject headings and classification schemes as semantic networks with nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable for such a representation. In addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling of relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves."

While much study has been conducted on how password composition policies (sets of rules that a user must abide by when creating a password) influence the distribution of user-chosen passwords on a system, much less research has been done on inferring the password composition policy that a given set of user-chosen passwords was created under. In this paper, we state the problem with the naive approach to this challenge, and suggest a simple approach that produces more reliable results. We also present pol-infer, a tool that implements this approach, and demonstrates its use in inferring password composition policies."

We include an H2-based star-formation law, as well as a detailed chemical-enrichment model with explicit mass-dependent delay times for SN-II, SN-Ia and AGB stars. Information about the star formation, feedback and chemical-enrichment histories of discs is stored in 12 concentric rings. The new model retains the success of its predecessor in reproducing the observed evolution of the galaxy population, in particular, stellar mass functions and passive fractions over the redshift range 0<=z<=3 and mass range 8<=log(M_*/Msun)<=12, the black hole-bulge mass relation at z=0, galaxy morphology as a function of stellar mass and the mass-metallicity relations of both stellar and gas components. In addition, its detailed modelling of the radial structure of discs allows qualitatively new comparisons with observation, most notably with the relative sizes and masses of the stellar, atomic and molecular components in discs. Good agreement is found with recent data. Comparison of results obtained for simulations differing in mass resolution by more than two orders of magnitude shows that all important distributions are numerically well converged even for this more detailed model. An examination of metallicity and surface-density gradients in the stars and gas indicates that our new model, with star formation, chemical enrichment and feedback calculated self-consistently on local disc scales, reproduces some but not all of the trends seen in recent many-galaxy IFU surveys."

Typical rate-control algorithms rely on bit allocation strategies, to appropriately distribute bits among frames. As reference frames are essential for exploiting temporal redundancies, intra frames are usually assigned a larger portion of the available bits. In this paper, an accurate method to estimate number of bits and quality of intra frames is proposed, which can be used for bit allocation in a rate-control scheme. The algorithm is based on deep learning, where networks are trained using the original frames as inputs, while distortions and sizes of compressed frames after encoding are used as ground truths. Two approaches are proposed where either local or global distortions are predicted."

These systems act as license plates used on automobiles, but they transmit information using radio waves. To be useful, the transmissions in such systems need to reach long distances to minimize the number of ground stations to capture these transmissions. LoRaWAN is designed as a cheap long-range technology to be used for long-range communication for the Internet of Things. Several manufacturers make LoRaWAN modules, which are readily available on the market and are, therefore, ideal for the UAVs Remote IDs at a low cost. In this paper, we present our experiences in using LoRaWAN technology as a communication technology. Our experiments to identify and locate the UAV systems uncovered several issues of using LoRaWAN in such systems that are documented in this paper. Using several ground stations, we can determine the location of a UAV equipped with a LoRaWAN module that transmits the UAV Remote ID. Hence, it can help identify UAVs that unintentionally, or intentionally, fly into restricted zones."

We present a study on the temperature dependent PL and PL decay dynamics of lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals characterized by different types of A cations, surface ligands, and nanocrystal sizes. Throughout, we observe a single emission peak from cryogenic to ambient temperature. The PL decay dynamics are dominated by the surface passivation, and a post-synthesis ligand exchange with a quaternary ammonium bromide (QAB) results in a more stable passivation over a larger temperature range. The PL intensity is highest from 50K-250K, which indicates that the ligand binding competes with the thermal energy at ambient temperature. Despite the favorable PL dynamics of nanocrystals passivated with QAB ligands (monoexponential PL decay over a large temperature range, increased PL intensity and stability), the surface passivation still needs improvement toward increased emission intensity in nanocrystal films."

In this paper, we call for a shift that flips this paradigm upside down. Specifically, we propose a ""small data for big tasks"" paradigm, wherein a single artificial intelligence (AI) system is challenged to develop ""common sense"", enabling it to solve a wide range of tasks with little training data. We illustrate the potential power of this new paradigm by reviewing models of common sense that synthesize recent breakthroughs in both machine and human vision. We identify functionality, physics, intent, causality, and utility (FPICU) as the five core domains of cognitive AI with humanlike common sense. When taken as a unified concept, FPICU is concerned with the questions of ""why"" and ""how"", beyond the dominant ""what"" and ""where"" framework for understanding vision. They are invisible in terms of pixels but nevertheless drive the creation, maintenance, and development of visual scenes. We therefore coin them the ""dark matter"" of vision. Just as our universe cannot be understood by merely studying observable matter, we argue that vision cannot be understood without studying FPICU. We demonstrate the power of this perspective to develop cognitive AI systems with humanlike common sense by showing how to observe and apply FPICU with little training data to solve a wide range of challenging tasks, including tool use, planning, utility inference, and social learning. In summary, we argue that the next generation of AI must embrace ""dark"" humanlike common sense for solving novel tasks."

We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2-H2 collision-induced absorption is capable of bringing the surface temperature above freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles occur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that collision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars, but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ~600 Tmol/yr) and at high surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived collision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2 outgassing rate as low as ~300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars.

In this paper, with comprehensive ultrafast studies, we reported the energy migration pathway from MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to local environment under plasmonic excitation. Our data found that in water, energy dissipation is divided into fast hydrogen bond mediated channel and slow lattice motion mediated channel.The experimental results suggest that in water, nearly 80% energy in MXene that gained from the photoexcitation quickly dissipates into surrounding water molecules within 7 ps as a hydrogen bond mediated fast channel, and the remaining energy vanishes with time constant ~100 ps as a lattice motion mediated slow channel. The fast energy migration would result in the prominent interfacial energy conductance 150-300 MW *m{-2}* K{-1} for MXene-water interface. Tuning the solvent into ethanol could both narrow the energy dissipation to 35% through the fast channel and slow down the thermal channel (400 ps). To gain the molecular insight, molecular dynamic results presented different solvents had significantly different H bond forming ability on MXene surface. Our results suggested that interfacial interaction is crucial for effective hydrogen bonds on MXene surface to channel the excitation dissipation, providing important insights into the photothermal applications with MXene."

We explore this effect after considering different input states, in the form of either coherent, or Twin-Fock, or NOON states. We first review the non-interacting limit and the case in which only the local interaction is present, including the study of sensitivity near the self-trapping threshold. Then, we consider the two-mode model in the presence of inter-well interactions and consider the scaling of the sensitivity as a function of the non-local coupling strength. Our analysis clearly shows that non-local interactions can compensate the degradation of the sensitivity induced by local interactions, so that they may be used to restore optimal sensitivity."

We investigate the exciton2 phonon coupling in giant-shell CdSe/CdS core-shell nanocrystals via resonant Raman spectroscopy. The Huang-Rhys parameter is evaluated by the intensity ratio of the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon of CdS with its first multiscattering (2LO) replica. We used four different excitation wavelengths in the range from the onset of the CdS shell absorption to well above the CdS shell band edge to get insight into resonance effects of the CdS LO phonon with high energy excitonic transitions. The isotropic spherical giant-shell nanocrystals show consistently stronger exciton-phonon coupling as compared to the anisotropic rod-shaped dot-in-rod (DiR) architecture, and the 2LO/LO intensity ratio decreases for excitation wavelengths approaching the CdS band edge. The strong exciton-phonon coupling in the spherical giant-shell nanocrystals can be related to the delocalization of the electronic wave functions. Furthermore, we observe the radial breathing modes of the GS nanocrystals and their overtones by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy with nonresonant excitation, using laser energies well below the band gap of the heteronanocrystals, and highlight the differences between higher order"

However, most existing KG embedding models neglect space and, therefore, do not perform well when applied to (geo)spatial data and tasks. For those models that consider space, most of them primarily rely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational complexity during training while still losing information beyond the relative distance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KG embedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such as point coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KG embedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types of spatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as a set of geographic query-answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performance of SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that SE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logic query answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our spatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale of different geographic entities. Finally, we introduce a novel downstream task called spatial semantic lifting which links an arbitrary location in the study area to entities in the KG via some relations. Evaluation on DBGeo shows that our model outperforms the baseline by a substantial margin."

Yet, how precisely cells as individual mechanical entities can act to morph a tissue reliably and efficiently into three dimensions during outgrowth is still puzzling especially when cells are tightly connected as in plant tissue. In plants, the mechanics of cells within a tissue is particularly well defined as individual cell growth is essentially the mechanical yielding of cell-wall in response to internal turgor pressure. Cell wall stiffness is controlled by biological signalling and, hence, cell growth is observed to respond to mechanical stresses building up within a tissue. What is the role of the mechanical feedback during morphing of tissue in three dimensions? Here, we develop a three dimensional vertex model to investigate tissue mechanics at the onset of organ outgrowth at the tip of a plant shoot. We find that organ height is primarily governed by the ratio of growth rates of faster growing cells initiating the organ to slower growing cells surrounding them. Remarkably, the outgrowth rate is higher when cells growth responds to the tissue-wide mechanical stresses. Our quantitative analysis of simulation data shows that tissue mechanical feedback on cell growth can act via twofold mechanism. First, the feedback guides patterns of cellular growth. Second, the feedback modifies the stress patterns on the cells, consequently amplifying and propagating growth anisotropies. This mechanism may allow plants to grow organs efficiently out of the meristem by reorganizing the cellular growth rather than inflating growth rates."

Symbolic BDD-based representations have been also shown to be successful for the analysis of families of systems that arise, e.g., through configurable parameters or following the feature-oriented modeling approach. The state space of such system families face an additional exponential blowup in the number of parameters or features. It is well known that the order of variables in ordered BDDs is crucial for the size of the model representation. Especially for automatically generated models from real-world systems, family models might even be not constructible due to bad variable orders. In this paper we describe a technique, called iterative variable reordering, that can enable the construction of large-scale family models. We exemplify feasibility of our approach by means of an aircraft velocity control system with redundancy mechanisms modeled in the input language of the probabilistic model checker PRISM. We show that standard reordering and dynamic reordering techniques fail to construct the family model due to memory and time constraints, respectively, while the new iterative approach succeeds to generate a symbolic family model."

X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were reported. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed dual crystalline structure of the films with collagen-type bundles of triple helices, intercalated inside clay platelets, increasing interlayer distances. Depending on the renaturation of triple-helices and Laponite content, the glass transition temperatures substantially decreased. The amount of helices decreased with Lap concentration, affecting the enthalpy of melting. The nanocomposite gelatin films showed improved thermal stability. Changes of water vapor permeability could be related to the presence of larger free volume of the coils and intercalated structures, facilitating water transfer through the film."

It is based on a well-established supervised end-to-end DCNN model, known as U-net. U-net is firstly modified by adding widely used batch normalization and residual block (named as BRU-net) to improve the efficiency of model training. Based on BRU-net, we further introduce a dynamically weighted cross-entropy loss function. The weighting scheme is calculated based on the pixel-wise prediction accuracy during the training process. Assigning higher weights to pixels with lower segmentation accuracies enables the network to learn more from poorly predicted image regions. Our method is named as feedback weighted U-net (FU-net). We have evaluated our method based on T1- weighted brain MRI for the segmentation of midbrain and substantia nigra, where the number of pixels in each class is extremely unbalanced to each other. Based on the dice coefficient measurement, our proposed FU-net has outperformed BRU-net and U-net with statistical significance, especially when only a small number of training examples are available. The code is publicly available in GitHub (GitHub link: https://github.com/MinaJf/FU-net)."

However, unsupervised networks have long lagged behind the performance of their supervised counterparts, especially in the domain of large-scale visual recognition. Recent developments in training deep convolutional embeddings to maximize non-parametric instance separation and clustering objectives have shown promise in closing this gap. Here, we describe a method that trains an embedding function to maximize a metric of local aggregation, causing similar data instances to move together in the embedding space, while allowing dissimilar instances to separate. This aggregation metric is dynamic, allowing soft clusters of different scales to emerge. We evaluate our procedure on several large-scale visual recognition datasets, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised transfer learning performance on object recognition in ImageNet, scene recognition in Places 205, and object detection in PASCAL VOC."

Over the past few years, several studies have indicated how mindfulness-based interventions may be effectively used to remediate OCD symptoms based on which such methods are endorsed as effective complementary or alternative options to remediate OCD. The present pilot investigation assessed the effectiveness of Geometric Meditation-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (GM-CBT) as a novel integrated approach to help OCD symptoms. Accordingly, an eight-week treatment program (90 minute sessions per week) in a single case of intractable OCD was found to result in a significant reduction in OCD symptoms, anxiety and depression as well as increased mindfulness skills and subsequent secondary outcomes. A three-month post treatment follow up suggested long-lasting beneficial effects. Such a pilot model may receive further endorsement as a holistic CBT approach for OCD."

The most sensitive known method to establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino is detection of the ultra-rare process of neutrinoless double beta decay. However, identification of one or a handful of decay events within a large mass of candidate isotope, without obfuscation by backgrounds is a formidable experimental challenge. One hypothetical method for achieving ultra-low-background neutrinoless double beta decay sensitivity is the detection of single $^{136}$Ba ions produced in the decay of $^{136}$Xe (`barium tagging'). To implement such a method, a single-ion-sensitive barium detector must be developed and demonstrated in bulk liquid or dry gaseous xenon. This paper reports on the development of two families of dry-phase barium chemosensor molecules for use in high pressure xenon gas detectors, synthesized specifically for this purpose. One particularly promising candidate, an anthracene substituted aza-18-crown-6 ether, is shown to respond in the dry phase with almost no intrinsic background from the unchelated state, and to be amenable to barium sensing through fluorescence microscopy. This interdisciplinary advance, paired with earlier work demonstrating sensitivity to single barium ions in solution, opens a new path toward single ion detection in high pressure xenon gas."

At the achieved resolution of $\sim$$1^{\prime\prime}.2\times0^{\prime\prime}.9$ ($8\times6$~kpc$^2$), the CO(7-6) emission is largely unresolved (with a deconvolved size of $1^{\prime\prime}.1(\pm0^{\prime\prime}.5) \times 0^{\prime\prime}.9(\pm0^{\prime\prime}.8)$), and the continuum emission is totally unresolved. The CO(7-6) line emission has an integrated flux of $0.86\pm0.08$~Jy km/s, and a line width of $343\pm40$ km/s. The continuum emission has a flux density of 0.51 mJy. By fitting the observed far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distribution of LESS 073 with a single-temperature modified blackbody function, we obtained a dust temperature $T_{\rm dust}=57.6\pm3.5$ K, 60-to-100 $\mu$m flux density ratio $f_{60}/f_{100}=0.86\pm0.08$, and total infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}=(5.8\pm0.9) \times 10^{12}~L_\odot$. The SED-fit-based $f_{60}/f_{100}$ is consistent with those estimated from various line ratios as advocated by our earlier work, indicating that those proposed line-ratio-based method can be used to practically derive $f_{60}/f_{100}$ for high-$z$ sources. The total molecular gas mass of LESS 073 is $(3.3\pm1.7) \times10^{10}~M_\odot$, and the inferred gas depletion time is about 43 Myr."

The primary excitation channel for fast hydrogen atoms in injected neutral beams, with energy in the range of 25-1000 keV, is due to collisions with protons and impurity ions (e.g., He$^{2+}$ and heavier impurities). As a result of such excitation, at the particle density of 10$^{13}$-10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$, the line intensities of the Stark multiplets do not follow statistical expectations (i.e., the populations of fine-structure levels within the same principal quantum number $n$ are not proportional to their statistical weights). Hence, any realistic modeling of MSE spectra has to include the relevant collisional atomic data. In this paper we provide a general expression for the excitation cross sections in parabolic states within $n$=3 for an arbitrary orientation between the direction of the motion-induced electric field and the proton-atom collisional axis. The calculations make use of the density matrix obtained with the atomic orbital close coupling method and the method can be applied to other collisional systems (e.g., He$^{2+}$, Be$^{4+}$, C$^{6+}$, etc.). The resulting cross sections are given as simple fits that can be directly applied to spectral modeling. For illustration we note that the asymmetry detected in the first classical cathode ray experiments between the red- and blue-shifted spectral components can be quantitatively studied using the proposed approach."
